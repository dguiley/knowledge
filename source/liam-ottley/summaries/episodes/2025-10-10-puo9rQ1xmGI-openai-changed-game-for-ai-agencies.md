# OpenAI Changed Game for AI Agencies

This episode, hosted by Liam Ottley, explores the transformative impact of OpenAI's recent updates on AI agencies, focusing on the potential of new AI tools.

## Core Thesis

OpenAI has introduced a suite of tools—agent kit, agent builder, and chatkit—revolutionizing how AI agencies deliver services by enabling no-code multi-agent system creation, thereby enhancing accessibility and reducing reliance on developers. This innovation signifies a shift towards efficiency, customization, and cost-effective direct API usage, positioning agencies strategically in a rapidly evolving AI landscape.

## Key Insights

- Introduction of no-code tools like the agent kit and chatkit empowers agencies to build AI systems more efficiently and cost-effectively without deep technical expertise.
- Significant improvements in development speed and operational performance can be achieved through these tools, enabling agencies to offer more agile and competitive services.
- Direct use of OpenAI’s ecosystem offers substantial cost-saving benefits, eliminating the need for intermediary platforms and aligning with client priorities on outcomes over processes.

## Actionable Takeaways

1. Leverage new no-code tools for enhancing service delivery and building competitive, custom AI applications.
2. Encourage adoption of chatkit and similar tools to streamline the creation of branded interfaces connecting clients’ AI systems.
3. Regularly update operational strategies to integrate the latest AI developments and maintain competitiveness in the agency sphere.

## Notable Quotes

> "Being an agency in the space is like such a good idea... you get to benefit from all the updates."

> "Clients don't care how they get it. They just want the thing."

> "This is essentially cutting out the middleman…you’re going to be getting essentially the raw API costs which is very very cheap compared to a lot of these platforms."
