# Generate Endless Startup Ideas

Published: 2024-10-17

in this video I want to show you a method to spot solvable problems in high demand markets very quickly uh it's a three step or four steps if we add the the bonus um three step method that goes from ideation and for that I'm going to talk to you about the Three core markets U which is not obviously the place where every um entrepreneur start by looking at um unfortunately because it's it's a very good place to start with uh then I will show you how to um dig into those three core markets into niches sub nishes and so on until you find something interesting that spark uh an idea that you can pursue then once you pick an idea we can uh we will use two tools mostly which are Google and a an a Chrome extension which is keywords everywhere to Simply dig into um a specific topic so we we start with just an idea and then we we go a little bit deeper and deeper and we check the different Trends to see if there is demand and then we go back down and we narrow down within the market until we start uh finding some opportunities uh along our research uh here it's not opening but you will see here yeah and then we start putting some potential problems uh at this point normally you are good to go already you you have something solid you can really dig into um and then also showing you how you can dig even more into it by using AI to mine basically first you will go and gather raw data um on places like YouTube YouTube commands Reddit and gigabrain which is U Reddit with AI you will I will show you how to uh gather this data and use this prompt so in the end you have um a list of pain points that um people are experimenting in the market that you already have uh validated as in demand um and then you can just start really ideating on what solution you can uh create for this programs so that's not a full um a toz video on how to start a business but it's a video that will um bring you from I don't know I don't have an idea or I don't know where to search to the point where you are you start generating um very precise business ideas um and then you can move uh on move forward after that so I hope uh the program um uh seems good for you it's already a three minute introduction so let's go into it right now uh before we go um first the documents that I'm going to work through you can find it um in the description uh and also I already used an example the ones the one with the screenshot that you have seen uh so I will walk you through the same example so we don't end up like wasting time um I found this one but you can recreate that for basically every single Market all right let's go ideation The Three core markets what is that um this is a concept that have been brought by I don't know actually who brought that but it's it's very well known especially in the world of marketing it means that people are willing to spend money without hesitation into those three markets which are health wealth and relationship but at the very beginning of advertising um there wasn't a lot of competitions so you didn't need to go very far into those markets to find a good product but the more competition the more um businesses had to uh narrow down and go on different submarkets so here for example if I just open Health by the way here it's a document that you can um have access to if I go into health I can see that there is Fitness there is nutrition mental health preventive health alternative medicine and so on and so forth I have put into this document a bunch of them but obviously it's not the complete list um I don't even know if a complete list exist but the cool thing is what I'm going to show you afterward is a AI generator uh it's a GPT basically that I've created that will allow you to create those niches and sub niches on demand um I will show you that right after first let's uh continue on what are these exactly so you have the the core market and you take the the first one house and then you go down and then you have the first categories then if you go a little a step further within nutrition you also have diet plans and you have supplements those are sub niches in the category of nutrition but then if you go a step further then within diet plan you have ketogenic diets which I'm not familiar with and plant plant-based diet so those are two sub niches within the diet plan sub nishes within the nutrition Niche within the Health cor market and then you can even go a little bit further plant-based nutrition for bodybuilders right plant-based diet for families you can go on and on and it's at the very last step of this at the very last Branch you have an Infinity of nishes disclaimer here all those nich is are not validated right they are generated by AI just on the fact that it starts with the cor market and narrow down and go sub nishes after sub nishes until the point we have something that is quite unique that is probably that is we are looking for blue ocean for you for yourself and the more you narrow down the less competition but also the less demand the less people I have no idea if plant-based for diet for families is a thing or not but that is what we are going to look at in the next step we are going to start with something that sounds good that we are like oh yeah I would like to dig into that and see if there is demand if there is uh people looking for that if there is if it's going up or down and so on let's go back this is the document where you start um your journey basically you just look at the document I've created so you you get ideas and because you are probably uh all the the ideas are not there assuming you want to let's keep our example uh assuming I like Diet plants and U I'm like I just want to dig into that uh by the way you also have the same thing for wealth and for relationship here so you have a bunch of things to start with but assuming uh let's keep this example oh no let's start with the example um I am going to use let me pause one second all right I found it back so here I am in the wealth core market and I want to dig into personal finance so because I am only interested by that we are going to create the same kind of uh branches but just starting with personal finance and that's the GPT I told you about that I created you just have to click here and you will be brought to the GPT the three cor markets ideas generator nice name isn't it uh I just start by giving the name so here you have conversation starter just so you know approximately what you can do but if you start with um a niche normally if it works it should give me this uh three three that starts after the one I said so it says well personal finance and now budgeting saving strategies debt management retirement planning investing investment planning Credit Management tax planning fral living Financial education Financial technology F Tech all right and because I like my maps you can just copy here and click on the link that it gives you so it will allow you to create something like that it's just it's just for fun basically uh because we have seen already the the name of the niches but it's nice to have it as a m map so you can go back to it let me pause and I go back I come back right after okay that's the magic of editing it's already done so just so you know it's the Windle diagram GPT which you just have to give a something like that and then it creates the main map now I just have to open it and I have a similar mind map but this time that starts with personal finance I have way more uh sub nishes for personal finance and here you can start simply looking at the one you are familiar with you want to dig in all right my example is not in this one it was not generated although it's a quite good one I will show you what high I had when I did it um so I got personal finance family budgeting budgeting with children and child related expense tracking well I thought that's interesting um first because children are generally good Niche uh whatever touch children is uh people are are willing to spend money on and also expense tracking made me think of some kind of templates those are business ideas that are not really hard to um create the solution that are not hard to create so I decided to go with this one now we start on the Second Step let's close this one I want to validate uh if there is demand how do I do that well right now I got sorry go back here just something that Sparks an idea budgeting with children family budgeting child related expense tracking I don't especially want that I just want to dig into this market so family budgeting I will just try to go on Google and and type some something that I think is related to to it family financial planning that's what what I decided to go for during my first try and this is the moment where we start using the app I told you about uh which is keywords everywhere as you can see here it's in my Chrome extension it's not free uh you have I mean honestly it's it's cheap for what it is the very small subscription you get credit and what it does is that every time you are going to type something here it will give you the the volume of the keywords you are using and it will give you some Trends information here and all the related keyword with the volume of each keyword so it's a very interesting uh tool honestly I love to have it all the time so when I'm just using the web I always have ideas that are uh just coming up just by having it all the time but you can also turn it off and reopen it whenever you need anyway so if you want to go for it just uh use it you have a free uh Chrome extension which is called it's SEO Surfer I think extension yeah keyw software which does pretty much the same thing and it's free but honestly I've used both and I love to use keywords everywhere so you decide all right so I got my first thing that came to my mind and now I'm going to look at the related keyword and here I can see that family Finance seems to be a term that is on top of the three the three it's like it's a big topic so I'm just going there so I kind of move up a little bit for my research here I'm at the market level I'm not deep into what we say so before I'm not here I'm more somewhere here okay I know that there is um almost 50,000 search per month which is a fair number what I want to know now is how is the market going is it going up stagnating or going down and this is where we use uh Google Trend which I didn't mention I love to use Google Trend and again keywords everywhere is part of Google Trend I mean is integrated with Google Trend you can see it here the normal Google Trend looks like that and with keyword everywhere you also have the volume and you have this nice curve that helps you to see how it goes all right so I'm just worldwide uh family Finance here I don't have a top I only have the search term which is fine and I'm looking at that so I see that it is slowly growing but what is sure is that it's a solid Market I mean could have guessed it right family Finance is not a new topic but this is just important to mention because in some cases you will have uh a trend that will start here for example or recently you want to be careful with those TRS that are too recent you if there is one it doesn't mean it's bad but you need to understand what's the Catalyst of this trend why did it start so you can kind of predict if it's something that is here to stay or not in our case though we know that it's a Evergreen topic that is never going to go away or at least not in the next century plus it's not going down and it's even going a little bit up so that's a good Market to be in and to do research uh within all right so now we have our top Market we we kind of if we go back from the very beginning we just got an idea within the the big document of the the three cor markets we got deeper onto it and picked one market to dig in while digging into this Market we went from a random search to the major search of the the the topic and we just confirmed that it is a solid Market to be now we want to dig into it and find Opportunities if I look into my page here my search here now that I have a lot of volume I also have a lot of data that are related to this keyw and I can see this is the one I highlighted in the example here a very interesting one is how much do baby cost babies cost it is the biggest one and again babies is also a good Niche I I know that firsthand um people are willing to spend in babies uh and also there is a Time matter that when a baby is a baby it you cannot delay for two years after it's not a baby anymore uh so it's a good Market but that's just personal uh opinion but if you you you can find another one here I'm not going to go through all of them find Family Finance books but this one kind of it's a question you could see you could imagine different problem behind that so I just decided to start digging into this one now same thing I'm here it tells me the volume is 6,000 so it's a little bit lower but now I'm going to look at all the different related uh queries about that and here I have highlighted them so you can go back and see them all the ones that are uh highlighted are potential um produ or at least they could be part of a solution it doesn't tell you what you can do exactly but look how much does it cost to raise a child infant care seit cost how much does it cost to raise a baby how to budget for a baby how much does baby formula cost um cost of raising a child calculator cost of baby wipes how much does a c cream I don't even know what it is cream cost apparently something that you need to buy I guess it's like the Bagon or something like that or where where they sleep I don't know not exactly anyway you can go on and on and find all the questions people are asking about the topic and already start telling you hey here's the business idea you need to create just telling you okay a lot of people have this program they it's not a problem but they they will have a baby they come on Google and they are looking for stuff and and and you have people like you that are there to help them to have a better life an easier Life by creating Solutions here in my case what I really thought was cool was U the idea of creating um a baby budget uh calculation and I could have gone into um competitor research but it's not in the scope of this video I didn't plan it it before different videos but for for example here at this point I already have a good idea you know I started with nothing and now I know for sure that I am in solid Market uh and I am if I decide to spend more time into digging into the idea of uh a baby uh cost calculator then if it turns out well I in a good market so it it is worth my time so I could have stopped basically the video here and already you have something to work with but I wanted to add something that you that will probably help you to u to go even further and to generate potential ideas because at this point we still have only the market validated but we want to know exactly what are the pain points of the the people in this market and that's why we can use AI to uh first before using AI we need to find where those people are hanging out and then we use the AI to refine this data and to create a list of pink I only uh gave you three places which are big ones here to use but there are plenty and I'm I'm planning on making a video just uh just about that so if you don't want to miss it just subscribe to the the channel it will come soon uh anyway uh YouTube let's start by this one okay I just um did a search with how much do baby baby cost here I want to start looking at the different things that I found here so each of them could be a search query where I will find potential conversations about this topics here I'm on YouTube it's uh I'm not looking for actual conversations but for comments and to find good comments I need to find a good video I'm just looking at those ones how much uh it cost to have baby first year okay breaking down exactly how much it cost what you want is to have enough views so you have enough comments so the people just talk about their pain and and ask questions and that's what you want so let's take this one it's not a big one but it's a first time M with a son who is just okay now I'm going down and as I as you can see we have a lot of commands so what I'm going to do is just to scroll down until the very end okay and now I'm just copying everything so it's quick and doy right we are not creating a database or anything just I copy that uh and then I'm going to use chat GPT again and first I'm coming back here and I am going to grab the prompt that I made available for and I would start this one so it's a long prompt and then I click shift enter shift enter so I'm at the bottom here and then I'm going to just past the data it's here that's the last C and past so now I have my prompts and at the bottom I have all the data I just copied just to have a quick look at the prompt uh basically I am an entrepreneur I'm doing market research uh you are Market researcher expert I'm going to provide provide you with ro data extracted from different sources um instruction formatting I want customer wording sorry your mission is to extract the pain points the the users are facing uh I want to know everything that is relevant for market research purposes and so on and so forth gives a little template and at the end raw data to work from so that's what you see here I have the prompt and then I just pass the RO data afterward and now I just press enter and wait for ideas so that's directly from the comments from this YouTube video High Cost of child care and baby essential so daycare um that's something I've seen a few times in this in this research already formula and feeding costs difficulty with baby supplies and clothing challenges with eco-friendly products what does that mean we close I with the lot of the cost of water okay struggle to find affordable options I recommended checking out um C in store I spend too much on best and good quality them my mom I can't read too much because with my friend sh s I'm I know I'm kidding you so I'm I read in my head you can read it well anyway the purpose here sometimes you could find good data here it can bring you to something but the purpose here is also to move from a potential idea to another at this point before we started I was thinking oh maybe a a baby cost calculator would be a good idea maybe just by reading that it will give me different perspective and show me different problems that are that people are struggling with and if I find a problem uh several time then it means it's something uh that is worth looking at um so yeah you have an example with first YouTube videos and as I mentioned we have other place to look at Reddit so what I would do for Reddit is simply actually Google is better to search on Reddit than Reddit so how much do baby cost Reddit and then see those are the research I've done before so you have the the the amount of commments here so you already know there is plenty of data to work with same principle you just open the sub the r thread you copy everything and you use the prompt and you will get a similar result you can do it several time because I mean those are different conversations so you need obviously you you can just read it you to only use AI you can simply read uh maybe you find something interesting but at least you read the beginning so you you can confirm that you are on something that is related to topic you want to explore and lastly we have gigabrain which if you have never seen it it's um not redit and steroid but it's a imagine um CH GPT directly pluged to uh Reddit same thing it's a you just have to search I could have write it anyway how much those baby babies cost and now it's going to take a bunch of R thread and to summarize it and to give you only the the most important thing so now it's summarizing day care cost health care and insurance one time purchase I don't know what is that c saving tips okay and then you can go down and you see all the different threads uh the data is coming from and you can see also all the subredits it is coming from so one thing you could do is simply use the AI already summarized um part which has a lot of interesting Insight but you can also simply click here open and now you just have the actual wording of the the people and you can open the ones that you want and simply uh copy the data here either all of them or just one of them or three of them and put them into the the same text file that you will use uh at the end of The Prompt like we did with the YouTube command it's exactly the same it's just another place to find the data all right uh here we are we have went through the the whole process I hope that you it made sense for you and it's not too confusing um I tried to keep it short and still it's 30 minutes but I really try to keep it short believe me that's why I didn't want to go too far in the the scope of the video with competitor research and and all the different steps but at least here if you understand this process you can generate infinite ideas of markets to dig in and you can very quickly validate if there is demand for this market and from there you can dig into it and even use AI to spark ideas so you can create or at least spend more time to dig into Solutions in that are already in a validated Market all right if you want to um still dig into market research I going to um put here two videos the one is uh the most famous on my channel the ones I started with about Reddit and the other one is about thrust pilot so this is the same kind of topic if you like this one you will probably like uh the both of them at least I hope I hope you enjoyed it and I see you in the next video bye-bye
