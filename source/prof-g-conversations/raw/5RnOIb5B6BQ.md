It just strikes me that the parties would be so much smarter to put up someone under the age of a 100 yeah but we all keep banging our heads against the wall and saying why can't they be better right and the answer is they're not capable of it the kind of people who run for office are desperately self-loathing insecure people who can't live out the validation of holding office and they're never going to pick the public good over their own personal good and that's true throughout politics Bradley where does this podcast find you I am at my office on 20th in park let's bust right into it most people know you as kind of a political operative SL player but you're also venture capitalist and you're raising what your third fund uh raising our fourth investing out of our third oh good for you so give us the state of the union or where you think the atmospherics are around Venture Capital right now so I mean I think that we're hopefully towards the tail end of a per period where there's been a lot of Il lack of liquidity not a lot of m&amp;a very few IPOs you know I think if interest rates are cut and that should happen at some point according you know in the next 12 months that will probably open things back up if you are me and you're a VC um you haven't enjoyed the last few years because you haven't made any money however from a macro standpoint it was probably pretty good for Venture Capital technology and the economy over all because we had way too many startups valued at way too much money we had way too many Venture Capital funds who really had no reason to exist and what this is doing is a it's going to get rid of a lot of the stuff that shouldn't have existed and B it's going to rightsize valuations so rather than a company going public at 70 billion and then being immediately cut by the public markets by 80% um things will be where they should be in the first place and isn't the taale that Wags The Dog the IPO markets that we need a half a dozen to a dozen monster venture-backed IPOs to inspire liquidity and froth and kind of the animal spirits and we kind of had a head fake in Q3 of last year a couple firms got out but they're broken IPOs or many of them are you see that coming in the back half of this year yeah I mean I I think so I mean there's definitely talk about it I have one company Circle that I think this is public has said they filed their S1 uh they're in the big in the crypto space um so yeah I I think so but I still think that like you said it's almost everyone's waiting for someone to go first and I think generally people are waiting for Powell to go but at the same time if some IPOs got put on the books and they did well then I think everyone else would follow suit pretty quickly what do you think okay so there Circle uh I saw that Shen filed which is a a monster and you know that's a big one what do you know anything about sheen what are your thoughts there not really uh I mean it's it's an interesting company and seems like they sort of built a good model between kind of physical and digital um but you know look all the if if if they can launch a monster IPO and that loosens up the marketplace like great and give us your state of the union regarding the crypto space I think that overall there was clearly a major decline there decline in two ways right so there was the financial decline which we saw as as the prices of Bitcoin ethereum fell there's been some rebounding uh recently in terms of that and then in my world where I tend to focus on the regulatory aspects of tech there had been this kind of inter nescent battle between the cftc and the SEC for who would be the kind of primary crypto regulator in the US the crypto Community preferred the cftc um the traditional Bankers preferred the SEC I think when s bankman freed happened that kind of threw the game over to the SEC right that all of a sudden that discredited the sector enough that that g gzel was able to kind of make his case and that he should be the one to be cracking down on crypto and so uh that I think is sort of been accepted at this point um but with that said you know they've they've filed suit against companies they think are doing things are wrong which is totally what they should be doing but overall there hasn't been as much proactive Crackdown uh by the SEC against crypto as I would have expected and then of course all they really have is the not all but it's the power of their rul making and their enforcement because not getting anything through Congress no one's get anything through Congress one way or the other and then look if Trump wins who knows I don't even know what his views on crypto are he doesn't know what his views on crypto are so like he could appoint it certainly won't be Gary gansler but he could appoint someone around the SEC who's wildly Pro crypto or anti crypto like you know with Biden it will presumably be a continuation of what we have but it's possible in 12 months that like everything's different and so you're raising a fourth fund you're you're small you've raised kind of your bite size if you will as you rais your first one was 35 million and 70 then 139 for fund three how much you trying to raise in fund for uh Target is 200 okay so 200 million is real money but in the world of VC it's small it's a pimp on the elephant so in order to do that you have to you know you have to have a niche you have to specialize what is your pitch what value ad do you bring as opposed to just investing in general Catalyst yeah I mean we are uh as far as I know the only Venture fund that handles all the regulatory political media work for our portfolio company so I I spent the first part of my career as you know working directly in politics I was Mike Bloomberg's campaign man reformator of New York I was the Deputy Governor of Illinois I was Chuck Schumer's communications director in the Senate um and then pivoted at the tech by running the campaigns to legalize Uber and ride sharing all over the US um did it again with clear to get them to airports and then it finally hit me that there was a Nexus between Tech and regulation that I hadn't realized before and launched an early stage Venture fund that in many ways were like every early stage Venture fund we're looking at the founder at the Tam at the underlying concept and Technology but we ask two questions that I think are unique to us first is there a gaining regulatory issue or opportunity that if it was solved can really Drive growth and valuation and if so can we solve it and when the answer is yes to both that's really to make sense for us to invest so our first deal ever was FanDuel then we legalized fantasy sports betting in 16 States our second deal ever was lemonade got them their insurance licenses everywhere Roman legalized prescription via text and so on so you know we are useful if you are a Founder where your company is either taking on entrenched interests that are regulated who are going to try to use the political process to keep you out of business or put you out of business or if you're in a white space entirely whether it's crypto or AI or autonomous vehicles and there's no regulatory framework at all and you've got to create one that works for you and for your industry um that's when we tend to deploy capital and the sales B is pretty simple you I meet with a founder and say okay if you succeed you're going to have the following six regulatory political problems you have two ways to approach them way one would be hire a bunch of different lob Bas Poli consulting firms pay them millions of dollars hopefully they'll solve the problem for you or I can give you five million bucks and do it for free um as a result we tend to win most of our deals in terms of an actual space other than a company that might need some help on the regulatory Side Are there specific Industries or sectors you're most bullish on yeah so digital health I would say is our number one sector because it is one so big right each individual category is a massive industry into itself two so fragmented three so regulated and four so screwed up uh that there's just tons of opportunity for us to be involved so for example we invested in Roman which is a a men's health company now theyve pivot into gp1s and for them it was can you legalize prescription via tax because no one knew for all which is a a mental health company that does all the back office work for therapists so the billing and scheduling and insurance and all of that um it's about cross state licensure and making sure the therapists in one state can treat patients to another online for wheel which is a a tele medicine Staffing Company it was about ensuring that when California and other states tried to declare all sharing economy workers as full-time employees that nurses and nurse practitioners stayed out of that legislation uh and weren't part of it because that would have totally destroyed the business model so what we found is there's just so many different ways that we can play in the space so that's kind of become our our number one sector finac after that Transportation gaming and we can really do anything that is regulated but obviously the more and more we learn about a particular sector the more valuable our expertise becomes so I'm just curious to get your take well actually let's let's go metaphors you wrote a book called obvious and hindsight which is a satirical look at how capitalism politics and Entrepreneurship intersect give us a sense for what you think after spending so many years in politics what was now obvious and hindsight what I have found is people in the tech and Venture World fail to understand how people in politics and regulation think and people in politics and regulation fail to understand how people in Tech inventure think and and once you sort of understand the core motivations of each even if they're different then a lot of the decisions they make are actually obvious and predictable or more importantly in my real life of running the Venture fund uh things that we can influence and change right so this story is about a campaign to legalize flying cars in New York LA and Austin on one side is the flying car startup and their vicious political Consultants the other side is Uber and taxi United against it the Autobon Society the Socialists the trans unions and the Russian mob and it's a hysterical novel But ultimately it's really about um how of the politics the local level work where flying cars are clearly on their way to becoming a fan um but it's going to gore a lot of people's Ox right whether it's the Autobon Society worrying about sort of the destruction of birds in the sky or taxes worrying about the value of their medallions or trans unions worried about self self-flying cars and you know the book is really how does the startup and their Consultants navigate the process so they make the political process work for them and so they're able to convince the people they need that doing what they want is more likely to help them result in getting reelected because that's really all it ever comes down to in politics if a politic I thinks that you can either help them win their next election or you could cost them their next election which in reality is just the primary because of the gerrymandering they'll work with you and they'll do what you want and if they don't think you can have an impact on that you are completely irrelevant and so the book is really how do you how do you pull those levers of power so you you struck a chord there because I've always thought it enrages me that it takes me anywhere between 27 minutes and 2 hours to get to LaGuardia at some point in helicopters seems somewhat inefficient or strange loud dangerous the the VL space or whatever you call it it strikes me that someone's going to win there do you I'm just curious I know this's a bit of a digression who do you think or what are the Dynamics are it sounds like you think it's going to happen and who do you think will be the winners and losers yeah so I I I do think it's if now I think it's going to happen it is happening and I think in a lot of ways what EV tell is today are quiet helicopters right so the the challenge with helicopters from a political standpoint point is they're really loud and noisy and no one in Queens when you're trying to take your helicopter from wherever you are in Manhattan to LaGuardia or JFK wants it going over their house because helicopters aren't that high up in the sky uh eval the first e stands for electric so as a result it's silent so the first piece is you know is that enough um to make the politics work I think the answer is yes so Joby for example um is a company I don't have any investments in the space one way or the other but that did an event here in New York with mayor Adams a couple of months ago where he was touting in saying this is something the city would want to promote because we need ways to get people to the airports faster because building training to the plane hasn't worked and would cost tens of billions of dollars and if you could use evil instead um that would make a big difference so the first piece is can you get through the regulatory um on the FAA side they are issuing certifications that that that vehicles are flight worthy I is making progress on the local regulatory side the fight is just starting that's what the novel is about but I think we have seen politicians like Eric Adams embrace it um and then the other question becomes uh the time for you right so you're right that the trip to lardi is super variable you also know that you could take an Uber to Battery Park um and from from your apartment and then a blade to LaGuardia um but there's multiple segments there right so the reason I never do that is because I got to get the Uber to Berry part then I got to get out and wait for the blade then the blad's got got to take off me a time then land at LaGuardia then I got to get to my terminal it's kind of a pain in the ass why don't I just sort of I can if I get in a car in front of my apartment or my office I can just be on the call be on calls and work the whole way throughout and so I always land on that they've got to get the point of predictability where the friction is reduced enough that you and I say okay I'm going to have multiple moving Parts because I know it's only going to be 23 minutes guaranteed total as opposed to up to two hours um they're not at that yet it's funny because I'm living in London and I want to be supportive so I'm thinking about making some investments in startups and this is a not a startup but the company I've actually been looking at um and it's public publicly traded I think it's a broken spack but I I I just like the company is vertical Aerospace is this like a win or take all thing where there'll be one company that gets a contract from I don't know or gets an investment or Boeing or do you think there's going to be multiple wiers here no I mean first of all there there there's like I think over $8 billion it's already been invested in the space some of it from the strategics like Boeing or airb or whoever some of it from veter Capital who focus on this area um and there's different segments right so like uh you know there are some that just focus on cargo right there are some that are self-flying there are some that have Pilots there are some people that Envision a world like the Jetson where you just have your own self-flying car and hop in and drive you know and go from Pony to point B other people see it more like a bus um where there's a pickup and a drop off location so there's a lot of different competing Visions for it so I don't think it's win or take all and I think that we don't really know yet um which vision is going to win like when I think back at the early days when we did Uber we started off with with the black car service and it was successful but the market was somewhat limited it was only when we shifted to Uber X did the whole thing really explode but in the very very early days of uber Travis didn't know that that's the direction the business was going to go in right so I think people are going to try out all these different models and some of them are just going to work for consumers and some of them are not some are going to work politically some are not um but I think you have multiple winners so I appreciate you indulging me there let's get back to your BWI you were and are a player in politics give us your no mercy No Malice view of the election right now the handicap the presidential race what you think is going on and then more specifically I would just love to get your commentary on the most recent public flogging of the big Tech firms yeah sure so on the first one look I think that we may be entering a world of one- term presidents Governors Mayors because the public is fundamentally unhappy right so a few things one is social media I would argue is basically the unhappiness machine it does two things it forces you to compare your life to someone's fictional life so you feel inadequate immediately and then it shows you everything bad happening everywhere in the world all at once compounded by the views of a million idiots so you feel bit about bad about your own life you feel bad about yourself then the next step is existential risk so when you and I were kids there was one major exential risk which was nuclear war um that risk Still Remains it's probably worse right now because the proliferation of nukes is getting there and eventually Iran's going to have it North Korea has it but now you lay on top of that climate change uh the risk of a real serious pandemic I mean covid had a major impact but while it was highly transmissible it wasn't that lethal right but I am sure that a version of Co that is much more lethal exists in a lab in China or the us or Russia or Israel or the UK or somewhere or more likely all of them and so the risk of any of those getting out and then with AI like I'm a Believer in AI but none of it's too early for any of us to really know yet what it's going to be so the amount of existential risk has increased significantly and the third bucket would be a lot of the choices that we made in the 1990s which sort of the last time that we had a period of real kind of world peace and coordination um was to embrace you know free trade and globalization and the birth of the internet and globally that's worked really well billions of people are better off than they were 203 40 years ago where there's fewer people living in extreme poverty uh longer life expectancy lower infant mortality higher literacy rates all of those metrics but those tend to benefit the people who were the worst off to begin with and when you take a market that's closed and open it up then people who are succeeding in the Clos Market aren't going to do as well and a lot of those are Americans right so when Donald Trump does Maga America first kind of platform I don't really think that him saying or doing these things is going to change the under economics of anything but I understand the political appeal to it which is people who felt like a generation or two or three ago they were guaranteed a certain level income a certain lifestyle and now that no longer exists and then you layer in the opioid crisis terrible Public Schools wild expensive Health Care uh you know guns immigration everything else and like it is no surprise to me that people feel scared and upset and unhappy and every politician runs for office promising to fix all these problems and the problem is between low ver low voter turnout Jerry mandering dominant special interests and tons of extremism and polarization they can't really do anything so everyone fails all of the time the public gets angry they want blood so they hold the incumbent accountable and the incumbent loses so Trump was wter President Biden very well maybe as well and we may have five more of these until things right to ship so when can you say that Biden may very well be a one-term president I mean although I'm a moderate I think of myself as fairly sane which means I'm for Biden I know we're all supposed to understand and reach out to the other side I think to reelect an insurrectionist just makes no [ __ ] sense to me so the fact that someone who's much more in touch and quite frankly I think you're better regulating your emotions than I am sees that there's a decent chance that Trump will be reelected if you were advising the Biden campaign and for all intents and purposes maybe you are what do you think the message needs to be yeah so there's two things so the first question is I mean what what he should really do if his interest was the public good and not his own good and he's a politician which means his interest is his own good is not right right because when the election is a referendum on Trump which we not only saw in 2020 but we saw in the midterms in 2018 and 2022 Trump loses um there are more people that choose not to have him then have him but when the elections are referendum on both Trump and Biden the cumbent president in a time where people feel really unhappy then all of a sudden the math changes a lot and it gets a lot better for Trump so the best thing I would argue Biden could probably do is not run at all and you let like a total Cipher like a Gretchen Whitmer someone that just no one has any opinion on let them be the nominee because the point is you want to make the entire election just about Trump and nothing else do you still think there's I mean we we've all secretly hoped that I mean deep down I wish he'd picked what I would think is a VP that better resonates with the US and then stepped aside and said I'm going to go down in history as the greatest president ever best economy in the world more jobs created exponentially than anyone I saved you from this orange nightmare now I'm handing the reins over to Governor's Nome Whitmer is there still time for that two things so one is is there any human nature in history that would say this is possible the only real example I can ever point to is George Washington right otherwise everyone clings to power no matter what yeah so in a weird way I think the best thing the Democrats could do would be not to put a new person forward until the convention in July because you want the shortest general election possible because you want it to be just about Trump not about Trump and the Democratic nominee and so uh I actually think the less time the public has to get to know and and start to dislike the whoever the new person is the better off you are so you know at the convention Biden could step down and then there would be a giant fight what would be cool about it is the whole world would be be watching because it'd be like the first time since the 50s that a convention actually picked the nominee um America loves a winner and even now on our totally artificial conventions you still come out of it with a three or four point bounce for a little while and then you'd have a much shorter general election with a lot more attention being paid to it so I I think he could but I don't think he will right so then the question becomes what's the winning message for Biden and I'm an independent at this point so I if you think I hate your favorite party I do um but where Democrats keep getting wrong is they just keep insisting that if the people only knew about one more terrible thing Trump said or did then they would finally wake up and get it and nobody would vote for this guy and he would lose they get it when 47% of Voters are telling NBC news we prefer Trump over Biden compared to the 42% who are picking Biden they know every bad thing Trump's everever done they know he's been indicted on 91 different felony counts they know all the horrific things he said and they have still made the decision that in their mind their life was tangibly better off under Trump than it has been under Biden and therefore that's what they care about and what you've got to show those people is actually your life under Trump would be a lot worse so like for example if you take Trump's own advisors that they wored about their plans if if he were to win um dismantling the federal bureaucracy sounds great but what's use air travel we talking about that as an example if you cut the number of TSA agents in half that means the line is twice as long and if you cut the number of air traffic controllers in half that means ultimately the number of flights that that can run at any given time are only half as many which means flight to become more expensive and a lot less frequent you said to people okay uh if you'd like to spend now three or four hours at the airport because of Trump's changes and have to pay twice as much for your flight which now is only going to run every other day instead of every day then vote for Trump and I think that there are corollaries to that in almost every single sector where you've got to show people your real life is going to get worse in these very specific ways just taking this guy at his word for what he and his team say they're going to do if people feel like oh I don't want that and so I do think that there are tangible policy arguments you can make to people but people ultimately are voting on what's best for their pocketbook what's best for their family what's best for their life not for democracy as an institution and the left just never seems to understand that until you can pivot to a message of here's how your life would be worse uh I don't think they can win we'll be right back do you think ultimately the UN decided the only people that matter here generally speaking my view is they don't care about politics it was like me in my 20s and 30s I could give a [ __ ] about politics until the day before I voted and then I thought about it and went and voted if those people determine those 100,000 soccer moms and those five states whatever it is don't you think at the end of the day and again I'm talking my own book here don't you think at the end of the day they go you know the economy maybe maybe it's not as good as their claiming but it's not bad so I I hope so and by the way it that number can be as small as 45,000 soccer bombs um so we're really talking about six states and maybe 30 counties total that that matter here um look before Trump no US president who was governing over presiding over a good economy and we were not engaged in a ground war with our own troops ever lost re-election and then Trump now Co obviously made everything even especially weird but the economy had generally been pretty good we weren't at a ground war with anyone and yet he lost because he's Trump right and so the I I think the script has just been flipped and people's unhappiness now kind of overrides everything else and you're right there's a cognitive dissonance where all the economic metrics on job growth and the stock market and even inflation now don't line up with how people feel I mean consumer spending is tremendous despite the fact that people tell posters that they feel bad about the economy so the hope is that those views start to rebound but the reality is the main metric people people seem to vote on is inflation and the real thing there is gas prices and food prices um and those two are still a lot of risk I mean every time the hoties send up a missile and take down a tanker you know gas prices go up and so um I'm not sure that's going to fix itself in time for the election and I just think generally speaking we're in this era where things feel so bad um that even if they're not that bad like take I don't you know you're you're in London most of the time now but like New York City the actual crime metrics are not that bad if if you compare crime for the last couple years it's it's safe however we live in a world where there's 5,000 illegal wheat shops that are just allowed to operate and that just makes it feel Lawless like who's in charge here there's scaffolding on every block that no one ever bothers to to remove uh there are junkies whacked out on trap falling asleep on the street every time you go to CVS get a t of toothpaste you now have to get someone to unlock a case from you and so it feels bad the city feels unsafe Eric Adams our mayor is at a 28% % approval rating in the latest quiny Pak poll that's the lowest recorded approval rating of any mayor in New York City history and the reason isn't because the city is substant that bad it's because the perception is bad um and and that's reflecting how people feel so I want to I'm going to ask you about your your 50 reflections of 50 but first just to wrap up on politics whenever I go to Washington I'm actually I'm I actually end up feeling better about America strangely enough I I meet with senators and Congress people and on both sides of the A and I generally find that they're either very good actors or they seem like smart people trying to do the right thing and you know really impressed the Senators Warner kashar Bennett people who just strike me as moderates and smart and are trying to do um the right thing Senator Blackburn who I'm not a fan of I think she's trying to do the right thing on social media I don't I I look at Senators Cruz and Graham and I think they're just total [ __ ] [ __ ] pretending to give a [ __ ] anyway the give us some hope here what politicians would you want to bring some sunlight to that you think are willing to risk re-election to try and do the right thing so the risk of cism first of all the three people you named Minnesota Virginia Colorado those are all effectively purple swing States yeah moderates right so as a result they have the freedom to be reasonable because they're less Hostage to the crazies uh in in their party look uh as you know I was Mike Bloomberg's campaign manager for mayor of New York um Mike at this point is is too old ter for president but in my view he would have been the ideal person and he's the only politician I've ever worked with in my life that genuinely said and it helps when you have all the money that he has but nonetheless genuinely said every decision is based on what I truly believe is best for the city and you could disagree with his assessment of something but it was truly how he decided absolutely everything yeah if not I'll go back to my life of private jets and same Parts I'm going to be just fine I don't have a I don't have any trouble getting reservations in restaurants without without thetic title right or where anything else so um you know there are some people like that who are exceptions to the rule but or I'll my now pure nepotism my brother-in-law Josh gottheimer is a member of Congress he's from New Jersey uh he happens to be one of the remaining 2530 swing districts he is the chairman and founder of the problem solvers caucus which is a bipartisan group that actually does try to get [ __ ] done um Josh is what we should absolutely want and Josh is actually on bills like infrastructure and cops uh you know he's actually helped move some stuff forward in a meaningful way but Josh to you know has the luxury of representing a swing District he had to beat a seven-term republican to win the seat but once he did you know yes he gets a crazy primary from the farle every time but in his district the the concern of them winning is low enough that Josh can ignore that and just focus on who would you like to see President and it can't be someone related to you um I mean I think of of the PE to me of the people who are at least talked about right now Whitmer probably is the combination I don't even know her personally at all of someone who seems well qualified has a good record in Michigan and also is a cipher because again as we discussed you want to make the election solely a referendum on Trump so Gavin Nome has done some really good things I mean the stuff he did around housing and and actually kind of making it possible to build in California I think was was excellent but um can you paint him as the typical California liberal smug whatever it is you could so arguably the election becomes more about him so the more it's about someone that everyone's like yeah fine which by the way that was Biden in 20 nobody had any opinion but everyone's opinion B was like yeah fine what whatever I I think Nome and you is his campaign manager president of the fifth largest state most Nobel Prize winners reelected with 62% or that recall vote he got 62% my sense is and I want to get your response to this that this is all about contrast cuz you're right everybody hates the incumbent you put Nikki Haley on the on the on the stage next to Biden I think she she kills him in an election and I think you put I think you put Nome quite frankly it's this youth versus tired tired old people you put new some more Whitmer on the stage with Trump and people look at Trump angry and breathing hard and uh looking like he's going to have a stroke when he's injecting himself with a GOI and they go you know I think I'm going to go with that Whitmer It just strikes me that the parties would be so much smarter to put up someone under the age of a hundred yeah but but again this gets back to the underlying point of our conversation which is behavioral in input shaped policy outputs right whether it's economic or political who are the people at the parties they are the people who stand to gain the most if Trump or Biden are the President right they lobbying firms they friends they're everything it's not there are these independent mechanisms that to say we just want to do what's best for the party and the country and we don't care about what the person at the top of our ticket wants they are totally dependent on that person if Trump doesn't want Ron McDaniel to be the chairman of the RNC she's not going to be the chair of the RNC right and so fundamentally yes you're right but you know this is why I kind of keep pushing mobile voting which is we all keep banging our heads against the wall and saying why can't they be better right and the answer is they're not cap of it the kind of people who run for office are desperately self-loathing insecure people who can't live out the validation of holding office and they're never going to pick the public good over their own personal good and that's true throughout politics which is why you can't ever get better people what you can get are better incentives where you align the things that we want to see happen from a policy standpoint with the with the Pol underlying politics so it actually makes sense for do that's why people that you cited like kachar and Bennett and and Warner they can actually get away with that right you know you got to Aline inputs and outputs and if you don't do that you know all of the frustration and outrage in the world isn't going to change it so just to wrap up here on a more positive note for your 50th birthday and I love this you published a list of 50 Reflections can you distill them down to your top three pieces of Life advice yeah sure uh and by the way a lot of it is you know lessons that I've learned the hard way over the years and you can find it on medium if you're interested um look I've spent a ton of time studying happiness side and behavioral economics and behavioral psychology and fundamentally this is the way I see it I don't believe in reincarnation I don't believe in an afterlife this is the one shot I've got here and it's going to be at most a 100 years which is a blip of time in a 5 billion year old Earth and nobody owes me anything it is my responsibility to make the most of my life that I possibly can so number one is you got to be proactive you got to make [ __ ] happen you got to take risk um you got to put your yourself out there you have to be willing to fail and I fail all the time because you can't succeed if you're never failing you're not taking nearly enough risk in the first place so the first thing is you can't expect anyone to do it for you it's on you but the second thing is we do have kind of a warped view in this Society in this country as to what produces happiness right so what at least all of the data says is two things produce happiness relationships and fulfillment there are people in your life that you really count on and and you know they're going to be there for you support you no matter what and vice versa that really matters and if you do things that you find fulfilling and that doesn't have to mean working a soup kit and just things that are intellectually engaging and fulfilling for you uh you know make you feel good about the work that you're doing in some way whatever it is that could be through your work it could be through your hobbies your faith whatever it is um if you have those two things in your life you're going to be happy uh you know the grant study that Harvard did Grand study of course yeah so like just for the listeners basically Harvard took a group of of sophomore uh sophomores in like 1934 4 I think or 38 and then a group of working-class young men and Boston the same age followed them over their entire lives studied them met with them constantly and then said who was happy and why and it was the people who had really good relationships and had a job that made them feel good about themselves you have to figure out the highest Roi for yourself and despite what sort of Instagram tells you it's not really status and wealth uh those are good things to have for sure but it's really relationships and fulfillment and so if you can construct your life as much as possible around trying to maximize for relationships and fulfillment from a purely selfish standpoint that will generate the most happiness the best life for you so if that really to me that whole
