we talked a little bit about um sampling versus specializing I remember vividly um I think it was like the Headmaster one of these Elite schools it may or may not have been where Bill Gates went to school and it may or may not have been the you know principal or head of the school that he attended while he was attending it but I remember what he said which is that when he looked at the parents of the kids who ended up being very successful you know the parents were watching their kids like Hawks for what sparked their kids interest and I know it sounds like a like kind of like a you know soft or hookie thing but like you know what if your kids's not interested in something they're not going to be great at it and so looking for those I I think looking for flickers of interest is more important than looking at flickers of [Music] talent Professor Duckworth where does this podcast find you it finds me at my office at the University of Pennsylvania okay so let's bust right into it your research focuses on two traits that predict achievement grit and self-control can you break these down for us I think self-control and grit are members of the same family call them cousins if you want maybe even siblings um but they're not the same thing so so the family is really the psychology of effort I mean these are two traits that describe people who put forth effort toward goals grit which I'm probably a little better known for is about expending effort toward varying distant goals so goals that might take years or even a lifetime to accomplish uh self-control is also about effort but these are goals that are kind of everyday goals like I have to floss my teeth I should go to bed instead of scrolling through Twitter you know I I should really get my taxes filed before April 15th so self-control and grit are related because they're both about effort toward your goals but I think grit is actually driven by having a kind of passion um and and resilience and self-control you know we could talk more about it but it's it's it's like delay of gratification ability to resist Temptations in the moment I just had a question from a guy who's a former Green Beret and when I think of grit I think that the armed services are very good at instilling grit in people um one do you agree with that or two how do you reverse engineer to the fundamentals of building grit I think the military is good at developing and probably so you know when you talk about the Green Beret or the seals um or the Rangers um Special Forces also for selecting of for grit I don't want say anything that you or I ever talk about is without genetic influence but I also can't think of anything you and I talk about that is entirely fixed um and if it's not just you know genetic Destiny then the question is you know what are the environmental influences and and Scott you you've got me now exactly what I'm thinking about these days and I'm not going to tell you that I have it all figured out but I've been obsessed would be one way to think about it is like what are the environments that enable people to a Express the grit they already have and B develop more grit than they had before um so I just want to answer succinctly and say like absolutely I think it's possible then you know you and I can you know talk about um you know my ideas your ideas about about what specific environments those are I think I'm curious if you and literally just thought of this but I'll throw this thesis at you that what would help to understand or be a different dimension on git or helping to understand it is what is the opposite of it and I think the opposite of it is being entitlement a belief that things are going to come to you easy or you give up easily or you get frustrated when your problems aren't solved thoughts you know when you said um thinking about the opposite well the first word that came to my mind was not entitlement it was dilatant um and and by the way TL sto is right that you know every family H happy family is alike but every unhappy family is unhappy in their own way then you know maybe gritty people are like but did not have grit takes different forms I've thought about that quote a lot maybe not necessarily in the context of grit and I I do think TL sto was right and I would answer your question this way I don't think there's one opposite of grit I think entitlement might be one way to not be gritty I think being a zilon is not the same and I think that's another way so so the ful answer is like what is it that makes gritty people gritty and then the absence of those things if there are a plurality of assets that make gritty then then all of those are ways not to be gritty um and and I absolutely have thoughts on that I mean just um to give you you know an elaboration of my example about dilatant and I know that word has negative connotations um but but I will say this to be gritty is to be obsessive about something you know you wake up and you're thinking about it again and you wake up and you think about it again and you know to you it's exhilarating to other people it's exhausting and so one asset that you have to have to be passionate about something for your whole well for your whole life in the extreme but for years is a kind of um you know like a kind of devotion right and and that's why I think one of the first things that leaps to my mind as not being gritty is to be somebody who you know as soon as the learning curve starts to Plateau a bit right it's not you know pure novelty you know you're sort of like wandering off to a different learning curve so again I you know forgive me the the bajard of connotations I think it's actually a completely legitimate way to lead your life I know people I like a lot who are the opposite of obsessive they don't want to get deep and I think that's actually morally just as good as somebody who has this tendency to want to get deeper and deeper and deeper and more and more Nuance but generally speaking they're not as successful right I mean what I like about your work is it's not when when I first read your book it's it felt to me like I'm not going to talk about the way the world should be but what it is I yeah I know Scott I have my my critics and by the way um I I I don't I don't necessarily disagree with the criticism but I will stand firm at least for myself on this I think people who are world-class Achievers I think to a one they have grit uh and I think this um last element that we're talking about this like obsessiveness oh my gosh you know call it confirmation bias but holy smokes I see it all the time I interview somebody who you knows that they're making their way in the stand-up comedy world I mean I'll just give you my last conversational example is um talking this guy named Gary Simons and he's a standup comic he's 25 graduated from Georgetown he's um you know he's making it right and and just this conversation I'm like oh yeah that's grit like you know his oh he are the Google Docs from the people that I interviewed you know how'd you find them well I went to the Georgetown you fellowships office and I looked up alumni who might have something to do with this you know crazy career that I want to do and here all the times I DMD Mike biglia and you know he finally wrote me back and then so funny I was just thinking of Mike he's on open mic night all the time he just texted me the guy will text me individually he cuz I like think he likes me but he wants to spread he is literally hand toand combat and I think that's what people Miss is to get I would say after working my ass off for 30 years I'm an overnight success I don't think young people appreciate Beyonce has Einstein they all had amazing everyone right Beyonce Einstein Mike biglia you know Mike berbiglia's prote uh I think I'm right about that right and then the question is like what are the multiple assets because your question is very revealing what is the opposite of grit I think there multiple opposites and uh say you are that person with kind of um a tendency to get obsessively interested in something to stay loyal to it and to want to want to come back to it that's only one thing like you know that's not the same thing as resilience in the in the face of setbacks okay well that's another way to not be gritty right because if you don't have that we can we can unpack the psychology of that but I think one of my advisers in um my undergraduate years is a very famous Professor now past named Jerry Kagan and I remember that when I kind of grew up and became a psychologist like him you know we had a very brief conversation about grit and he was like H it's too many things like it's unwieldy because it's too many things but I think when you look at very successful people they do have this like composite quality um of passion and perseverance and the elements of those two as well I I agree I know a lot of talented people Talent is sort of you know table step but the thing that that sends you into outer space or puts you in the top 10 or 1% is you know the willingness to break through hard things going you know I'm I'm fond of saying success is in the last 10% the people who just go the extra mile what do you see in high school students in terms of background or any observations anything that you can reverse engineer to someone who's likely going to develop grit and other components and be a quote unquote superachiever so let's break grit down to to it's you know two um you know it's two facets so there's passion and perseverance CU when you talk about young people I think it's important to distinguish those I mean it's important for all of us but let's take perseverance first so yeah I mean there are high school students who are you know clearly uh much harder working and much um you know much more resilient than others I think that's something which continues to develop but uh you can see it it's often in sports honestly it's um you know there are other ways in which you can develop and express this quality but I can't tell you how biased I am toward Varsity athletes it's like 100% give me a fouryear varsity athlete let's go like um so you can see that at at 17 or 16 so that's perseverance and again we can we can unpack that I do think the elements of of a of a really persevering young person or older person like I think to some some extent you can reverse engineer those qualities you're like wow they're they're such Optimist where does that come from you know what are their beliefs and so forth but let me also say that there's another half of grit that is not as obvious from the word grit and that is passion and when I say passion I really do mean a kind of intrinsic desire an intrinsic interest in what you're doing and the reason I like bringing up the uh you know hypothetical high school student is there's a there's a paradox uh for passion which is this I think at your age my age you know this specialization that we have you know everything connects in some way to what we are interested in so we are hyp specialized we might cross fertilize but there's a center of gravity that's what we look like when we're all grown up but when you're 16 or 15 or 14 you know you're in a entirely different developmental stage I don't think it's healthy or even on the road to to be obsessively narrowly focused on one thing when you're a teenager I think actually the data would suggest and this is actually research from other scientists not mine that paradoxically what leads to to specialization is sampling it's the opposite it's kind of you know Rowdy gains doing like a half dozen Sports before he decides to become a swimmer right and and sports which we were just talking about is one of the fields in which this has been best documented that athletes who become world class are more likely to have sampled broadly in their youth than than prematurely specializing so I'm always careful or I try to be when I talk about grit with young people because I don't want them to think that butterflies started out like little butterflies you know butterflies started out as caterpillars so we should have disclosed at the beginning of the show that this podcast is basically a vehicle for me just to talk about myself so be be forar but I'm going to give you three examples my mother said that when anyone's talking to anyone they're always talking to them and I think 100% um but I I think a lot about grit and I I just think it's hard to argue with and what's interesting is I think the most insightful books and work is people State the obvious but they hadn't thought about it and your book was sort of everyone said well of course it is but no one really no one really kind of explored it my life was grit growing up I was an underachiever lazy just kind of sleep walking through oh yeah just totally sleep walking through life and there were three things that I think gave me what I believe is a great deal of grit the first is uh my mom got very sick and it was very shocking at a young age to be faced with that kind of illness and I remember thinking there's no way I don't know how to handle this I can never get through this and do oh I was I was in graduate school so it wasn't it wasn't like it happened when I was a kid that actually happened last but just emotional fortitude realizing that life is tough and you get through it um that just that confidence gave me a little bit more I don't know courage or resilient whatever the term is but the two other things were in college I rode crew and you would I was I was a varsity athlete and in at one point in a race you you wouldn't be able to fill your legs it'd be like fire going down your esophagus you would have these mental tricks to try and not pass out and that was at 800 M and you would go 2,000 and it gave you this sense of when you think you're at your limit emotionally physically psychologically when you really think you're at your limit you think I can never I just can't take anymore that means you're about a third of the way there and most people never are in a position to really push their limits they never develop that they never really test the boundaries of their limits and then the assume the boundaries right is that's right and they think they're much tighter than they actually are and then the other thing was at Morgan Stanley there was such an intolerance for mediocrity you could be fired if there was a typo in the memo you sent out 18 hours a day you abusive work culture given a clean white shirt if you did it all nighter so there was all this this kind of cultural pressure to work around the clock a massive amount of pre pressure on Perfection and an intense borderline abusive work environment gave me those kind of three legs of a stool of of grit do you think do you see those as common or common attributes in people who develop a certain level or common shared experiences and people who've who've who demonstrate grit well I have a hypothesis and I think you named half of it I think grit is forged in a crucible half of which is challenge I mean what what is challenge challenge is being asked to do something you cannot yet do right you know 2,000 meters instead of 800 like whatever it is right I can't do it the challenges exceed my resources or my abilities so I think that is half of it but you know when n said what doesn't kill me makes me stronger I mean it does make you wonder like well you look around and it does actually kill or or seriously wound uh you know a lot of people and I think that's because the other half of The Crucible and and you can agree or disagree with me is some kind of support like where does that inner selft talk come from that says you know I'll show you right because I think if there was one phrase that I have heard over and over again in interviews of the grittiest people it's that when they describe confronting a major challenge especially when they're doubted right and and someone else tells them like well you can't do this you know there is this rage this like voice that says I'll show you and my theory is that being in one challenging situation after another is not enough to give you the voice that says I'll show you somewhere there has to be support somewhere there has to be a you know like I can't remember Rocky's coach like the guy with the you know just Meredith exactly right like the Sailor you know like the beanie on or like I think I've seen it too often you know that people who are in challenging situations without support you know are not the ones to get up again dust themselves off like learn something you know come back stronger than they were before so so H how do you like that hypothesis that the cruci grit is is a challenge plus support and you could argue that people aren't getting them in the right doses or neither but you know I think those are Elemental I love that I one of my favorite saying is that always stuck with me one of my venture capitalist again I'm Larry bond from General Catalyst I I said greatness is in the agency of others and hearing you speaking my grid is in the agency of others that I love that can you tell me more about that expression which I've only heard for the first time from your lips well greatness is in the agency of others you you I mean think about think about the platform you're at at pen right would you have nearly the impact you're having without great research Associates Great colleagues all the people who come before you at pen your publisher probably not your publisher I I found they almost do nothing but anyways but my husband how that whatever your you know your colleagues that support you the person proof reading your book the person doing the research that the people generally I find greatness or people they have to have their own grit they have to demonstrate grit but what that does is it inspires the people around them to do great work for them you can't people think Malcolm Gladwell is in his kitchen like doing these videos and everything he's got a team of like dozens of really talented people and producers 100% you know Scott I only learned very recently from um friends who are authors who shall remain nameless because I didn't know this and I don't know that they'd be uh wanting to keep it a secret but it was a secret for me that writers that I really respected have you know like a Cadre of people like oh I don't just have like this editor who assigned to me by my publisher like I sent it out to this person and that person and you know like conceptual stuff and uh you know what's on my mind you know recently is you know how that feels like anti-heroic in a way like there's something about DIY that is like that's the way to go like you're supposed to be a solo performer and if you need anybody else's assistance then like you know there's like 100 grit points and like if they get 20 you only get 80 right um and and now when I'm interviewing people who are really successful and gritty I'm hearing and maybe it's cuz I'm looking for it Scott like so maybe I'm you know hunting for for for what I'm looking for but but what I'm hearing are people who are virtuoso at actually getting like their environments to be their Ally um and not their opponent so they will take anything you know it's like any Edge for it's it's not cheating for them to use their situations to their own Advantage we'll be right back Professor do you have children I have two they are 23 and 21 how did this work impact your approach to raising kids when I started graduate school I was pregnant with Lucy and I think I was still nursing Amanda so I was becoming a mom at the same time as I was becoming a psychologist and because I really didn't know anything about psychology I really was starting from scratch right I wasn't a Psychology major I majored in neurobiology I had a master's in Neuroscience but it was really a very different thing so I was learning about everything P for the first I mean everything and then I would come home and turn the key in the lock and then I would walk over the threshold and I would be a mom and not a psychology student but of course it was all the same me and so I feel like my study of self-control and of grit and of effort uh and um you know the foil for those things which are you know um whatever it is to be innately talented or um naturally intelligent I mean it was just all in my head and I think how it influenced my parenting and I should say our parenting because my husband Jason and I were um you know talking every night about like what we were what I was learning as a as a researcher I mean I did raise them to believe that Excellence comes from you know pick your favorite quote but let's take wooden the UCLA basketball coach right who said uh there are eight laws of learning explanation demonstration uh imitation uh get the repetition oh and then the last ones are easy repetition repetition repetition repetition so five of the eight right are the same so so I did raise them to not think of Excellence as a magic trick you know they're 23 and 21 so they're still sampling but I will say I think I think they you know drank the Kool-Aid so to speak do you think I I'll start with a thesis I coach a lot of young men my general and there is some research here that while physically stronger boys are emotionally and psychologically weaker than girls if they're raised in a single parent household they're much less likely their outcomes are worse when they lose a male role model whereas when girls are in go from Dual parent to single parent homes they have similar outcomes they're more resilient have you found any research that finds that young women are more resilient or demonstrate more grit than young men I had a uh female neurosurgeon um approach me and it's been a few years so I can't remember um much about the interaction except for that she had a hypothesis she said you know there aren't many of us meaning female neurosurgeons in fact they apparently if I if I recall correctly which I may not because it's been a few years like they have a number because they're so few that like you know it's like a Deli you know you get you get the next number I don't know what number she was 125 or whatever she was um and she said I just can't believe that that uh there's equal grit among the female and the male neurosurgeons in part just because of selection right it's like a fine mesh Civ and we're still here um so we did do a little study we um or she I should say you know I just gave her the grit scale the grit scale is a 12 item questionnaire and has very obvious items you know setbacks don't discourage me um I finish whatever I begin it's got passion items about having consistency in a in a in a in a goal for very long periods of time and when the data came back I'll tell you you know she did not find a statistically significant gender difference I think favoring either side honestly um now that doesn't mean there aren't any there are lots of you know boring uh aspects of self-report questionnaires that we can talk about one of them though that's very relevant to looking at gender differences is uh something I studied it's called reference bias so Scott if you take a questionnaire and I take a questionnaire and we read the same item I am a hard worker you first conjure up an image of a hard worker and then you measure yourself to that standard one of the things that I think May obscure gender differences is that if that person has higher standards then you have two forces that are working in opposition on one hand they may really be grittier on the other hand their higher standard is going to yield a lower score and uh this has absolutely been documented in cross-cultural research so in one study there are over I think 60 countries and it wasn't a grit scale but it was a measure of overall conscientiousness right big five conscientiousness you know being orderly and responsible and I you know imagine like you know detail oriented but also by the way this is the family that includes grit and self-control so that family and they gave it to people in all these different countries and then the very simple question was like what are the most conscientious countries in the world and when the data came in it was fairly shocking because whereas the you know leaders were not especially clear but what I remember from the paper was that the losers were so the lowest conscientious countries were I think Japan like South Korea like maybe China I mean these countries that stereotypically you're like really like really and what I believe and I think what the author of This research report also believe is that what you're really revealing there are standards right it's it's it's probably that you know the same words are on the paper but they're essentially answering different questionnaires so on gender I have not found reliable gender differences in grit I don't you know I don't know whether there really are um but but I will say this I think um I have to be careful because I think I'm actually biased towards women so I'm I'm aware of that um you know I I will say there is a gender difference that we haven't talked about that goes against your hypothesis um and I'll say these are um data that come from like giving women tasks like an IQ test and Men um the same IQ test there are differences in confidence there are differences in you know like okay you just took this test Scott what do you think you did like how do you think how oh I think I did great right women with the same score will be like oh you know terribly right so I think there are es and confidence that uh are not um necessarily Justified but also would work against your hypothesis you have a new book you've been writing on the power of the situation you say that the entire book can be summarized with this sentence achieving your goals is easier when you make your situation your ally that feels very obvious putting yourself in the right room the right context the right platform say more about that do Mo do some people not recognize the importance of the context or the situation I think there are you know two reasons why people do not recognize the power of the situation um one is you know Victor frankl's you know the message that people heard from maner for meaning that some people heard is that well unfortunately you cannot change your circumstances but you can change how you respond to them you know I don't think that's actually what Victor Frankle meant I mean I don't think Victor Franco was like so what their concentration camps and Nazis and you know our entire people are being extinguished what really matters is our attitude because we have to control the controllables so I think there's a a kind of misunderstanding I think many circumstances are given but not all and I think that impediment that kind of like oh you got to control the controllables meaning yourself and you know this list of things that you can't control gets rounded up to be everything right so so I think I think people do Overlook the situation in part because they assume it's a given uh and the second reason is that even when you can control your situ let's take OIC as as one very controversial example right um I think there are people who would consider taking OIC for weight loss to be a form of weakness um you know sort of um you know kind of um well if you were stronger if you you know were just more disciplined if you dot dot dot well then you wouldn't need to rely on this crutch right people think like using chat gbt is cheating right and I know you can actually cheat with chat gbt but these are just two features of your your situation that you could use to your advantage or not use to your advantage so the second reason I think we Overlook the power of the situation is that it feels like cheating when the situation is helping us and the Very cover of grit which I don't even know if I have back here but anyway on this bookshelf there might be a copy of grit and if I pulled it out you know it's this one big Arrow going to the right against these little arrows that go to the left and the idea of grit I think is about overcoming you know overcoming aspects of your situation for sure but I think what that uh leaves out it's not that this book is a correction but I do think it's a completion of the idea is that it's great to have a big arrow pointing to the right it's great to work hard it's great to pick yourself up and be resilient but why not do that in a river that's flowing in your direction last question here two or three pieces of advice to parents who recognize the importance of grit and want to do what they can to try and instill a sense of grit putting their kids in the right context or situation to be successful like if you tried to distill it down and every book on parenting I read just kind of says to me no one has any idea every book I read seems to contradict the one before it but could you are there two or three things that you would say are kind of tried and true in terms of helping your kids establish this fantastic competence you know I think every kid uh benefits from having a a kind of surrogate par parent at a certain point often in their teen years sometimes younger and what I mean by that is you know their track coach you know their their violin teacher you know the the AP History teacher who really pushed them um and why are these surrogate parents so like I don't know essential even is is one word that listen to them well exactly because we are rejecting the actual parents that we have and and these um you know I watched it with my own kids like you know you got to Outsource some of this parents because you know uh there's almost nothing you can do this one day my daughter comes home from like track practice and she was like oh you got to get bed early I need to drink water like you know I can't be eating all this crap and I was like like like what I've been saying all these things especially on the sleep and and it's like oh because our track coach told her right so I think one thing is outsourcing some of the modeling um and I think that does come through extracurricular activities almost always right uh and I guess the you know the second thing is you know we talked a little bit about um sampling versus specializing I remember vividly um I think it was like the Headmaster of one of these Elite schools it may or may not have been where Bill Gates went to school and it may or may not have been the you know principal or head of the school that he attended while he was attending it but I remember what he said which is that when he looked at the parents of the kids who ended up being very successful you know the parents were watching their kids like Hawks for what sparked their kids interest um and I know it sounds sounds like like kind of like a you know soft or hookie thing but like you know what if your kids's not interested in something they're not going to be great at it and so looking for those I I think looking for flickers of interest is more important than looking at flickers of talent right not just like what seems to come easily to your kid but what holds their attention you know those are the seeds of passion so I lied one final final question what can kill grit what do you need to avoid what can get you stuck or reduce the levels of grit well we talked about the the situation we you know don't have a whole conversation on burnouts but I do think there's a there's a Nuance here like if you just look at correlations between grit and burnout the grittier people are are less burned out that's honestly not shocking but I think really gritty people are in some ways at the highest risk of burnout because Slackers don't get burnt out and gritty people work so hard and they are so tenacious so what imp girl's grit I think when you asked about you know you know what are the environments The Crucible I said like I'm listening to your story I hear a lot of challenge I'm guessing that there's another through line of support somewhere in there or Scott wouldn't become Scott so I think burnout is what happens when you try really really hard in a very gritty way probably um and and somehow things are just not working for you and and when that happens I think looking outside of yourself instead of inside yourself looking at what could make it easier to accomplish your goals as opposed to berating yourself for not trying harder honestly Scott that's what I'm trying to do yeah forgive yourself Angela Duckworth is a psychologist the co-founder of character lab and a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania she's also the author of the number one New York Times bestseller grit the power of passion and perseverance she joins us from her office at the great educational institution in the University of Pennsylvania Professor you own you literally own a character attribute that is such good for you well done oh it's not patented you know when when the Flyers uh named their the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team when they named their mascot gritty uh no royalties were exchanged nor should they have been yeah but more importantly yeah when people say to your kids who is your mom my mom was the grit woman there's just a lot worse things you could say about people congratulations on your success SAU thank you Scott
