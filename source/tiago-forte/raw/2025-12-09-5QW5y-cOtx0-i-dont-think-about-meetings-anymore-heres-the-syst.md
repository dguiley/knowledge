# I Dont Think About Meetings Anymore Heres the System

Published: 2025-12-09

[Music] Aiden. Hey. >> Hey, what's up? >> Feeling pretty overwhelmed trying to finish my book here in the next few weeks. And I was thinking, do you want to create a a video for my YouTube channel while I'm away? >> Yeah, for sure. >> I was thinking of that cool AI workflow that you showed me that you use for meetings where everything just happens automatically. What do you think? >> Sure thing. I was actually updating it. So, it's perfect timing. Let's do this. >> So, one thing to keep in mind, uh, is that the workflow I'm about to share, you know, while it's currently utilized in a business context, in my opinion, is useful to probably anybody who's watching this and does any form of knowledge work whatsoever. So, I originally did this for a specific, you know, sales function in my business, but it would also apply equally to recruiting functions and analyzing calls with candidates. It would apply to uh training calls. It would apply to, you know, one-on-one calls with your team. It would apply to huddles and leadership team calls. It would also apply to, you know, potentially things that are not calls but are still recordings of transcripts. So, for example, if you're studying something, you know, that's in a video format, it could do the same thing. Uh I think the key to this is understanding that the if you break this down from first principles what we're actually looking at is we have a trigger which is analyzing a transcript that kicks off a series of events one of which is using AI prompts to analyze that transcript and do all sorts of automations. So I I would encourage you the viewer to be creative in how this might apply to you just understanding that if it can create a transcript you can create a workflow. So, Zapier is the workflow tool that I'm using and the reason I use Zapier is it just integrates with absolutely everything. If I'm teaching others about it, Zapier can almost definitely integrate with whatever they're doing. It's also very cheap and it's also quite simple. When you start, you have to add a trigger. What's the trigger that kind of kicks off the process to begin? And in this case, it's a screen recorder. We use Bubbles, not because Bubbles is good or because I recommend it, but we've been using it for years and we just never moved away from it. Bubbles has a simple integration with Zapier. Basically, the first step is it's analyzing uh looking into our Bubbles account for a a new recording. And then once it finds that recording, it's then looking into Google calendar to find an event that matches the name of that recording. Then we're basically filtering on Zapier. Then it goes out and it creates the audio recording and uploads it to the Google Drive. Then it creates a new Google doc of the transcript of that recording. Then it goes and analyzes that transcript with a prompt. based on that gives outputs based on that prompt based on what we want to see. It then takes those outputs and adds it as a spreadsheet row to a Google sheet. It then updates on Slack and sends to everyone within that channel and update with all all those items. I'm in the channel too. Um then we use ClickUp internally and it updates ClickUp reporting and it also updates reporting for the customer on their version of ClickUp. And so it's a 10step thing using I guess five different external tools because I didn't create this and because it's tied to Andy's account. So I actually asked him to record himself building it from scratch. Why don't we look into the details of of each step? The first step and this is you know every zap needs to kick off with the trigger, right? What what actually starts it. In this case it is just using bubbles. It could be any of of the otter or whatever um notetakers. It's looking for a specific title and a specific sort of embed code. So the second step is it then looks at Google calendar and it looks at Andy's account, Andy's calendar because again Andy's been invited to all of these calls automatically. You can now take the outputs of previous steps as inputs, right? And so in this case in step one, we had an output which was exactly what we just looked at which was this bubbles title. And so we're now using that as an input and we're searching for that. So what we've now done is we said okay we've triggered the event with the bubble and then we found a way to actually find the event in Google calendar. Okay so the next step was a filter that we set up through Zapier and basically essentially looking for the right call and so in this case this is an onboarding call that we're doing for a specific product that we sell called the accelerator. So it's making sure that the matched item in the Google calendar is the right call. That's all. After that it is creating a file. In this case, we're creating a file from text using Google Drive. Again, we're looking at the the same outputs from previous steps as inputs into this step. And we're basically saying, okay, we're going to take the same title in the bubbles and we're going to grab the actual content um that was transcripted. And then we're going to load it into this particular um folder in Google Drive. Next step, step five is to basically create the Google doc right here. So that's the transcript and the previous file we looked at um was the actual video. All right. So the next step is it's kind of the key step. So it's using GPT5 Mini and basically it's using as inputs again we're using the text content. So that file that was just made as an input and we're also figuring out who was who were the attendees and then we're putting in a prompt and so Andy just used you know worked with Claude to create a good prompt around it. But it's basically it says please conduct a comprehensive analysis of the provided transcript focus specifically on the following business process related topics for topics one to five return a value yes or no based on the criteria described below. So for these this is just saying yes or no right it's like a checklist did Nathan in this case do all five of these things. Zapier helps you by giving you a preview output. Um you can just click the generate preview button and you can see what it's actually going to output. Um so the name email address clearly this thing works. The prompt here is really important. The prompt is kind of what makes this what allows you to use this kind of for anything. I mean really anything that involves a transcript and the analysis of that transcript. And that transcript doesn't have to come from a video, right? It can come from notes. It can come from all sorts of all sorts of places. It would actually be to figure out like what is the desired behavior change you want. In this case, the desired behavior change for me was just ensuring um a that we mentioned all of the things that are coming up so that nobody feels no customer in the future feels like they they didn't understand the entire process and most importantly that there's an actual scheduled follow-up call. That was the behavior I just and and again this was more of like a simpler one. In a sales one, the behavior might be to ask for the sale or the behavior might be to sit in the pain or the behavior might be to, you know, shut up and let other people talk. Those are all interesting options. Uh, in some cases, it's it's not necessarily behavior modification or behav. So, again, in sales, what we've done in our automation is it automatically does all the follow-ups, puts it into Salesforce, which is what we use. It automatically takes all the notes for us and it automatically updates our reporting. So all of those things together combined probably took a salesperson about maybe an hour and a half a day in total which is you know probably 20% of their time. By removing that we've removed the errors that inevitably occur. We're able to take 20% more calls right which is 20% more sales. And we've also removed the reporting component from from management. and reporting no longer needs to have a week lag. It's a daily event and we can correct things daily as opposed to weekly. Okay, next step is to just put it into a spreadsheet. Pretty simple. Outputs of previous previous steps or inputs here. We're taking the output from that last step right here and and putting it in. And it's basically taking each of those items. So, do they have platform access? Do they have, you know, did you talk about the timeline? Do you talk about the deal review? Did you talk about the SIM request? you talk about the the follow-up calls over here, right? So again, this row, we just implemented this a month ago. Uh this was the first one. So it has the link to the actual call, it's got the summary, it's got the action items, it's got the transcript and the link to the transcript, and then yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, if Nathan had not done it, there would be a no here. And if there was a no here, we would know about it because of the the next steps. Again, Andy just figured this out. Andy is not a programmer. This does not take someone to be a programmer. Use claude to help you know walk them through it. Um once you've done it a few times it becomes kind of second nature. Uh and the next step is basically we have it update um in a channel in Slack called onboarding call and it updates with this message text and the the direct manager so the actual person who did did the call Nathan in this case is in that channel and then his direct manager Andy's in that channel. Uh, and I also ask to be added to that channel just so that they feel the overlord watching. And so that's kind of instant course correction. Um, as long as somebody is watching that. In addition, we could say if the answer was no, send an email or if the answer was no, have some way of notifying the direct manager, right? And and notifying obviously the person responsible. So there there's there can be immediate course correction. Uh, the next step is kind of internal. Uh we use ClickUp in this company and what it's looking for is it's basically looking up the person and then checking off something within their task item for both uh us and for them. Everything that we do kind of goes through these this automation so that we can actually see how far along every customer is in each of our in each of the platforms. This one is basically taking that task, finding the task um updating it and then the next one is doing the same thing but um for our purposes instead of for the the customer's purpose and so that that also influences all our reporting and so automatically we get all our reporting updated through this workflow. Instead of ClickUp, you might be using HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipe Drive, Go High Level, whatever, right? And you're up, you might be updating their their their pipe, right? Their status in their pipe. Maybe their their status changes. Maybe they come a sales qualified lead, maybe they don't. You could be also updating obviously all of the notes. Let's say it was a setting call, they were a no-show and they never showed up. That would that would be obvious, right? Because there's no transcript. You could automat automatically update it as a no-show. And again, all your reporting will automatically update for you. No one has to go in and, you know, click a one here or a zero there. So, hopefully this was helpful. I would also suggest that you check out a couple of the videos that Thiago and I did together. Um, one of which is everything around the master prompt and AI for productivity. I've never had a YouTube channel before and I've always been um a bit reclusive. I live in the middle of the forest and kind of exit my house only to play sports. But I've actually really enjoyed having a a channel to to share with people and and helping people out. So, you know, thank you for everyone who's commented and supported this and uh hopefully we'll continue to uh work together and share insights.
