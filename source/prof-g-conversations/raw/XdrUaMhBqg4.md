some of the biggest uses for AI you know are either the mundane things call centers and customer service or people generating girlfriends vast majority of the use cases for these um users is the walking Phoenix manifestation of having a virtual girlfriend maybe that's a good thing maybe it's a horrible [Music] thing Josh where does this podcast find you I'm in New York are you London or lond London go figure Cherry ho I can of an accent I I'm hoping I wish I'd got my kids here a little bit longer um I love to give at least my youngest a bit of a Scottish twang I was my dad I was fascinated people find my dad so charming and I figured out at a young age it was more the accent than anything he was saying but anyways let's bust right into it I think of you as this like very forward-looking big Vision Kind of Blue Flame thinker give me a sense for where your head is at in terms of what you're most bullish or bearish on as we head into the rest of 24 so from The Venture World you've got a serious retraction that we've sort of prophecied about two years ago and sometimes you know being early is the same thing as being wrong but it's um increasingly evident you've got pullback from General Partners who raise the funds uh limited partners who overallocated it to the asset class startups with an increasing number of um down rounds I think it's like 15 or 20% of all rounds being raised right now are down so valuations are lower from the last round that they raised at uh and you're going to have a lot of shutdowns that's also becoming increasing evidence so Venture world I would say is generally becoming more realistic but there's still a whole contingent of VCS that raised capital in the Zer environment I always say that low interest rates are like a tractor beam for the future and so people that are looking at low rates basically are like hey we can fund these crazy 20-year things these Elon things whether it's like neuralink or hyperloop or you know things that basically don't make sense in a short period of time when rates are high and now that rates are high and your tractor being comes in and you're basically looking 2 fet in front of you instead of 20 years out I still think that there's a whole cohort of venture investors that are going into crazy speculative sci-fi stuff and we love you know closing that gap between sci-fi and cfact but but some people I think are just going to end up losing a fortune going after all kinds of nonsensical stuff in in um Quantum Computing is something I'm very skeptical about Fusion is something I'm very skeptical about and then there's the reality and the hype which is what makes markets messy and beautiful in things like AI uh I would say that there's a 5year psychological bias where you want to be invested today where you should have been 5 years ago the Investments that we were making 5 years ago in companies like Mosaic which we sold to data braks and hugging face and others you know those are doing really well right now the incremental investment that people are making today at very high prices capturing the sentiment and demand for AI makes it really hard because you might be right about the technology but your expected return paying some crazy prices is is going to mean you know pretty significant investment losses so that's sort of the perview from Venture with large AI we can go into some of the details in AI where I think think that they segments and then the other wave that is at first people felt very uncomfortable with and now it has become undeniable and I think we're probably 3 four five years away from it being bubble like is Aerospace and defense and uh there you had Tailwinds where there were basically no Cutting Edge companies you had SpaceX on the one hand you had paler on the other uh we were early investors in andril which has become a hardware kinetic it was actually the first company that we as a partnership had to decide hey are we comfortable being part of a killchain where you know that you are funing technology that is not killing the cancer cell but might kill an enemy combatant and uh and that was a difficult partnership discussion but that became exhibit a for the wave in Aerospace and defense and now people are coming out of that company androll and starting new companies you're getting Capital formation dedicated funds whether it's you know firms calling it American dynamism or Global resilience uh packaging these things and then you're getting fun to funds that are investing in the space and that's actually really interesting because a CIO friend of mine said this space is really interesting for fund to funds because if you invest in a fund of funds that invests in a venture fund that invests in a company like andero you're at least two or three layers morally removed so it's a little bit easier from an investment committee to say hey like uh we're funding this stuff but we're not directly involved so I know I know enough about venture to be dangerous I want to put forward a thesis and you tell me if you know valid it or nullify it my sense is the opportunity when I talk to VCS is in follow on rounds of good companies where the valuations have been rationalized is that where the opportunity is there definitely is opportunity there you have to consider the thing that I think you're really brilliant in considering which is The Human Condition yes the rounds might be lower valuations but you've got people that were there 5 six seven years their options are underwater they need to be restructured or repriced maybe they're looking at Greener pasture somewhere else and so how do you retain talent in these down rounds is a is a pretty hard thing when you get this sort of spiral of of negative psychology I will say that one adjacent area and and we sort of come up with this framework this tri-party framework of um what I call bubble anti-bubble and consolidation so bubble is not actually hope that there's a bubble like the old bumper sticker following the last.com blue bus Which said you know please God let there be another bubble um this is putting people in a protective bubble for basically two and a half three years so that they can basically be relatively ignorant or immune from the volatility and vicissitudes of markets whatever happens with Trump and Biden Wars Etc they just focus on their technology they can do it in a in a bubble protected by enough Capital when they go out and actually prove that they did what they said they could do and raise their next round the second is anti-bubble which is sort of what you're talking about which is how do you get a later stage asset less risky but at an early stage price so that you can get higher returns and I think actually the one interesting niche in this are corporate spinouts corporates are always on one hand a little bit late to the game you know as Venture investors but in the past 10 years you had meta um alphabet Microsoft but particularly the former 2 funding all these other projects and about a year ago there was a whistle that I heard and the whistle was Chris hone from children's investment fund he's an activist investor very successful one and he wrote a public letter to Google and said you got to cut all these other projects this 20% time that people are doing these these fanciful things where you're trying to retain Talent you got to focus on contribution margins you got to stop wasting money and they and others have listened budgets have been cut for some of these programs and they're legitimately good as Standalone Ventures but not as divisions of these big tech companies so we did two spinouts in the past year and I predict we'll probably do another two or three over the next 12 months we took one group out of Google which basically created a Shazam for smell so the ability to walk into a room and using Cutting Edge AI with sensors be able to detect what is that smell what is that odor and that can be used for Health Care from everything from like uh detecting covid Parkinson's Alzheimer's all of which have a disease State a chemical signature that gives off we know that dogs can be trained to sense that so why can't machines so that was one it's called the osmo osmo a run by a brilliant PhD and uh they just weren't get to get the funding at Google and we said spin out we'll give you some residual common Equity did a $60 million founding round and that's a good playbook so let's talk a little bit about AI there's a general sense or there's a fear or risk that it'll destroy jobs and consolidate power I do it does feel as if the biggest players are the the guys we know already um that the majority of the market cap is ACC Creed or market cap has accreted to you know the microsofts or the world what do you believe that it's going to be a net Destroyer or creator of jobs uh it net destroyer of existing jobs but it's going to create new jobs and that's always been the case so the jobs that people have done over the past 15 years with the Advent of you know the it Revolution going back 30 years nobody ever forecast like you know HTML designer or JavaScript programmer or um web coder or social media marketing influencer Guru so all these things I think in a sense democratize the ability for people to express their genius it makes it harder when everybody can do it because you have a supply of talent the interesting people that are getting hit now because of Technology are actually the wi collar workers I mean the people that are doing frankly jobs you know consultants and copywriters and people that increasingly some of these chat Bots can do as good or in some cases better than they can do the group that I actually think is more protected ironically are the blue collar workers you know there's a shortage of nurses massive shortage of nurses in this country there's a shortage of plumbers massive shortage of plumbers and these are things that we just don't think about and we sort of look down upon and you go back to like uh you know Workshop is soulcraft and and people actually using their hands that combined with technology is a theme that I'm actually really excited about it's this idea of Maintenance and if you think about the past I don't know 10 years everything's been about growth growth growth and you know you know accounting you talk about the flaw accounting of a lot of these big tech companies you take capex it's got two components you got growth and you got maintenance everybody's been funding growth growth growth maintenance you have trillions of assets from basic infrastructure apartment buildings the human body Hospital Systems there's all kinds of things where you can apply new technology to maintaining these systems and I think that labor Blue Collar labor is going to be a critical piece of that so it sounds like you think there's there's investment opportunity and like hard assets that have been overlooked is that what you're saying well that's true also because regardless of what expectations and we've been sort of saying for I don't know two or three quarters that maybe rates don't go lower maybe the cost of capital naturally is higher even though we're in election year and they're trying to press things down create a stock market wealth effect and but people are looking at their everyday inflation uh hit goods and they're feeling pain uh I actually think that when rates are rising you know Geniuses like Buffett figured this out you want to invest in capital intensive Industries as early as possible because the replication cost of those hard assets is just really hard to do and cost of capital is much higher so I do think hard assets this touches everything from Industrials infrastructure Aerospace and defense um and uh and I I I think that has been an underinvested sector of the Venture world and you're seeing a ton of talent going into this I mean I can tell you right now andil some of these people work they best for four years this is the the defense company um you know raised billions of dollars generating billions of Revenue like one of the great successes in the in the space that people are pointing to but these people that work there are super talented and they're spinning off from andil from SpaceX and they're going into not SAS companies or chat Bots they're going into composite manufactur facturing rebuilding the Arsenal of American democracy with Hardware manufacturing building robots that build robots so that is actually a really I think underappreciated thing that in the next few years people look back and be like oh I should have been invested in that what do you think our economy's Achilles heel is right now ourselves people I mean we're we're our own you know you you talk about this I think brilliantly a lot but we are Our Own Worst Enemy um just the divisiveness um there there's so many opportunities for people to come together I actually think that that will probably be with foreign adversaries that unite us again um I thought it was going to happen earlier with China and the Communist Chinese Communist party it really hasn't as much but uh yeah I think we're the biggest obstacle it's not foreign adversaries foreign adversaries can exploit our divisiveness but it's it's our intrinsic divisiveness that I think is slowing us down that's the biggest friction of uh of progress yeah we're brothers from another mother on this one um what do you um you had also said that we should be spending less time thinking about fusion and more about fision do I have that right yeah this goes back to this idea again people looking at far out ideas and you're always trying to look at the next thing I mean this is what makes music great right young people don't want to listen to their parents music they want their own thing they don't want to wear the old clothes they want to invent their new thing well it's the same thing for technology investors they're always thinking about what's new what's next we do the same thing but we try to temper ourselves with reality the reality is fishing is amazing we've got Decades of very safe use and lots of records of um of of how to operate these plants we have a declining labor for for supporting them which we should adjust goes back to this idea of supporting these blue collar workers and maintenance of systems that we already have but we used to have 104 domestic reactors in the US now it's down to 90s something you've lost political support in not only the us but in many countries Germany which shut down their nuclear even though you had an engineer at the Helm of the of the country and its leadership in Angela Merkel and what happened in Germany they delivered themselves literally to the Natural Gas grip of Putin and created uh created enormous dependencies right now there's five countries that can basically Drive nuclear and it's interesting because this sort of comes back to AI in a sec but you've got France you've got South Korea you've got UAE you've got Russia and you've got China and I testified in front of Congress last summer basically saying this is another threat that we are not appreciating that threat being the US has gone from 104 to 90 something reactors we've declined the cost for the newest reactor that we put up which was in Georgia about 68 10 billion dollars a gwatt to serve roughly a million people per gwatt China is doing it for about a billion and a half2 billion dollar okay fifth of the cost 80% less why is that important they went from two reactors to 20 on their way to 50 but now they're exporting that technology and if you are a geopolitical strategist if you care about foreign policy your state department your Department of Defense you do not want China reactors all along the coast of Africa or South America providing large Basel load power and creating decades long dependency on China to provide Fuel and maintenance and uh you know basically controlling the ultimate kill switch of the electricity for your economy so us should really be getting aggressive to uh to combat that it's interesting because I I think people nuclear sort of had another moment and it seems as if it's stalled is it because of it's like the the New York Subway system we just can't produce it as inexpensively as everyone else is the is the technology not Advanced how come similar to other Tech the price has not come down uh well I I think the biggest obstacle here again is people and so it's the perception I am encouraged it's going to take longer than we expect I mean you'd love to see like my God this nuclear Renaissance and Reawakening um you know I joke that if people discovered nuclear power today atomic energy they would just be like running around you know with their their minds blown just being like Oh my God we just discovered magic we had this very unfortunate phenomenon in my mother's generation late '70s when uh you had three mile island in the US followed quickly by China Syndrome exactly and then you had a certifiable disaster in the 80s with Russian technology in Chernobyl but you know nobody's ever bought anything from Russia other than Cuba buying some uh you know data cars and um AK-47s and Mig fighter jets because those actually had to compete on a global stage but those were disasters then you had Fukushima where we actually had a company called curion that ended up being the only us company for that cleanup and that was also a disaster um and and so it it spooked people and in Three Mile Island nobody died there was you know it was actually a exhibit a of good uh engineered fall tolerance systems so I think that you need a Zeitgeist change and I'm seeing young environmentalists really bullish on nuclear I'm seeing influencers you know hyping up nuclear and so the mindset is changing it's probably going to take another three four five years I've tried my part instead of calling it nuclear which again back to my mom's generation like this conflated it with James Taylor and Laura nairo and Neil Young protesting you know no nukes that's a good thing we don't want nuclear war but you do want nuclear power because it's great for the world change it from nuclear to what I call Elemental energy people love elements they love the sun solar they love the wind wind power they love water Hydro what about rocks well there's good rocks and bad rocks bad rocks are coal good rocks uranium zero carbon beautiful large basad power Elemental energy H what you I mean you you sort of see how the sausage is getting made and that is you're in the front lines of where value gets created when you look Downstream at public companies and you look at the tech sector or open it up to every sector what public companies do look at or sectors and think that's where I would bet you know everything has been very overvalued in the Magnificent 7 um that's driven as much by expectations and flow of capital as it is by fundamentals to Microsoft's credit they made a roughly 1010 billion doll commitment to open AI a year and a half ago or they're about created a trillion dollars or coincided with a trillion dollars of market cap value that's just absolutely incredible it's one of the greatest Investments you know in in uh in Tech History um so you have a dynamic in the AI world and we can go back and talk about AI because I think there's some interesting things there but um where I think the market in the street is now saying show me show me that you've got pricing power if you're Adobe show me that you're going from 20 bucks a month to 30 bucks a month if you're Microsoft and you got the Office 365 Suite that you are actually generating premium pricing power or that you were generating cost reduction and there was a lot of Buzz about Clara and the ability to reduce customer service agents or make those more effective so that to me is the next one or two quarters that people are going to be looking at to show me that this actually translates into contribution margin and and and profitability that we can put multiples on and extrapolate but otherwise in many of these cases it's a race to the zero the one public company that I found interesting in recent years and I think it's been underappreciated in the AI revolution has been Cloud flare and so this is sort of like you go back 204 years ago it's almost like the aami of today in caching some of this content Distributing Edge computes so that people can access and do if you're in AI inference and training at the edge so interesting business you know I'm a venture investor I leave you know all the public Market stuff to my much smarter wife who runs an activist head fund but that one's interesting you mentioned Quantum Computing as something that you're sort of bearish on are there other sectors or companies that you think are kind of that the performance isn't going to match the promise uh that infusion and in both cases both are like historically the Pinnacle of what scientific America Scientific American Magazine probably put on their cover for I don't know 40 issues over the past 20 years you know the quantum Revolution is just around the corner maybe I'm tooo cynical so you have to handicap what I'm saying but for the past 20 plus years we've been pitched two dozen plus Quantum Computing companies and we've even invested in a few that have basically said we're going to have unbreakable cryptography we're going to have the ability to model molecules and design drugs we're going to have um uh totally encrypted Communications and none of those things have materialized and when they have materialized it's been because of gpus and clusters of Novel architectures nothing to do with Quantum Computing but you get one of these machines but the copper wires and all the things that look like you know a Tesla orb and and uh and people just go Gaga and I think that a lot of these entrepreneurs are somewhere between naive if you give them Credence and maliciously fraudulent if you don't and uh they're exploiting what I call ignorance Arbitrage oh Scott you know this thing's got two ftoc and heeling for uh a Quantum and and you're like oh that sounds amazing but it's just it's it's a lot of as Marie Gman called Quantum flap doodle a lot of what is your take on the entire crypto Market do you think I mean it's had an incredible Resurgence there's some tech there there's some you know a lot of branding a lot of marketing are do you own any crypto uh we do personally as a as a speculative kind of thing the fund has owned some we've made a bunch of Investments more in the infrastructure so something like um Anchorage which is a custodian for assets they don't care goes up goes down this is something that people need they're like the top institutional custodian so things like that have done okay um you know it's interesting in that you had all the tour come in you had all the hype all the BS and then it's sort of crashed it's reached you know alltime highs or close to it um and you have people that are sort of back into it I'm seeing that there's nft parties again which I think are you know personally insane but um there'll be something there I don't want to completely crap on that because the the core piece of that the compute the infrastructure algorithms that people are trying to find traceability in digital assets there's something there it just hasn't materialized yet which is not to say it won't but it's not something that we're like pouring our attention into I'm much more excited about Robotics and and biology the other interesting thing is is energy use which a lot of people were building these data centers and um they were trying to do approximate just like you know 20 years ago when when the first Cloud infrastructure was being built out approximate to hydrop power some of the crypto people were doing the same thing but now they got repurposed into Ai and I actually find tying some of these themes together uh you may have seen this but Amazon announced that they are um buying or bought a data center that is entirely powered by nuclear it's I think 960 megawatts just under a gwatt $650 million this is one of the first nuclear powerered data centers so that to me is interesting because it actually went from being used for crypto mining to now being used for for Cutting Edge Ai and then you know you zoom out into the big picture on AI you've got you know basically chat Bots which I think are reaching their Pinnacle of becoming commodity you've got chips which everybody knows Nvidia people are increasingly appreciating AMD and some of the other languages that are popping up like pie torch to be able to run on some of these novel chips even arm and Google and their TPU so the chips piece and then you've got this weird thing which you know it feels very I don't know gallowan which is which is chips so you got you know chat Bots chips and chicks chicks what do I mean being L and crude some of the biggest uses for AI you know are either the mundane things call centers and customer service or people generating girlfriends uh and it speaks to the thing that you've long talked about about the epidemic of loneliness and you know the sort of incels in their basement but company like character AI which we're not invested in but it's been an interesting phenomenon vast majority of the use cases for these um users is the walking Phoenix manifestation of having a virtual girlfriend maybe that's a good thing maybe it's a horrible thing to feel validated by somebody that understands you better than some of your friends or potential girlfriend to I guess be honest or live a personal fantasy but but that phenomenon I think is something that is driving the vast majority of the profitable Revenue generating uses today for AI that aren't in the mundane things like customer service and and call centers and do you see when you look at the Magnificent 7 going back to them but who stack rank who you're most bullish and bearish on in the Magnificent 7 most bullish at the moment on the cleverness of Microsoft again not only that1 billion be trillion but think about the way that they structured these deals I mean they have figured out the regulatory Arbitrage between doj and FTC they know that they couldn't Buy open AI but they effectively control it right I mean all the ecosystems even the the thing that slipped in in one of these board meetings I think where SAA was like we control them top bottom left right we've got all the IP we've got all the data if they went out tomorrow you know we we own everything or control everything I don't want to get the words precisely wrong um so Microsoft has done that there they did it with inflection you know inflection raised I don't know billion million and a half something like that and then uh for 675 million or 650 million just a few weeks ago Microsoft announced that they got a a Perpetual license you know to the technology again very clever way of routing around FTC doj uh prevention of that but at a time when the big tech companies can't get Acquisitions done Microsoft is really clever at how they're really doing Acquisitions they got Mustafa Soloman who wrote the big book but co-founded Deep Mind with Demis uh they got that core team and uh and they left this little shell you know of inflection for the other investors I know the investors actually you know ended up making a little bit of money the way it was structured uh so Microsoft has captured it uh Amazon Amazon has been behind and everybody's criticizing Amazon they're coming up on the one-year anniversary of Bedrock which was one of their platforms it's adjacent to and they've partnered with our company hugging face which is the main repository for all the AI ml models sort like the GitHub of of AI um they're going to have the most performative model on that which is uh Claude and anthropic for now until gbt 5 launches or whatever comes next they will have it for biology with one of our companies that will be announced uh and they'll probably have one in robotics and some other domains so I think Amazon is sort of quiet and steady and they were rightly getting criticized I mean Alexa and that kind of stuff sucks and they'll have to redo that internally but in their Corp Dev program very bullish on on what they've done um and then you've got Google which is facing this you know they let the inmates run the Asylum you had the Gemini disaster with all their woke and stuff that you know corrupted these models you now have the founders coming back in making public appearances pressure building um on uh on Sundar and so that to me is an interesting Dynamic and then you've got perplexity which is the startup that's sort of starting to eat Google's lunch on the search piece Google's what 240 250 280 billion uh search you know ad business and and uh I don't know 95% of the searches on Google are like five words you know you type something quick but on perplexity they're like 10 plus words so they're going after that classic disrupt you know innovators dilemma piece of longtail questions and I know more and more people certainly I use perplexity way more than Google uh these days so so that to me sort of interesting you know Tesla I have been a long bear I've accepted that regardless of what I think about it uh it is a religion sort of like the people that are buying Trump social or you know true social or whatever it's hard to short a religion it's hard to short people that are you know getting the logo tattooed on on their body you know uh there I just I would personally stay away even though I uh have been very um critical of elon's relationship with the truth um and then Apple they haven't had a hit product in I don't know 2016 with airpods really I mean I got Vision Pro I think it's super cool we've got meta um uh VR as well and it's a preview of what's to come and I do believe that it's the worst version of Vision Pro that they'll ever have it'll keep getting better and it'll get smaller and it won't be so uh heavy on your head but they need something new and uh you can make the argument Google also hasn't really come out with something new in a very long time time um they all have a lot of cash they can't really do big Acquisitions unless they're as clever as Microsoft and uh you know you saw Apple shut down their uh special car uh program projects rumors about them getting into robotics you know I'm one of the early suckers I've got one of those Amazon Astros you know running around my house to my kids and my wife sh grin but um you can see in home robots from Apple being a product category as speculative and crazy as that might be but uh you know and then Netflix is amongst the crazy streaming Wars and but but I think the most important thing here is that the combined market cap of all these companies is still just bigger than you know most other countries you know Mark entire market caps and uh of their of the cumulative you know stock markets and I think that's the key is we just have to make sure that we maintain that the top five seven 10 companies in the world are not bu do and bu dance and tensent and uh and and financial or or Alibaba uh that they are competitive non-state owned things that approach truth instead of an ASM toote of it as as many of the Chinese companies do Josh Wolf is the co-founder of Lex capital a venture capital firm that focuses on investments and

you've got you have you define the term like I feel like I'm on a 386 chip and you're an Nvidia chip I have it's a literally a calorie burn for me just to keep up with how fast your brain processes but I love I just love your take on stuff thanks for your time thanks man it's great to be with you [Music]
