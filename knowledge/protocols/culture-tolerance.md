# Culture = What You Tolerate

> Your culture is defined by the behaviors you tolerate, not the values on your wall.

## The Principle

Everyone watches the leader. When someone violates values and nothing happens, that behavior becomes the actual culture.

## The Protocol

### 1. Define Culture Through Firing

The first time someone violates a core value:
- Have the conversation immediately
- If it continues, fire them—even if they're a top performer

> "You have to be willing to let go of people even if they're high performers if they violate the values, because otherwise you're just telling everybody that the values don't matter."

### 2. The Hard Conversation Rule

> "The distance between where you are and where you want to be is the number of hard conversations you're willing to endure."

Most leaders avoid hard conversations with:
- Underperforming people they like
- High performers who are jerks
- Clients who violate boundaries

Each avoided conversation = culture erosion.

### 3. Onboarding Prevents Problems

Don't let people onboard themselves:
- 90-day plan with clear deliverables
- Day 1, Week 1, Month 1, Day 90 milestones
- Daily KPIs so they know if they're winning

> "Inexperienced founders hire someone, get excited to not manage them, let them flail around making up their own job, then 60-90 days later say 'you're not doing your job.'"

## The Test

Ask: "What behavior would get someone fired here, even if they were crushing their numbers?"

If you can't answer immediately, your culture is undefined.

### B. Applies To Clients Too

If you tolerate:
- Scope creep
- Late payments
- Disrespectful behavior

That's your client culture. Fire clients who violate values.

### C. Related Concepts

- Hard conversations as growth metric
- 90-day onboarding
- Frustration tolerance (having hard conversations is uncomfortable)
