most of us are showing up to work because we need the money or the insurance or it's a status thing Dr Robert Butler who who was the first director of the National Institutes on Aging uh analyzed the writings of several thousand people over time and found that people who could articulate their sense of purpose uh were living about 8 years longer than people who are [Music] rudderless Dan where does this podcast find you 17 blocks from the Raleigh Hotel pool let's bust right into it your focus is longevity so let's start there can you break down what a quote unquote Blue zone is a blue zone is a geographically defined demographically confirmed area where people live statistically longest and we measure that through either lowest rate of middle-age mortality Andor highest centinary in rate so mostly we're looking at life expectancy of people about our age because that factors out things like testosterone toxicity and uh infant mortality and then what did you find my guess is everybody and I know some of this but what are the common features of Lifestyles and habits uh for people who live in these areas where they tend to live longer I assume it's not the geography although maybe that has something to do with it odly geography does have something to do geography has more to do with it than genes CU only about 20% of how long we live is dictated by our genes and these places are genetically heterogeneous which is to say they're melting pots each of these places you you find them on about the 20th parallel North so it's neither the tropics where people are baguer by infectious disease nor are they too far north where they don't get enough sunshine and Outdoor Activity and and you know in the case of the blue zones uh access to uh fresh fruits and vegetables but um the the common denominators they're eating mostly a whole food plant-based diet the the the five pillars of every longevity diet in the world are whole grains uh greens and garden vegetables and so forth tubers interestingly about 75% of the caloric intake in Okinawa a place that produced the longest live women in history came from the purple sweet potato until about 1990 and then um nuts and beans beans are the Cornerstone of every longevity diet and if you're eating a cup of beans a day it's probably worth about four extra years of life expectancy so let me get this if I want to add for I mean I realize there's more to it here but if you wanted to add call it multiple years of life expectancy one serving of beans a day about a cup it's a associate it and it may be because there's something crazy good in beans or it might be because if you're getting your protein from beans instead of bacon uh you're getting the longevity bump but it definitely Stacks the deck in favor of Longevity if you're eating a cup of beans a day so say more about the common denominators I've read your book and there's a few of them yes people seem to have a sense of purpose there's vocabulary for purpose in every Blue Zone so they're not waking up with sort of the existential uh stress of what am I going to do with our my day uh they live in places where it's easy to move naturally uh they're nudged into movement every 20 minutes as opposed to thinking they're going to they can sit all day long at their offices and make it up in the gym um every time they go to work or a friend's house or out to eat at occasions a walk uh they have Gardens out back their houses aren't full of the me mechanical conveniences that have engineered mostly phys activity out of our lives and the the the scourge of Network Technology hasn't quite struck blue zones yet so most social interactionist face to face and they get a lot of it largely as a result of their environment so you can't step outside of your home and not uh bump into your neighbor or your aunt or person who delivers your mail um so there's spontaneous social interaction which in some Studies have shown the these low quality social interactions are as predictive of longevity as you know deep meaningful conversations and what about their social life or how they engage with others well they tend to live in extended families they keep their aging parents nearby which which conveys a two to six year uh additional life expectancy as opposed to putting uh your aging parent in a retirement home they tend to be married or living with a partner invest heavily in their kids uh they live in walkable Villages so they're constantly interacting with others the festivals is a a U part of the daily the annual cycle of Life uh in ikaria for example one of our blue zones there's 90 festivals uh between April and September and people show up to them not only as kind of a social obligation but because they're fun but what happens at these festivals is people build bonds social bonds there there's almost always a philanthropic um objective to the party plus they're dancing all night which is great for of physical activity but but the key Insight Scott to longevity and this is where we get it wrong in America in America we tend to pursue Health and Longevity uh we get in mind a diet an exercise program um maybe a supplement program uh longevity hacks and then we pursue it but the problem is our our brains are wired for novelty and we get bored very quickly we lose discipline we lose presence of mind and if you look at any of the sort of uh strategies we undertake to get healthier live longer lose weight they never worked for more than about nine months and then the vast majority of people have failed in blue zones longevity isn't pursued it ensues which is a huge difference in other words people in blue zones have no idea how they're living an extra 10 years at middle age than Americans do they just live their lives but if you look at their environments they're living in places where they unconscious decisions they micro day-to-day decisions are better uh for not only a few months or a year or two but for decades or a lifetime uh because when it comes to longevity there's no short-term fix it's it's regular better day-to-day decisions for a long time that make the the big difference and that doesn't happen with the conscious mind it feels as if it's a little bit okay I have my life here in London I try to purposely eat better I have a trainer uh to get in my exercise but and it I don't know if you've heard but the weather in London is somewhere between awful and wor whatever is worse than awful weather yeah there you go that that is kind of the wrong way to live long it's about Mo moving to Greece where I'm forced to walk somewhere the Mediteranean diet just kind of unfolds on me I'm living close to my family so I have no choice but to be highly social it feels like it's more of a instead of the accoutrements it is your life is that is is that a decent way to describe it yes it's about Shifting the focus from trying to change your behavior which fails for almost all people almost all the time in the long run to shapen your environment and of course the easiest way to shape your environment for longevity is as you point out is move and there are areas in America where life expectancy is 25 years less than other places if you there Co in Kentucky where life expectancy is 25 years below say Boulder Colorado uh but uh what we found and the main focus of my work for the past 15 years has been shaping people's environment at the population level largely through policy but also through helping restaurants grocery stores workplaces schools and even your home are designed so that the healthy choice is either the Easy Choice or the unavoidable choice and that's what works it's an interesting way of looking at it let's you mentioned Kentucky let's go to the other side I don't know if you have a term form gray zones or you know dead zones but what is it about specifically about these places where people live a lot less healthy lives and have much higher mortality what are the commonalities of the common denominators there they're crisscrossed with highways uh unwalkable streets so every time you go to work you have to get in your car um where you more people have died in car accidents that in the last 100 years than have died in wars so right there is your first mortality challenge then the fact you're not walking they tend to be Junk Food Forest there's no effort to curb accessibility or junk food marketing so junk food and alra processed food is delicious and it's cheap and it's ubiquitous and that's why we eat so much of it uh not because we know it's not that good for us that there's typically higher crime uh people are more socially isolated think think of a Suburban culdesac as opposed to you know downtown London where you live where every time you step outside your door there's a chance to bump into somebody and there's at least a chance that there'll be a meaningful social connection for you uh often air quality which is also a function of traffic it's a a number of smaller things that add up to um Decades of Life dis expectancy disparity you talked about purpose break down a little bit more a little bit about work i' I've read somewhere that work used to be dirty dangerous work now work for many people is purpose and that their mortality actually goes up especially men when they stop working talk unpack work and Longevity a Gallop pole of 2 million workers found that only about 31% fewer than a third of Americans is actually F purpose at work so most of us are showing up to work because we need the money or the insurance or it's a status thing Dr Robert Butler who who was the first director of the National Institutes on Aging uh analyzed the writings of several thousand people over time and found that people who could articulate their sense of purpose uh were living about eight years longer than people who are rudderless now we don't know if that's because um people with sens purpose there some sort of a mechanism that makes us rise to the occasion psychosomatic benefit or if it's because people who have a sense of purpose are more likely to stay fit and take their medicines and make an effort with other people in in connecting or or uh find a job where uh they're not bored or uninspired uh it's so it's so important and it's so largely overlooked in in the United States I believe I've been reading that there's just a ton of stress placed on parents that uh and I've also read other places that actually while your kids are kind of while you have kids in the house you're actually less happy than people without kids talk about the ideal scenario from a longevity standpoint for someone's relationship status kids no kids eight kids one kid married boyfriend girl whatever it might be what is kind of the what is the ideal scenario and what is kind of the worst case scenario I imagine the worst case scenario is just to be totally alone but that's my thesis let me yes that's the worst case let me unpack a few things so there you know I also wrote a book uh in a cover story for National Geographic on happiness called the Blue zones of Happiness there there's two scientific ways of measuring happiness the first one is something called life satisfaction where you essentially ask people to think of their life as a whole and rated on a scale of 1 to 10 and that's evaluative that's it's your life in the rearview mirror the other way is something called affect positive or negative AFF effect and that's measured by a Time sequence of asking people how often they laugh cry feel stress feel worry and that's more of an evaluative or how you experience happiness uh people who have babies both the men and the women tend to experience a dramatic drop and affect in other words their experience happiness drop and predictably you know they're exhausted or or there's stress money stress in the family or you know that wife doesn't want to have sex because she just had a be whatever but um life satisfaction goes up so you get this sort of up and down of of happiness and it's the picture is not clear um in places like Denmark both kinds of Happiness go up presumably because there's better uh child care and for the first year of Life both the man and women can take up to 12 months off to take care of that that that infant uh as far as longevity we did a study in Sardinia Sardinia is home to the longest lived men in the world about 11 times more male cenarius there than you'd expect to see in a similar population in the United States and the guys with the best chance of reaching age 100 had five or more daughters specifically daughters and we don't know interesting if that's because you daughters tend to take care of their aging uh fathers in that culture or if it's because there's a selection bias that if you can survive five adolescent girls making it to 100s no problem um but it's very clear it's got to be the former isn't I would just think that's what I'm I would just think logically I always joke I wish I'd had I have two boys I always wish I'd had had a daughter cuz I was thought the daughter would take care of me the daughter would call me and say Dad did you pick up your medication dad did you get your colonoscopy that they're that they would you know that they make sure that you you're taking care of yourself and to me that makes just sort of it's it's so funny that um that seems so obvious and I never thought that have a bunch of daughters to live longer yeah living in extended family seems to be a trend in all blue zones and and I know people think the idea of their parents living with them might be horrible but often there's there's not a choice in blue zones but you see very tangible benefits something called the grandmother effect has shown not only in several cultures but actual several uh mammal species that those that keep a parent near the family the children in those families have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease uh and not only that if you know if you're aging mom's living with you she's not in retirement home again retirement home instant lowering a life expectancy um so there's sort of a beautiful symbiosis uh that you see in in uh in in families so having children raising them well I would argue not coddling them you don't see coddled children in the blue zones children are expected to be contributing members of the family they're out sometimes in the field they're gold herders by the age of 8 or 12 8 between 8 and 12 they're uh helping with kitchen chores they're not just you know being driven to dance lessons and play dates like we typically see there is a chance that they could get hurt you know they they have to take on um some responsibility and the attendant risk with that at a very early age as opposed to waiting age 25 to you know have to take your first risk in life yeah I mean some much this is encouraging and dis discouraging I don't do you have kids Dan I have three and how do you so my kids basically get up you know I I I I hate to admit this it's our fault my kids don't even make their beds they the the most active thing they do is they they do take the tube they do play sports at school but they are coddled I mean they really are and so how what is your approach after doing all of this research what is your approach to raising your children that might be a little different than what how other people raise their kids well at a certain point in my life I I told them I needed them at a very early age and I gave them chores I did need them I needed them psychologically at that point but I also you know logistically needed help and you know I never made money till I was 40 and I made a lot of money um but uh in a way it was a gift to live in a household where uh you know we we had to make our own fun and I I needed them to help me with the laundry Etc and and uh with the yard and I think at the end of the day that was that was good it was a gift for them and why is that I'm I'm going to probe here are you a single father yes so during that time you know I I I needed them I enjoyed having them around me um but they they all they all work they were supposed to do I also you know we didn't go to Disney World we would go to the Yucatan Peninsula and crawl through batshit caves when they were 8 9 10 years old and we would live in villages with yucatech Maya and childhood with me wasn't safe in the immediate sense of the word but I believe it gave them enormous resilience for later in life they're three very successful adults right now we'll be right back I like to think I can point I can identify people who are CEOs I've spent so much time with good and bad CEOs that when I interview a CEO for a position as a director on a board I feel like I'm a pretty good study I'm not good at assessing other employees I get fooled all the time but I get I think I can kind of sum up someone's CEO Readiness or not what are the things a do you believe you can do that and B what are sort of the obvious tells when you when you spend say an hour with somebody well just just to level set the the chances of reaching a 100 in America are less than one in a thousand so the the capacity the human machine so the average person our age is for men it's probably 93 maybe 94 and for women it might be 96 so making it to 100 uh is exponentially more difficult than hitting uh the the early mid 90s so um what okay per say you know I look at you and I say I think you have a pretty good chance at reaching uh that uh capacity of the human machine and it might go up by the way but by the time you know it's our time we might get to 100 but you're thin or you seemingly you're not overweight you you're obviously Physically Active uh you live in London which I would say Stacks the deck in favor of longevity because you're you walk most places you're uh mentally engaged you seem to exude uh purpose I don't know what you eat but a few questions I could uh if I could uh how how often a week do you eat meat 10 plus I would eat it every meal if I could I eat a lot of meat that is probably tripling your chances for cardiovascular disease um many types of cancers you're not a big candidate for type 2 diabetes but if you an average American that much meat would be a negative how about processed foods not as much and what's interesting about the UK is one of the things I've noticed here and I think it's much healthier uh you buy milk you buy fruit that you buy you know juice anything what you notice is wow it rots right right away and then what you realize is there are thousands of pesticides and preservatives that are legal in the US that are not legal here and it never struck me just how much I was putting in my body in the US till I moved to London and I'm blessed I have somebody who loves to cook so when I eat out I eat fairly well but when you eat out my sense is it's full of butter and salt so you come back so I don't eat a I probably on the lower scale of processed food that's good eating out in America by the way aasian consuming about 300 more calories than you would if you eat at home higher salt higher sugar as well so eating at home Stacks a deck in your favor how about how about your height to your midsection are you are you measuring in centimeters or inches are you are you at least twice as tall as you are at the midsection oh yeah I'm I'm I'm 62 189 I'm in good shape that's exactly what I am exactly are you shrinking though I was 6'3 now I'm 6'2 I was 6 and a half and now I'm 6'2 yeah so I I am shrinking a little bit every Everybody shrinks a lot you know it's a effect of gravity over time how many hours of sleep do you get good about sleep I don't I don't sleep as well because I have to get up and pee a lot but if I'm if if I can't sleep and it's 2: or 3: in the morning I will and we'll come back to this I will take an edible and I will cancel my meetings in the morning because I I don't I spent so much of my life Dan working so hard that sometimes I would go four or five hours a night for three or four days in a row because I was traveling and just going from meeting to meeting and meeting and pretty much since the age of 45 I don't sacrifice sleep so I'm pretty good on the Sleep other than the fact I have to get up and pee all the time yeah me too on that one when you look at mortality and number of hours slept per night people who sleep 7 hours seem to be optimal uh getting at least seven hours most nights that seems to be the Sweet Spot um and so if you're getting that that's going to favor life expectancy how about how about uh fruits and vegetables do you eat those every day terrible two to three times a week Max and the fruits I eat are it's in the form of juice which has a ton of sugar in it juice is horrible it's all metabolically as bad for you as a Coke yeah so I I mean mid 80s maybe for you mid 80s all right I better go okay so I I got I got to get on this whole success and meaning finding meaning in one's life what about the I'm by the way just just to put a finer point a more serious point on it there's very good research that shows that people are eating mostly a whole food plant-based diet uh isoing a standard American diet at our age 60 live about six years longer than people eating a meaty cheesy fatty processed food diet so there's real benefits uh to starting right away yeah I I'm 100% to late in other words the other question I have is you know asking for a friend alcohol and uh THC alcohol and drugs okay so I'm I'm I'm a bit of a contrarian when it when it comes to alcohol I'm very aware of the recent epidemiology that no amount of alcohol is safe but I can tell you in these blue zones Highlands of Sardinia in in Iaria uh and I've seen the surveys I've been part of the surveys about 90% of people are making it into their mid90s and hundreds are drinking every day of their lives now are they doing shots at tequila with their friends no they're drinking mostly homemade wine with friends or with a meal so could they live to 101 instead of 90 maybe but it's so clear that part of the fabric of their culture their festivals the way they're connecting with friends the way they're uh how this wine is interacting with the the the diet they're eat eating by the way a glass of wine with a plant-based meal about quadres the flavonoid absorption so uh I'm not at all convinced that being a tea toer is healthier than drinking now I would argue a um a glass or two of wine with me and friends I believe is part of is helping these people in blue zones live longer you're kind of you're the Original Gangster around this stuff I remember when did blue zones come out I wrote the cover story for National Geographic in 2005 so almost 20 years ago yeah and I'm sure you're watching over the last one or two years Andrew huberman and Peter ATA both of whom are doctors huberman and at have both of them had both of them on the podcast and they have essentially declared war on alcohol and some of this is just to make myself feel better but I've always seen and read including from your books that social engagement or being really social is important a longevity and overall happiness and I find that alcohol is a critical component of that at least it is for me and I think it is for young people well you see doctors and uh marketers also they they tend to want to identify the silver bullet and sell it to you uh they tend to look things in isolation but I I've spent 20 years with these five blue zones I'm there every year and I I I believe I know and have read and metabolized every single academic paper there's a very clear cluster of Lifestyle characteristics that keep people doing the right things and avoiding the wrong things for long enough so they're not getting disease and those are eating mostly a whole food plant-based diet with a little alcohol moving naturally every 20 minutes or so not marathons not triathlons not Pilates or CrossFit they're mostly walking by the way their life is underpinned with purpose so they know why they wake up in the morning and what what their responsibility is to the Greater Community not just to their selfish selves um they uh tend to curate a circle of friends that reinforce the right behaviors and insulate them from loneliness and from the stresses of running out of money or a spouse leaving them or a parent dying or a kid getting thick and they live in places where the healthy choice is the easy choice and it's that cluster of things that's mostly environmental that is producing extra measurable extraordinary longevity in five disperate places on the globe and for me that's a pers Ave argument of what to do to live to 100 so let's talk a little bit of so let's talk about the us if the Biden Administration and maybe they have said to you Dan what series of what two or three policies could we Implement to dramatically raise not only the lifespan but the health span the quality of life of Americans what would those two or three policies be well I'm going to tell you they're not going to be popular um first of all Universal healthc care every blue zones uh the access to uh Health Care is close to free not only that there's a a much uh better emphasis on public health um so rather than trying to uh pay for cleaning up the disease they're they're investing the the disease to keep the disease from happening in the first place there's just no question that universal healthcare 11% of Americans don't even have uh health insurance in this country number two gas should be PRI gasoline should be priced at a price very similar to the what you pay for in Europe which is about twice or three times even you see in some places why because what'll happen if if you raise gas people will figure out how to take public transportation people who take public transportation have about 20% lower mortality than people who drive back and forth to work um so it gets them out from behind their Wheels onto their feet they'll move closer to their schools and their jobs uh there'll be more population concentration so people will be more social and then the last thing is the farm bill a farm bill right now is set up to subsidize soybeans corn sugar beets and wheat these are all the um the inputs of all the junk food we eat the Doritos um you know of uh feed lot animals crappy beef and pork uh if if we pulled those subsidies out and instead of making it easy and cheap to raise these junk food inputs and instead shifted it to beans and Grains and greens and organic vegetables the price of those would come down and the consumption would go up places like Singapore they see very clearly and gas is 11 bucks a gallon and um your car is going to be taxed 300% meanwhile there's a great subway system where it's easy to get any place point A to point B in a safe quick air conditioned way but you got to walk back and forth to the to the subway and people are taking 10,000 steps a day without even thinking about it uh they subsidize brown rice and they're going to tax sugar they already have a sugar tax poor and not coincidentally they tax um tobacco um single before you have a country where the health adjusted life expectancy which is as long the estimate of how long people are going to live minus the years lost to to um chronic disease and the years of healthy life lost to disability that's highest they live about 15 more good years than Americans do heterogeneous society just because they can see clearly and make their policies set policies to f favor the human being rather than to just favor business so if you General reductive advice two or three things get started our like table Stakes or most immediate incremental benefit talk about a 60-year-old talk about a 25y old what are those two or three things like okay I got five minutes with the leading Authority on longevity what are the two or three thing boxes you need to check when you're in your 20s and what about when you're in your 50s or 60s at both ages carefully curate the circle friends that you spend time with we know that if your three best friends are obese there's 150% better chance you'll be overweight so I wouldn't necessarily dump your old unhealthy friends but I would say um making the effort to find two or three new friends in your immediate Social Circle these are people that you're going to see with some frequency or communicate with some frequency whose idea of recreation is biking or golf or pickle ball or gardening uh friends who uh care about you on a bad day that's the real litus test of a real friend with whom you can have meaningful conversation and it's not a bad idea to have a whole food vegan or vegetarian in your immediate Social Circle because they're going to show you how and where to get um healthy uh plant-based food I can't emphasize the importance of that enough if you really want to live longer it's making that shift to whole grains greens beans nuts and tubers it's it's indisputable in my in my view as an extension of that get yourself a good cookbook you know I've written Blue Zone kitchen books but uh there's lots of of cookbook great cookbooks that tell you how to cook show you how to cook plant-based learn how to cook at home uh in instead of going on a diet uh or joining a gym say to yourself well for the next four Sundays I'm going to get my family together and we're going to cook three Whole Food plant-based meals together on Sunday afternoon store them for the rest of the week and eat them and the the trick is to not only uh know where you can get the ingredients know how to make it uh but the trick is to find a handful that you love and once you find that my job is over because at the end of the day people really don't give a crap about the environment they don't care that much about animal cruelty or even their health when it comes to a hungry belly at lunch they want to eat something delicious so as long as you can satisfy that hungry belly uh in a delicious way people don't care that much uh in other words they they'd happily take a healthy meal over unhealthy meal as long as the taste is that good well give us a little bit about your path professionally and what the big breaks were and what advice you would have for a young person who says I would really like to have that guy's professional life like what were the big breaks what do you wish you'd started earlier what skills do you think you brought to the table what advice someone's 25 maybe they enjoy thought leadership or science or they enjoy writing and they want to be they want to be Dan well Heaven helped them they want to be Dan but but um for I would say you know I was an uh intern with George Plimpton who was a editor of the Paris review and a a um uh great WR participatory journalist I'd say number one and I would say for any 25 years learn how to commun communicate not only verbal but written communication skills storytelling it's kind of everything even in an age of AI because being able to write well is a reflection of your ability to think and um and and convey an idea and sell the idea whether you're selling um uh uh stocks and bonds a real estate development idea or in my case longevity so that that is a good base um you know when you were off doing useful and productive things going to school and analyzing uh fixed instrument financial instruments I wouldn't roll my bike I I I I hold the the record for biking from Alaska to Argentina biking around the world and biking the length and width of Africa that's what I did my most of my 20s which was actually very good Training for life because you develop discipline you develop a sort of empathy for other cultures and a sensitivity also an ability to to uh survive and to um quickly learn synthesize lots of information and put it to work uh then I started a company uh I was writing well I was trying to write for National Geographic that was my Holy Grail and I kept getting getting rejected but my editor said you know everybody likes your bike rides around here but the new Expeditions have to add to the body of knowledge or somehow illuminate The Human Condition and at the time this capability to interact online was coming into into um Coming online and I developed a way of solving ancient Mysteries by letting an online audience direct a team of experts uh to solve these Mysteries and I took teams of 10 12 people into uh Central America to find try to figure out why the ancient Maya civilization collapsed and across China following Mar Marco Polo's route but we were connected to uh a million or so people and we harnessed the wisdom of the Crow and those became very successful and uh I all of a sudden at a company which I sold eventually to hardcore brace a uh Textbook Company and that you know I made money doing that I I made money not because I was pursuing the dollars the dollars was a byproduct of something I I've freaking loved which is so uh Expeditions and solving Mysteries and then I sold that company and uh now had a a capacity for networking to top experts and National Geographic like me and and I got this cover story assignment to unravel the mysteries of longevity but you know like you Scott I I think if if I would have asked the 20-year-old Scott Galloway uh to chart his career to the heights you are right now you might have gotten a year or two into it before everything fell apart and um I I'm I'm pretty much the same way you know i' had lots of failures but learned from my bike ride the that they're not that bad in the context of what you know African villagers are going through and yeah tomorrow when I get on my bike it'll be a new adventure metaphorically and I'll figure that out when I get there Dan Butner is a National Geographic fellow longevity researcher and award-winning journalist he's also the New York Times best selling author of several books including the blue zones lessons for living longer from the people who've lived the longest and Thrive finding happiness the blue zones way also Dan is a three times Guinness World Record holder for distance cycling yeah that's a that's a flex anyways Dan this whole Space has just blown up and you genuinely are the OG here you were in this before it was cool and kind of forged a category that's created so much attention I think so much good living so much longevity and quite frankly so much economic value I think any any the you know the huberman lamb or Peter ATA I feel as if they should all send you royalty checks because you were sort of you kind of paved the way here it was really nice getting getting to spend some time with you and congratulations on all your success thank you Scott and I'm thinking my of yours as well I I if I had a Blue Zone star I'd lick it and put it on your forehead because uh thanks I think I'm going to see when you're 100 I hope so brother I hope so
