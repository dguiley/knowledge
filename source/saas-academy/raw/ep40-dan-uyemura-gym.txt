I think you have to be sick to be a founder and I've got this belief that for every successful business there was a moment where you were 5 minutes away from hanging it up and you're smiling like most Founders do when I ask this question what's that moment for you I think it was in 2017 I remember having a conversation with my co-founders Brian and Chris and I was like hey guys I just want to let you know I think I'm out this is just too hard we're getting beat down after beat down and we we have just enough clients now where it sucks to close this and I was like I'm pretty sure my gym can make more money than this business I was super convinced I'm like I'm just going to focus on the gym cuz the gym definitely has a better chance Dan WEA founder CEO of push press welcome to the Pod man super excited to have you on thanks for having me uh I'm sure we'll talk about it but we go way back so it's always good to chat with uh you and my buddy I mean let's start there dude so we we were kind of coming up in the fitness software space in the same time and I think uh we've had just like a few Random Encounters knew a lot of the same people right but you know I think we first met in person at a brewery in Baltimore when you were out there for a conference but I don't know man my favorite my favorite set of hang time we we did like a joint company retreat with our two businesses and I think it was 2017 um and uh shared a house I don't know we crammed like 112 people into like a four-bedroom house um days just hanging bootstrap days yeah yeah for sure and uh God it's so funny man just hanging by the pool Talking Shop laptops open whiteboard and stuff figuring out how to integrate products it was uh it was a lot of fun man it was uh it was some good times yeah I mean that's the epitome of bootstrapping right like just get people together any way you can and just brainstorm the best products you can as fast as you can get to Market that's what we're doing yeah man it's super cool um so I would love to know you know I always laugh um when I think about our early days kind of alongside one another because we used to do Zoom calls you know catching up and whatnot when you were running the business out of the gym and I remember every time I don't remember what day it was but you always be like oh sorry it's deadlift day because we be talking on zoom and it just be like Bam Bam just like deadlifts going it's like humble beginnings bootstrapped company you know I think that you are the classic story of somebody who is in an industry that's not software right I mean you running the gym and saw this problem or this Gap in the market and weren't satisfied with any of the solutions out there and you did what any entrepreneurial person does and went and built the thing so I'd love to just you know set context for the people listening what's uh what's the origin story of push press I mean you've gone from that to eight figures and Beyond man it's been a wild ride yeah um I mean I guess I had an upper upper hand in it in the fact that I was a internet engineer as a career I burnt out I burnt out of basically just sitting at a desk coding I was working for a bunch of companies I didn't really believe in the product I was building so it was kind of whack like I would just show up every day write some code go home or somewhere in that journey I found CrossFit and so I would show up every day write some code get pissed off that they held a meeting at 4:30 pm when at my five five o'clock CrossFit class is about to kick off and then eventually I was just like I'm kind of done done being a Cod I got laid off I was working at Myspace of all places let me date myself not a gray hair I was working at Myspace I got laid off because they were doing typical PE stuff where they were like restructuring the company and trying to sell it to someone else and put lipstick on a pig and anyway I got laid off took my Severance because I got a severance and decided to open a gym when I opened the gym uh I realized two things one gym owners need not only needed a lot of help but we were getting ripped off so I while I was um still at my space I was negotiating a payments rate for this gym with the payment provider company that was attached to the software I was looking to use and I spent about a month of my life negotiating this payments rate got it down to 1.9% super stoked about three months later one of my initial members came in who was a banker I was bragging about it to him because that's what we do and uh he told me it was impossible that there was no way I was paying 1.9% it it was just not phys not possible unless I was like doing card present transactions which I wasn't he took my bank statement analyzed it and he realized I was we realized I was paying 4.8 in effect and so I and then I started asking other gym owners and they were all in the same boat so I realized like this salesperson who had way more information and was better at sales than me ripped me off and no no one was the wiser and it was happening to probably thousands of other gym owners out there concurrently nobody knew so that that was one one realization I had which really really pissed me off second realization I had was like because I built software I knew all the software solutions that were in play at the time were woefully far apart from what I knew could be built uh and so I kind of took those two things and married them together and said hey why don't we try and build the software uh we took about a year and a half threw away like three different versions of the code and ended up launching our first version of push press with my second Gym which was torren training lab in Torrance California so that's kind of what year was that did push press come to Market just kind of 2013 the picture 2013 cool I love it and so you launched from there it was you Chris what was the team when you guys went to went to Market a handful Brian Brian was the banker ironically who pointed that out yeah oh got it I remember uh man I remember we were playing top top golf uh talking shop um when Brian was there that's cool and so so fast forward today 11 years later now as we're recording this podcast I mean you know whatever you're comfortable sharing but like I mean you guys are above a figures and revenue you got a whole Suite of products like what's the rise been for you guys um I mean it's been the typical bootstrap Journey if you're out there on the bootstrap Journey you know it's like a a ton of grind in the beginning it's so hard to build the momentum you need to get to Market um it always feels like you're you're rounding third and then you realize you're still at home plate like trying to get a bat off your shoulder I mean this probably resonates with you and everyone else listening but there are so many times where we're like well when we get to half a million in Revenue we're going to be good oh no when we get to a million in Revenue we'll be good oh we did the numbers when we get to three million in Revenue we'll be able to hire the people we need to be good and it just never stops I mean I'm still there today um so yeah I mean growth you know growth in the early years was like 100 200% a year but what is what is 200% when you have like 10 clients like who you know who knows but it's hard it's hard I tell a lot of you know people starting businesses now it's like you're basically going to get punched in the face every day like you're you're in the ring against Max Holloway and you don't you you haven't even trained never fall before so it's like you're [ __ ] lucky you can block a punch in the beginning and then eventually you'll start to learn how to like at least throw a punch and then maybe you like might Land one and then 10 years in you might be able to like actually compete that's the type of grind I think you've got to be willing to do to get into a business because it's very competitive and it and and not just against your competitor competitors but winning customers and and satisfying customers is is the game and it's hard it's a hard thing to do I want to double click on that for a second about the uh about the grit or the staying power you know Dan I've got this belief that for every successful business there was a moment where you were 5 minutes away from hanging it up and being like yo I'm out this is too much um and you're smiling like most Founders do when I ask this question what's that moment for you dude is so it's so ridiculous in hindsight but I think it was in 2017 I remember having a conversation with my co-founders Brian and Chris and I was like Hey guys let want to let you know I think I'm out I think I'm out this is this is just too hard um you know it's like we're getting beat down after beat down and we we have just enough clients now where it sucks to close this like we had probably had like 300 clients and it's like not enough to really make money but just enough where you're like closing this is gonna suck and I was like because I'm pretty sure my gym can make more money than this business so I think I'm gonna focus on the gym which nowadays makes me laugh so much but I was super convinced I'm like I'm just going to focus on the gym because the gym definitely has a better chance than the software company but they didn't let me thank God so and what was like what was behind it what was like what led up to that man it's just you know again getting momentum is hard and it's like in the early days you might win a client that's great it's an emotional roller coaster it's like you win a client you're stoked and then three other clients are like pissed off punching you in the face or you lose a deal to someone else or you know it's just like in there not even in the early days just the way buiness what I've what I've learned now is the way business works is it's just a series of loss and and if you're customer like customer Obsessed the more customer obsessed you are the more you're going to lose because people any pain point someone has you're going to feel personally and I'm customer obsessed so it was like we might have done one thing right but we had 99 things we we had as a problem and then two things right in 98 and you just slowly start to make that 5050 but there's still 50 50% of the things people are not happy about to this day like I think we have a decade worth of product to build still like I just like it's just end in sight the difference now is like I realize that there's no end in sight and I'm not trying to you know it's like you play the game differently when you realize like I'm never gonna wake up and have a great day like there's always it goes back to what you said earlier right where it's like oh when I get to this Revenue level or this headcount or this feature or this product I'll be good it's just forever yeah I bet you if you ask like well Bezos doesn't run the company today but you know if you ask Bezos when he was still running the company the day before he quit he probably had a a laundry list of things he needed to do to feel like he actually had the company going at that point they're probably already had you know billions in Revenue so it just never is going to end yeah and and in a few minutes I want to get super specific on kind of how you look at those but but there's something I want to hit before that man because you know I'm a big believer in in the law of the lid right like the company's never going to grow faster than you grow and and you tweeted something a while back um about how the the guys at your VC firm um who did your series a they really Revere Warren Buffett right and you asked them how you can dig deeper and they were like just read the shareholders letters and you had this this point you were making about how it's amazing to you how simple the answers are and how much wisdom is in the world and it doesn't always cost you anything you just have to be curious and carve out the time to go learn it and I thought that was a really cool Insight I'm curious like when you look back at who you were in 2017 when you know Chris and Brian pulled you back from the from the brink of hanging it up and push press right who did you need to become in order to be the guy now who's CEO in this company today man that's a good question I've literally probably gone through three metamorphosis then since then at least and I'm in the process of doing another one right now that's tell us more yeah so I mean the reality is is like going from zero to one requires passion grit determination running through walls like just doing anything you can to get to one and I'm not talking in any Revenue terms just like Zer you know yeah first product I have a product that exists like yeah I've arrived and I guess we could break it down into different different phases right zero to one first customer right like it it took a year and a half of writing code uh from first customer to a thousand customers you've got to go from like you've got to actually put on a Salesman hat you've got to like put on a marketing hat you got to do now you have to do all of these things to actually get business to work and listen to customers and build functionality and do all these things like you're doing everything there's not enough hours in the day to get from like I don't know a thousand to 3,000 customers for for us right now you got to become a team Builder and a leader and you've got to learn how to allocate capital and you got to learn about unit economics and business models right and there's just so much more there and like the next journey of mine is like how do you build a machine uh a machine where there's an input and an output and it's all mathematically determined how do you do how do you Foster operational excellence how do you do annual planning how do you think of A Five-Year Plan like now it's like I'm not thinking it personally before I would thinking like minutes and then it'll be like days weeks quarters then you're thinking annually and now it's like I can't even think annually like I'm already focused on 20126 at this point you know 2025 is already burnt and spent like we've already got 2025 in the books and it's like how do you plan 2026 and 2027 and like I'm steering on such a big trajectory it's like I've got to start steering now to get 2020 going so I've got to know where I want to get in 2027 to know where 20 you know it's like you're starting to think in like in in three to five year chunks which is crazy so yeah and it's such a it's such a massive step change I think from where so many entrepreneurs are because I I guarantee you there's a thousand people listening to this who are just like that sounds neat but I'm trying to make it to Tuesday yes right minutes beginning right yeah and and that's the right thing to do you have to you have to be so Nimble and this is where you know companies and we could talk about later but you know where companies start to fail when they get to our stage is like you become too slow to make the turn so you've got to you've got to build into your business the mechanism to be nimble and agile and responsive to the markets and your customers but at the same time you're thinking far enough ahead where you're you're able to get the big the big steers happening early enough yeah so no I want to talk about that man so so you're saying that one of the most important things as you become a big business is to make sure that you are still Nimble enough to adapt to the market and make quick decision or El you're going to get clipped by a startup if not totally but how like how do you build that into your into the company yeah so I for for us personally the way I'm I'm approaching it is trying to build a Bottoms Up company so giving and this is where like my my big steers are setting framework right so what is the objective of 2025 it has to be super clear it has to be understandable and has to be measurable but then I'm not telling them what to do other than like in 2025 we need to do this like I want to see customers happier I want to see logos increase in different verticals whatever it might be like you give them the guard rails and then you build the operational um processes and Facilities so that it's like figure it out I I don't know how you're going to do it but that's what we want to do and what you end up what you end up um at at this stage what you end up like attracting are problem solvers like I don't know if they're entrepreneurs or whatever but basically highly curious people who who have customer empathy and want to solve problems they're like okay the big picture for the company is to do X I work on the mobile team specifically the members app the mobile team and and my contribution to X will be to do this thing I'm gonna go research it I'm G to go figure out what kpi I'm measured against I'm going to figure out like the mechanisms for building this I might have to figure out the resources I need and then I'll write a pitch for that and I'll present that to the executives and they'll approve it or not or they'll question things and refine it with me and then I'll have Clarity on what I need to do in 2025 and I'll build the team in Q4 and then we'll 2025 we're off and running but that's how you can stay Nimble enough because you're all you're empowering all the little micro divisions in your team to figure out what the market wants what the customer wants and how that aligns with what the company needs yeah dude I love that and and I'm I'm curious how do you build the environment where someone who's entrepreneurial enough to come up with a pitch for a product idea like how do you make them want to build it with you I mean I think a lot of Highly creative people and highly passionate ambitious people are looking for like agency and autonomy so they're looking for the ability to attach well so one thing that's cool about my company specifically is 10 to 20% of the population identify as a fitness person so it's like you're tapping into some intrinsic like passion that they have I want to make the world fitter with me you're one you're one of them right so that's the first part is like I believe in what we're building and then and then you just got to build systems and and the Frameworks within your business to say like you you you believe in what we're building I don't have to sell you on like what tomorrow looks like like to be honest when I worked at like I worked at a Pinterest Agency for a while I don't think I ever bought into like where they wanted to go I'm like I just don't care I'm just here to make money right so we eliminate that from the start it's like missionaries not mercenaries from the get-go which means you have to have your core values established you have to have your mission your vision your values and like where you want where you're going with very clear so that when you're hiring people you're weeding people out against like do align with this for example Fitness is one for us the other one for us that I will I will interview against and try and root out against is like do you believe in the little guy or do you like the big guy give me an example right like did your mom own a laundromat did your dad own a restaurant you know like did was he did he get pushed out of town by Chili's right like show me something like that because that's we support the little guy right yeah and just for what it's worth like I can see that like oozing from your marketing from your content from your positioning on on social just when you when you talk when you speak about the industry like it's a lived value for you man I can I can see it from a thousand miles away it's pretty awesome so there's magic in that like if you can actually truly identify and it's okay if your identity is like we're the big guy like it doesn't matter what your identity and your Mission Vision Values are as long as they're they're set and they're stable and and people will be attracted to it and the right people be so anyway that's the first thing and then and then it's about building the process which we're working on now we're not great at it but again like annual planning what is the big picture for the company for the year and then we work that down to the company and then every division is just expected to say like go put on your entrepreneur hat figure it out like what does a customer need that you who do you work with what do they need what are they saying how are they feeling how does that tie into where we want to go right and then what is your proposal on how to how to how to solve that I I think you know that's how you can stay Nimble as a company even though like I'm steering 2027 right now you know we've already know we're like we've set up 2025 in 2026 to start going towards that people can start to build those processes and then yeah got it yeah it's it's it a lot of it comes back to hiring like you've got to hire curious people who who are passionate and high have high potential so let's talk about this product strategy then right because I feel like from what I've seen of your company it's not just innovating within a single product like we mentioned earlier you've got a whole Suite of products at this point and and some of them I felt like like if I put my gym owner hat on they were relatively you know logical and there's a really strong value prop but if I have my software hat like the guy who does the billing platform it's a non-obvious play to for instance offer gym insurance right and you know I'm curious like first off what is your your vision for the industry you're talking about thinking big you know three to five year you know plans like what's your vision for the fitness industry overall and your role in it and then I want to talk a little bit about your strategy with the products you're launching vision for the fitness industry in general and this isn't Fitness specific this is I think all vertical SAS that are SMD focused which is us so if you're watching this and that's you this is this is the this is the understood Playbook today but this is not the understood Playbook when me and Matt were hanging out in Vegas trying to figure out what the [ __ ] to build um the bottom line is this small businesses do not want to have more relationships they prefer less relationships over more um and they are highly loyal to the relationships that they trust so our mission is to establish trust by building value towards our customers and caring about them more than they care about themselves um when you establish that trust you you earn the right to solve all their problems and the beauty about being in the the center of what they do we are the operating system for a gym is we can solve their problems with more efficiency in in a way that's uh generally provides more value at a cheaper price because we have their core data we understand them better than anyone else um and which means we can usually sell it at a price that's cheaper than any anyone else can do so you can create this uh perfect I don't know if it's Trifecta I haven't really worked this out in my brain but the bottom line is like because we know them better than anyone else because we have the data that backs up how we know them um and because we truly are passionate about their success like most the things line up we can sell them all the services that they need in a way that protects them better than a than an outside company would you know has their interest more at heart is usually at a cheaper price and provides more value because you have 1 plus one plus equals three type economies happening all over the place that's the vertical SAS Playbook that we are executing right now I love it and there's some Nuance in the sequencing that I want to just shine a light on and we'll talk about your specific strategy as we get into this but but it was build the operating system first right build the system of record first and in the JY case it was billing I think it's a pretty accurate statement to say it's usually where the transaction happens you've got to be able to close the ROI Loop and work your way out from there and so what you're saying correct me if I'm wrong is that the vertical SAS playay build the OS get the actual like workflow management and transaction stuff figured out and that lets you be more efficient in building on Like the quote unquote bolt-on additional products that layer on top of the platform is that kind of the right methodology yeah you want to be the center The Hub of the the relationship with that customer and usually that does tie into the billing or whatever their Core Business it's really whatever their Core Business motions are and that and in most businesses that includes a payments stack cool and so we're shooting this podcast in 2024 what are the other things outside of the core billing platform that you offer now I know a few of them but like just lay out the product Suite that push press has today yeah and I you know I'll preface this and say like in hindsight we look genius doing this but uh we really just let the market pull us and I think this is a very good uh topic for entrepreneurs to tie into it's like let the market pull you right yeah you guys were the reason we had to build grow because when you sold when you sold to our competitor like we had a nice thing going and when you guys and sugar wad sold our competitor we realized really quickly like we have to build a a competitor to up launch now and we have to build a competitor to Sugar wad we have to because the market demanded it they people weren't going to buy a software stack if it didn't have all three because we started it us three and then when daxo bought you like now they had it right so it was like very smart for them to do but it forced us to build grow which is our which was our up launch uh competitor and train we we acquired train because of sugarwood um that was a pull right we got pulled into that yeah um branded app was really just an an idea that Chris MC conii had because he was so infatuated with brand and our Theory this is so this is interesting of like Lear learning as an entrepreneur our Theory with branded app and branded app is a is a custom mobile app that is branded to the gym our theory was like 10 people were gonna buy it but he just really wanted to do it because he was super into brand sure um and he's great at it also he's great at it and you know in hindsight it was a stupid thing to do for our business because we didn't do any research we didn't have any we didn't have conviction we just like oh 10 people will do it who cares let's just do it it was like the really the dumbest thing to do but uh I think think I think as it as we stand right now almost 40% of our clients have a branded app which is unbelievably insane like we far out just just beat everything we ever thought it would do um so that's what branded app is and then now we're starting to sell insurance and insurance is really the Playbook of testing the concept of everything I just said can we can we find a product where in the open market it probably is being sold at a higher price point than it needs to that we can sell at at a at a cheaper distribution cost because we have we have the right to sell to our customers because they trust us and we can provide more value in the process of doing so so not only is it cheaper for them but they actually get a better experience better value and that's proving out that's proving out right now so um we've we've that the big Epiphany I had um over the weekend when I was talking to my my partner at the VC was Geico spends $250 a click on Google ads for insurance I haven't spent a penny on insurance other than launching it like I don't I my distribution is baked right into my my platform so it's that's kind of the the beauty of vertical SAS right there yeah dude that's wild um one of the things that's on my mind you know you said let the market pull you which I think is is really good high level advice but I know you well enough to know that there's a probably a more structured way of evaluating product ideas because I bet I could hand you a pen and you could write down 30 more ideas for the fitness industry that you want to build tomorrow right so maybe when you come up with an idea or you know one of your team writes a pitch what's your process for figuring out is this a good opportunity or is it a distraction or how am I going to test for it like how do you think through that as a CEO by and large every idea that gets put in front of me or that someone comes up with is a good idea that's that's the hard part is that's the problem right the hard part is you're you're not going to have a lack of good ideas and I think this is is where to some degree at least being able to say for this quarter you have to pick a a semi- big time frame quarter half or year for this period our focus is X and that X has to be very clear logo growth arpu growth NPS growth whatever right um and when you're able to pick that PIV that that lever or that pivot point is when you could start to make decisions um and sometimes they're hard so I'll give you an example like let's say our our our you know our core thesis is we want to we want to grow logos okay uh I get two proposals we want to do internationalization or we want to build you know three functions that will take us deeper into CrossFit those both could drive logos so now it's like you got to get into the memo and start to say like okay well show me the research how many gyms are you know how many gyms are underserved in South in Korea and Italy versus how many CrossFit gyms are being opened here what is the cost right there's always the cost what is the risk so this is where like we follow a pretty strict Amazon uh memo writing process where it's like if you haven't done the research now like branded app wouldn't fly today given today the work that we put into it but if you haven't put in the work to back up your thesis of why this is the thing that solves our problem point or our our Direction which includes risk analysis cost resources needed to be added you know you know chance of chance of winning things like that then we won't we can't consider it at this point we are we're actually past the point of doing things on gut right um how do you teach that to your team so that's actually we're going through the process of now and it's it's a really rigorous process and difficult to actually go from I feel like this feature is going to do well to um I know this will do well um and it really it does the hardest part about it is it slows down immediate uh you know trajectory of velocity and I think the hardest part what I'm what I'm navigating through right now as we speak is the layers of while you're while you're increasing your velocity on the things you're doing now you're thinking about and writing your memo of the stuff for next year right and that's how you can keep velocity and make good decisions in in the long run so that's kind of like how I'm starting to see it now is like instead of everyone just stopping and writing a memo for six months and like nothing happens you've got to be like multi-layered where you've got a layer of people who can execute now and usually it's the people managing the execution the ic's that are executing they need to be able to step back and go like well Dan what do we want to do in 2025 okay that's the thing then let me start to write the memo for 2025 so I can build the team this is the thing that blew my mind I gu I guess you know in the last 18 months is like you have to build the team in 2024 to do what you want to do in 2025 right and so normally in the entrepreneur Journey it's like you're just doing whatever the hell you're doing right now and you'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow but in order to keep the velocity going it's like you have to have the foresight of knowing where you want to go next year and concurrently build the team that's going to get you there while you're you know while you're moving towards that um I like to think of everything as like military analogy because that's just works for me and it's like if you know you got to go fight this battle over here next year you've got to be training your soldiers today you can't just be like throwing people on the battlefield you know when the battle starts so that's kind of how you gota you got to think of the cycle dude so that's awesome I want to read this one thing back to you that I just got from this conversation because I just think it's really important I think that you know I've talked to a lot of Founders and we're going through this ourselves too where we're trying to we're in the midst of doing like leaning into to a culture of writing right and trying to get the memo process down and trying to get better Clarity of thought and you're right because you know you mention velocity and throughput and staying agile as a larger company on one hand and it feels like it's intention with you know slow down and write memos and think this through and so what I just took from this what I learned is that the velocity is kind of time boxed from today to you know six months down range roughly right where the stuff that's in Flight go fast stay focused ic's are charging ahead the management layers kind of split in their time and the the the clarity the writing the the depth of analysis isn't a now thing the next couple of quarters are already baked and you need to write these memos and do this thought workor for the next half of the year the next year the next two years and so it's like applying the right tactic to the right time Horizon yeah yes exactly and that that's the hard cycle to break out of when you're in the run through walls to do every like try to get till Tuesday phase so that's like as the leader of a company the big reinvent of yourself is that like we're fix we're always paying back some [ __ ] we burned up yesterday like there's that cycle and then there's like really getting ahead of yourself and saying like we need to get 2025 lined up now like we're doing our 2025 annual planning now which you know might even be considered a little bit late we probably should have done it in June but that's because we have to have the plan baked by October so I can hire the team in Q4 and have them on board and ready to go for January 1 right that's that's how we think it that makes a ton of sense man um one of the other things on my list that I wanted to talk to you about with this multi-product strategy because this something that comes up with a lot of our like boardroom clients is you know they they're starting to launch second and third products and they're they're curious about how it works um what's your overall strategy for pricing and packaging the suite like do you sell everything as add-ons do you bundle have you tried both like what's the right way for you to think about pricing once you have a whole bunch of different products in a similar market pricing can be a whole podcast and there's a lot of variant there's a lot of Vari to this a lot of variables um so it really depends on who you serve first of all we serve smbs and from my personal experience snbs are very price sensitive and especially like usage based pricing doesn't work for us um and a lot of like the more they feel nickel and dimed or you know uh you know upsold to the worse so there's that to consider if you're selling in an Enterprise you can probably go usage based you can probably stack a whole bunch of pricing because the the person making the payment is not the person whose bank account it's tied to in the SMB it's like I'm the one paying for this so if I feel like you're nickel and diming me so again vertical SAS is the foundation of vertical SAS is trust so if you create your pricing package in a way that like uh deinen diviz trust you're in the long run you're screwing yourself 100% um so in my business the way we think about it is there are um additional packages you can buy based on value sets that we provide but each one carries uh an increasing discount so it ends up in your brain becoming a package price but everything gets incrementally cheaper as we go and the reason I guess you can say one of the one of the primary drivers that our branded app has like 3 4% adop 40% adoption or whatever is because by the time you get to adding the Branded app it's usually the fourth thing that people will buy I think the Branded app ends up being like 80% off because it's just like that discount Stacks and stacks and stacks and they're like well I guess I'll just get that for like 20 might as well yeah got it um and that wasn't from the intention so much of like trying to jam people into buying more things it's just like we we know when you think of the entire price like I'm buying three things two things or four things and the price just comes to this that's just an easier way for them to like understand the relationship in my opinion pricing should be set so that you're getting at least 5x value de demonstrative 5x value on whatever you're paying that's how you reduce turn have you as you've kind of branched this out I mean obviously your you know overall client value increases the more products um the more products you're selling have you had any tension you've had to manage around just like overall wallet share of your customers like owners being like man I just I'm paying push press a lot of money even though I'm getting all this stuff or um like how have you had to deal with that I think in general that's always going to happen and I think the way you battle that which we don't do great enough yet is you need to provide clear value on the flip side of it so for instance pretend you had a relationship with I don't know Amazon and it's like for whatever reason if you knew okay if you're Prime right if it's like every time Prime renewal comes up you're like who it's one 75 now whatever but then it's like oh yeah but you you watched 18 free movies and you had you know free you had this many shipments come for free and they do the math and it's like well that 175 bucks really was like $4,000 you saved last year that really takes the but like without that $4,000 side of the equation you're like 175 I don't know do I need it so I think that's that in the SAS world that's what you need to do it's like whatever your chart that's why I'm say 5x value right it's like if you're 200 bucks month you better have something that shows them that like you've just saved you saved or gained $1,000 by by spending this $200 you know yeah I think that's like for people designing products or or even if there's earlier stage Founders listening to this and they're still figuring out what product to build it goes back to what you said around like building the the platform system of record first before you start to Branch out in Industry this is a challenge that I had with with up launch in the first company is it was difficult to do what what I now call closing the ROI Loop right when you're doing the transactions like you are in push press you can you can do it very easily because you have a data feed of how much money they're making right and so you can like show the return on investment very very clearly just like the Amazon example if you're building a product where you can't do that or you have to rely on like self-reported data or perception of value it gets to be a lot trickier to overcome the wallet share phenomenon you know um I thought bare metrics did this really well like the um subscription analytics over stripe that I used I used a payment recovery ad- on it was the most expensive part of my barometric subscription they were like look paid us 8,300 bucks and we've gotten you back $68,400 of what we recover or whatever it was and so yeah you're like [ __ ] I just spent 900 bucks and they're like well we recovered 9,000 in Mr for you so figure that out soit right yeah yeah they got you oh I love it man all right um so I want to talk about team for a minute and culture because you know that's something that I've admired about you since the since the startup days when we were you know doing the Retreats together is like the culture always seemed pure and you've talked about that a lot on this podcast right like advocating for the little guys you're hiring people whose you know parents might own laundromats like that kind of thing you put the label on the bottle really really well which is interesting but then I was watching some of your content on Tik Tok and you did a little video about something called the KE test and it stirred up a little uh little Motion in some of your followers that we'll talk about in a sec but but for people who are listening to this and they're not sure what the keeper test is let's start with that can you explain what you were talking about there yeah the bottom the keeper test is something I think Netflix invented basically the bottom line is this it's like uh if you're managing somebody and they come up to you and they go hey I just got another job at insert other company want to thank you for the time here just want to let you know I'm putting in my two weeks and if you're the manager and you go hold up and you go to your boss and say like hey Matt's about to leave like what can we do to like I need a raise I need some stock whatever that that person's a keeper like if you're inclination is like hold up let me fix this what did we do wrong let me fix this that person's a keeper if you're like that sucks have a good time you know like uh it was great working with you and you let them go they're not a keeper like you're probably in the back of your mind going oh cool I can now hire a better replacement of this person that I've been meaning to do for a while and so what Netflix does is they actually surface this in their monthly review cycle with their employees uh I don't know exactly how they do it in fact I don't think they have monthly reviews but there's there's a forced mechanism that makes a manager tell a report you're not a keeper which I think you know Ruffles a lot of feathers like oh great you're going to tell me I'm not a keeper but really you can look at this as half glass full half glass empty and honestly I'll just say this bluntly if you're not a keeper you're going to be offended by that and you know if you're not a keeper like I wasn't a keeper when I worked at my other job because it was like I came in I wrote some code oh well they want to do a meeting I'm pissed off because I want to go home you know like it's all about me I wasn't a keeper and I probably would have been pissed off watching that video at that time because it's like oh like that's really inhumane and you know who res who actually would probably thumbs up that video are Keepers like people who come in headful of fire like want to change the world like super passionate about what we're doing they'll be like hell yeah like I want you to respect me I want you to give me proactive races right like why wait till I quit to give me a raise so that's kind of the keyer test that's why some people were offended by it I don't think that has I actually think if you look at it from a certain lens it is actually more uh empathetic because you're proactively taking care of the best people and you're trying to create systems that reinforce hiring and keeping the best people that's interesting and so you're saying that the people who want to the people who should stay on the bus will be happy to get that feedback and is is there a situation where somebody might not pass the keeper test but can get out of that position and level up that's the whole point of actually talking about it because you're just saying like hey right now you're not a keeper and then the conversation should go then the employee can take it one or two ways oh whoo is me I'm not a keeper this this job sucks right you're not a keeper you're definitely not a keeper or oh [ __ ] what do I need to do like I didn't realize like tell me what I need to do like how can I become a keeper and then it just becomes a really easy conversation for the manager to say like well I just need you to be a little more assertive in meetings I need you to take some more ownership in your projects and like too many bugs yeah right okay let me fix that okay cool like it just creates a a constant so I mean what sucks about the review cycle is like you get no feedback for six months and then it's like well you're like you didn't get a raise and you're up for being fired because you have these problems as opposed to being again it's just a uh pushing the feedback loop faster right yeah that's what I was trying to draw out is is you know there's there's two ways to fail a keeper test right you can I feel like you can fail it on performance which is recoverable I need to fix better bugs show up more assertively meetings or you can fail it based on culture or values which is usually in my experience not a recoverable thing and a lot of that comes down to taking feedback like in your example right there I've seen it put on a matrix youve probably seen this too right where it's like a like the y- AIS is true belief and the x- axis is performance in your role right and and it's like in which area are you deficient because one of those is more recoverable than the other does that resonate yeah absolutely and and again I don't think there's bad people in the world but it's like if you come into my company and you want to you know financially engineer success and like do all these things that are like just go be an ey Banker like or get you know go work for a PE back company that there's nothing wrong with that it's just not how we run this company you know yeah um so like I actually think in in if we want to talk empathy and Humanity like I think that's better for them like find the people who aren't culturally the right fit they shouldn't even be there to begin with because like your hiring process should that out but they get in what's the fastest way to identify that and say like hey look man not a bad person just in fact Martell taught me this it's like you're not a bad person you are a bad fit and we will each be disserving each other for the longer that we let this happen so let's just fix this now you know let me go I'll be we say that all the time right it's like by by by not doing the uncomfortable thing and making the change you need to make team you as the leader are standing in in between that person and a role that they could crush at like you are holding their career back by not being courageous enough to have the convers it was that teaching by Martell that really got me thinking down that path and let me tell you something else I figured out you're F You're really hurting the good employees on your team too because if you're tolerating someone who's like underperforming everyone's going to sync to that level pretty quick so like you have to actually show the team that like this is this is not what we accept here and we want everyone to stay at this high level and not sink to the low levels so yeah it's it's the quickest way to PO like to make a great employee crappy just put him around crappy people I shouldn't use crappy because that's judgmental but put a to make a a great performer underperform you know put them around underperformers yeah and the ones that aren't willing to sync that level we'll just leave and go somewhere else where they can be surrounded by a players so one yeah two outcomes both bad um dude I love that how did you um man like how did you get so clear on the values of push press right did you wake up one morning when it was still getting run out of the gym and you're like these are my core values or has it evolved over time like how do you get where you are the core value thing is such an ironic thing because I think um cerebrally we make it out to be such a big thing and then we go and like look at what other people have written and you know what I mean like we do all this stuff and I've done it too in fact our core values I I'm very uh attached to the way Amazon run their business and a lot of our core values are just Amazon because they've just done it right but the reality is like if you're starting a company and you're trying to do this core value process it really it's it's no more difficult than just saying like what do I believe what kind of company do I want to build like you know and I it's it's tough because we go we keep going back to cliche like oh um the customer is always right or whatever it might be but it's just really you have to just think about what you believe because like I said it's okay to say like the customer is always wrong and want to make a ton of money I mean if that's really what you believe you want those people around you that believe that too right like you don't want bunch of customer empathetic people who like don't want to make money so I think it's it's like you can just strip it down to that like just as simply like if I really had to write down my core beliefs of how I want to run this company because it's your company that's all it is should be any more cont no I agree with you man and I read something somewhere I wish I could remember where I read it so I could attribute it but um it was this idea that a core value is a great core value if the opposite of it could also be true right the example was Facebook's classic you know move fast and break stuff where it could be you know be very meticulous and minimize downtime and that would also be reasonable you know if your core value is like Integrity the inverse of that is like we're all pathological Liars like it's probably a a shitty core value right I never thought about that the way that's really yeah it's an interesting test um cool man so I love it I I got one more big area that I want to get your take on um while we got our time together and it's everybody's favorite topic and sometimes everybody's least favorite topic and it's money um specifically raising money because you've had an interesting journey I think you did a small seed round super super back in the day but you were primarily bootstrapped through the rise of push press all the way through and then recently decided to take on funding and and raise a series a and so I would love love to know we'll talk about the process of that here in a minute but I would love to know first from your perspective as the founder and CEO like what did you believe when you were bootstrapping and what changed to make you switch your approach yeah I mean I will say this from the get-go I tried to raise money the whole time I was bootstrapping I just couldn't uh for a ver for a myriad of reasons which uh we can go into if you want but I couldn't I couldn't raise money was not like literally able to um so my belief all along has been there is enough opportunity in the business we're building there are enough customers who are unsatisfied with the with the companies they work with and my strong desire to be the world's best gym operating system and you know whatever other ANS Services we we build for gyms in a holistically positive way like I want to build a company that actually defends gyms and has their best interest out for them yeah there there's no other there I mean maybe now I could I could argue that there are a few competitors coming up that might have that same mindset when I started this nobody nobody I really believe care about gyms where I was competing against so I knew all along if I if I was able to build the product that could compete or beat those and have the empathy and values that we have we would win we would we would win and it would be better for the customers that we did that's that's why we had to raise because we needed to speed up the ability to that of which we can build product um it was just so slow in the beginning and and the so the you know the reality of it is this is like when you're bootstrapped you have to hire whoever you can hire and what I've learned over the years is if you don't it's better to hire one Rockstar than three non-rock stars like it's better to spend 300 Grand on one person than three times 100 Grand on three people F just to make the math easy I don't know if those are the right numbers but um like hiring hiring many non rock stars put us back years really yeah like just created worst product created landmines right like so we're not doing that anymore and and that's why we raise money because it's just like we have to stop hiring whoever we can afford and start hiring the people that we've handpicked to do the job and who are highly capable so I I think that's a really Salient Point man because I think the people people and I try to coach Founders out of this constantly right where like head count is not a metric that you should I feel like strive to achieve I feel like minimize head count minimum headcount yes minimum viable headcount we're coining that term right now um so right and it's like I think people they look at productivity of employees as this like linear progression right you know where 10 Engineers goes 10 times faster and they they yeah they they fail to realize the communication overhead the management overhead the you know differences that gets created the human drama yeah yeah yep it's uh minimum viable headcount yeah so all right so you just so it wasn't a decision then um that was new it was a decision the whole way and you had to get to the point where you finally could get the round done right like what was what had changed in the business that made you quote unquote fundable at that point and what was that process like raising the money God there are so many Dynamics I think that changed that really all came together one when you have a business that actually has enough clientele and enough Revenue it takes away some question marks some investors and at the seed in the series a around they're investing more in the idea and the pro the premise than they're investing in the machine of the business so we you know we had we had grown through covid that was another proof point is like we went through this crazy moment where all the VCS were like this is UN what is going on and then when when they see companies growing it becomes an immediate attraction Point um I think honestly and if you're again if you're a Founder out looking to raise I think this is a good good point I became fundable like before when okay so we tried to raise in the first eight years my co-founder Chris was the CEO for a while Brian was the CEO for a while I was a CFO for a while it was like we were just like who can do this rotating through the positions um we used to get feedback like uh we like the company we like the idea we don't see the passion and we were like we're so passionate what do you mean but it was like we were scared to pitch so we were like trembly voices timid people like we didn't really have the vision packed out I'm at a I've been at a point now where it's like half of my job is just s staring at a screen and thinking about 2027 you know so it's like if you want to talk about like all the Nuance like I have the models I have the the visual representations like I I know where push press is going now put me in front of an investor or somebody and I will tell them and it becomes inv because it's just like with confidence and and track record this is what we've done this is what we're doing this is how we're going to do it you know this is the vision this is what happens 10 years from now take it or leave it that just like that type of confidence is so different in a pitch than uh we're building like how you gonna beat mind body oh we're not really sure yet there you know like we don't you know like all that [ __ ] so you know if if you're looking to get funded your confidence in the story like like my my chiefest staff told me this Elon Musk will go raise $100 million for a new napkin brand right now because he'll pitch the hell out of it and he's Elon Musk you know like you could have a life-changing revolutionary business but if you don't have that cache behind you you're not raising anything so it's at the end of the day investors are emotional and they inv they they invest in confidence dude I love that and it seems like a a really clear example of flipping the power Dynamic right between the way that I think inexperienced Founders look at this of like asking for permission where I loved what you said about this is my vision 100% confidence I'm going here with or without you take it or leave it right I mean that's a totally different lens yeah and and it's something I honestly you just have to develop over time and it's it's like everything in life it's reps right like eventually you're going to get told no enough that you realize that like oh it's pattern recognition right like I've seen you before you're not a good investor for me so let's just not waste each other's time or versus like you know like once youve once you've done it enough you're just kind of like I I know you're a good investor here's what I do like let's just shake down and get to get to the Brass tax what do you think and uh I think when you approach it that way it's just all of a sudden investors like it's like dating right it's like if you're dating someone they're like uh you know kind of wishy-washy you're just like I don't know but if they're just like yeah I'm I'm I'm a catch and uh if you want to catch this you can but you tell me if not I'll just go over there then all of a sudden you're like oh hold on right so that's funny man and so one of the ways that I think you're different than a lot of the people I talk to is that you have a really high degree of respect and admiration for the VCS who invested in your series a and I don't always see that Dynamic with companies you know there's there's a lot out there about you know uh every investor is a value ad investor blah blah blah and you know I talk to you um overwhelmingly it's you say that it's been a good experience so my question is how did you know when you're pitching all of these different investors trying to raise money for so long yes you became fundable but how did you know that they were the right people to take money from yeah because I mean just to answer that as succinctly as possible all the red flags we got talking to investors which is probably all of the stuff most Founders are afraid of uh it was opposite with this investor and I I do I what I realize now is they're out there they're a little more hidden and they're one in 50 most investors don't fit this profile so here here here's like the uh should I get funded should I not get funded as a Founder conversation if you're operating in a space where like it's Winner Takes all you have to get funded and you have to get funded by a high bet taker which would be Sequoia a a16z uh light speed those kind of guys um those companies want to return the fund on a couple companies and invest all their energy in those couple companies so they want an Uber they want an Airbnb they want a Facebook they want I don't know the next AI company however their risk profile is such that they will burn down all the companies that don't return and by return we're talking like 10 20x plus 50x like Mega return so they're willing to invest in a, companies and have three return and you have to know when you play that game your odds are about 98% that they will burn you down because the only way to really test you got to think of every business is this is their business so in your business it's like how do I get a customer I need to test their response their test is like can this go 50x and so it's like the only way to test that is to burn money and they have all the money in the world to burn so they're like okay go hire a bunch of people burn it and I want in one year I want to see if you can get to here okay cool you did it I'll reinvest right but now you're on this burn hamster wheel anyway that doesn't support my business model my business model is win over 25 years right so I have this concept of durability baked into our business like we have to survive now next year because the the ne the the next partnership might come along or whatever that is the next growth lever that's how I've always seen it when I when I talked to this Investment Company So eventually I'm like hey we got to raise some money because like we can't keep nickel and diming just barely getting product out we have so much to do so I decided to go on the road and see if I can find another investor or an investor when I did it I happened to cross this company called Altos Ventures and um they were just unique like um they were basically pitching me on the concept of durability and responsible Capital allocation and I was like well you don't want me to burn money fast like why would you want to do that like the only way you can die as a company is if you spend all your money so why would you spend all your money and I'm like wait what like yeah like are you guys okay yeah you know they're like no let's just uh test some things with a little bit of money and if it works like then you can double down on it don't just go all in um they showed me like the Power log graph of all their funds right and this is when I thought I was pitching them but I realized is like they were also pitching me I didn't so that's another part of this whole pitch process that you'll understand as you do it more they need you as much as you need them so it's like it's like they're pitching you too so anyways they showed me this graph and it was like they invested in Roblox they were like the first money in the biggest money in I think they invested like 500 million into Roblox before it went public Roblox was like on the graph it was like the whole damn thing right yeah and then there are a couple more that were like really really high and then pretty quickly it like it goes down and and to the left right and in a normal VC it's like anything that was in those first three or four it's like okay just kill those companies and like let's keep putting more money towards Roblox their pitch to me was like um you know these first four over here those are great those returned our funds and then some but you know who we care about we care about all these other companies because that's the founders life work and I'm like they're talk they're talking to me right like I'm like a decade in at this point or like eight years in right right and like that even if we only get 300 million return or 500 million or maybe even a billion return like compared to Roblox nothing who cares right but to that founder that's everything so we don't just burn down those companies because like we don't it it won't really make a a difference in our portfolio but for the founder that's everything and we have a responsibility to every one of those Founders to make sure that we don't kill their companies and we get them to where they need to go to and at that point I'm like sign me up right then they started pitching me like uh inputs and outputs which is like a whole another podcast we can do because that's how I think about life now but they were like re all of the VCS I talked to were like how are you going to double next year how are you going to Triple next year we need revenue revenue revenue they were like Revenue solves itself don't worry about Revenue worry about value how are you going to create more value how do you measure the value you create how are you thinking about that right because if you solve the value end of the equation and you're doing the right things you're going to double you're going to make more money but if all your focus on money is you're going to make all the bad decisions in the short term and you're going to end up like screwing yourself next year so just focus on value so it's like as they're unpacking these gems on me I'm like this is the VC I never thought existed right like they see the world as I see it and uh this can work so thankfully and luckfully like they bought into us as much as we bought into them best partnership ever I am definitely an example of a a company that can Excel with capital behind you that that is aligned alignment is the key you have to be very upfront on like what so now when I'm if I ever raise money I'll ask people what's your expected outcome what would be bad what would be good you know what type of return do you want in what timeline and if they tell me like hey we want 3x return in five years I'm like we're not a good fit because I'm I'm working on this for 10 or 12 years from here at least minimum you know so yeah I love that man I feel like Altos is about to get an influx of people who listen to this episode trying to raise some money they're great that sounds awesome I can make an intro so again all these tips right if you're looking to raise money get an intro from a Founder that they know so if you hit me up I'll take some time to learn your business I'll tell you like not a good Outsource company or is if you're good outour company then I'll pass it along to them and you'll get a meeting but if you just try and cold hit them you probably won't get a meeting because they get 100 cold hits a day yeah yeah that makes sense um I'd love to go backwards for just a sec then on on something that you mentioned you know we talked about all of the good um and all the things that you love about Altos and the way that you guys were Super Value aligned which which I love but you said something before we got to this part which was you know they had none of the red flags that all the other investors that you talked to were and so I'd love to just have you unpack what are the red flags as a Founder that you might see when you're pitching investors well again these are red flags for me so this might not be red flags for everybody depending on your own business like these might be perfectly fine right and I I do think in the winter take all environment uh all of these quote unquote red flags I have are probably valid things to optimize for right so a lot of them did not care about value creation a lot of them did not care about well more than a lot of like all of them except alos so far did not did not care only cared about Revenue production uh many of them zero in on gross margin and profitability I guess predictors right um and so what all that tells me is like they're less worried about how do you actually build a a great business that provides strong value in the in the in the world because I think you can do both you can build a strong business that is also profitable that also has good unit economics that also generates Revenue but when you're focused on those things first it's like you're forgetting about the strong business part right and so to me like I would get into term sheets with people I've turned down multiple term sheets on things and it's like I would get into term sheet people their conversation would immediately turn to like uh let's talk about how you can get 30% Revenue growth next month and I'm like next month like where was that coming from and why do you think that's going to happen like what what the you know and so it's it's like you have to be realistic about what your company is and what you're trying to achieve and what timeline you're trying to achieve it on and just make sure they're aligned with it and these are all red flags for me because I knew I was building a this is gonna be probably my last company I'm not going to build another one you know so it's gonna take some time but the reason I asked specifically is because I I'd venture to guess the majority of Founders who listen to this podcast are more closely aligned from a value standpoint with where you are and your viewpoint on your company versus win or take all I'm going to go build the next Uber not to say and again I agree with you there's nothing wrong with either of those models but I just know our community and our listenership they align a lot more closely with the way you're going about yeah exactly yeah so we're all bootstrappers probably for the most part who could use some Capital um to to grow their business yeah it's like you have to find BCS and honestly I think it's becoming more especially since the downturn in the last year and a half it's more ined now to say like uh we're focused on unit economics and not growth at all cost we're focused on long-term you know grow wealth wealth or growth building with with our portfolio companies that's more in Vogue now the thing to me that's scary is like Altos has been saying that since 1997 consistently non-stop every year and now it's like there's a whole bunch of them saying like oh no no we're worried about you know Capital efficiency and blah blah blah so it's like those companies will just flip right back around to the growth engine when interest rates go down or whatever yeah yeah they're worried about it because they can't be worried about the other thing because of the economy again it's it's what's driving revenue for them so it's like okay we'll go over the revenue is we'll do it like I don't know to me it's just like it's kind of sell your solely right like just do whatever so you know that's that's the thing Altos honam who's one of the main Partners there told me when I was there he's like Warren Buffett's been saying this stuff since he he has a quote where he's like I've been telling everyone to do the same thing since 1950 or whatever every year and then every year people come back to me and say like what what should we do and he's like I've said the same thing every year but everyone wants to go chase Bitcoin or whatever the new hype cycle is and instead just keep doing what I'm doing so it's like it's like the low-key kind of approach to I guess you know the way that they the way that they see investing yeah dude I love it man covered a lot of ground on this podcast from humble beginnings to almost hanging it up product strategy planning in decades culture raising money man we uh we hit it all and I've got a question that I ask to end most of the podcasts that I do but before I do that if people want some more Dan like where do they go to find you and you're doing a lot of content you got push press like where do you live on the internet yeah I think the simplest thing uh push press.com danan believe it or not I have a landing page for myself how uh how funny is that no um that's the best place I I do put out a bunch of content on Tik Tok and Instagram there is links from that page there um I have a smattering of different handles because who can get the same one nowadays so it's probably better just to go there push press.com Dan rock and roll I love it man um and we you are mentioned in our new book that's coming out by the way which is cool have to send you a copy of that we got a yeah we got some push press uh SL Dan action in the book too which will be super fun um but uh cool all right all right final question my friend um if you had to pick one thing what do you want to be remembered for when it's all said and done oh man I think in the end I I would anyone who has interacted with push press as a client or a especially a team member uh just sees me as someone who was just hyper Vigilant and massively passionate about building the best company not only to serve our customer base but our our staff as well um yeah I think it I'm I'm a human to human person that that is reflected in the company and and so it would have to be something along those lines dude well I can tell you as someone who's been watching your growth for quite some time in a lot of different capacities uh it's a big old plus one for me man it comes through in everything you do and I'm uh I'm proud to be able to call you a friend watch you keep on crushing it's been a journey thank you yeah dude I love it thanks for uh sharing some time with us man I appreciate you brother all right me too see you [Music] so
