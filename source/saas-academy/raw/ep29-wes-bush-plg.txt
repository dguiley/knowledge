what up what up guys Johnny paig here and today we've got an absolute treat today we're talking to Wes Bush he's the author of the bestselling book product Le growth and founder of product le.com he's coached over 300 SAS companies and generated over a billion dollars in CER Revenue today we're going to be unpacking all of the different elements of what it truly means to be a product-led software company so let's dive in I'm Johnny pige I'm mle and this is the South Acy podcast here I'd love to hear from you like if if people aren't aren't aware of who you are what you do you want to give us just like the 60 seconds or so rundown on who you are and uh how you got to be doing what you're doing every day yeah so I feel like most people know me as Mr plg I know everything about plg no still learning still a student on it but wrote the book on plg we have the Summits on uh product Le growth and what we also do is over the last kind of eight years just been working with B2B SAS company specifically I've worked with sales L companies product like companies and I remember the first time I launched my uh freemie model this is at vidyard I was like oh my goodness this is it this is like a completely uh new way much better way than what I was currently doing of like uh giving white papers and uh guides and stuff to people to download I was like people just want to try before they buy and and P really embodied that for me so I've been hooked ever since and uh you got a free trial or something I can try love free stuff nice I love wait so were you behind the vidard were you behind the vidyard premium what was the tool that you had for a while um initially viewed it now it's just vidard free yes I loved that tool I used the hell out of that tool I love and it was a fantastic tool for free and and then one day we became very high-paying users uh so worked out really well I didn't realize you were you were the guy behind that very cool yes but I I kind of left out the first part we I was also behind the uh free trial that was not successful well maybe that's a good place for us to start like what did you learn one of the first questions I want to ask you is we hear freemium and free trial tossed around a lot they're not the same thing and I think a lot of people that or a lot of companies that are sales Le think they're doing product Le when they launch one of those too so you have this really awesome article on the website on free trial versus premium and which one's right for you you want to kind of give us the reader digest version of the difference between the two and and how to know which one's the right fit for your company yeah so I'll take like a interesting stance the model doesn't matter at the end of the day it's really like do you understand your ideal user exactly what their user success is like do you know exactly what they're trying to accomplish in their life and then have you kind of bundled it down into to three main groups of like these beginner problems like everybody struggles with that stuff uh then there's the more intermediate problems like most of the market struggles with that uh but it's slightly nuanced still and then there's the advanced problems like really complicated stuff so the advanced is usually like hey that's still sales Le or you got to talk to us or something like that um some level of service there and then there's like in between the intermediate stuff that's really hopefully what um people can first start off with with their initial plan and then beginner stuff all those beginner problems that's your free stuff so however you can unpack it whether that's a free trial often times it's not it's like he takes people longer to experience that value or accomplish that beginner Milestone and so um what we do is we get clear on like what is that beginner Milestone that first strike where they feel like uh I call it like does your premodel pass the Super Mario test or like you pick up that little flower you're like whoa I'm bigger I fire like I love it I love it that's the best for model and I was like if you can't pass that it's not a good free model and so you kind of work from there and then figure out okay which model makes the most sense so that's how we kind of think through it sweet okay so it doesn't matter it's also not just because you've got a product and you launch a premium or a free trial doesn't make you product Le help unpack the you get this beautiful image on the website I'd encourage you if you're listening go to product.com and check it out it's right on the homeage page you have a picture of an iceberg that like that's what most people think product Le is what is it really unpack the other the five other components of what it means to be product L yeah I can even share like the the first video experience too with that free chop because it has directly into it so um when I was at bidard we launched this free trial because I mean everybody else was having one we're like oh yeah let's do that too sounds great um so one of our competitors bre Co they had like a free trial we're like oh let's do that too and so we we just on this 14-day free trial and that we created the new offer landing page all that stuff directed a lot of traffic to it we found a lot of people signed up for this thing this is what they want but then when it came time to look at the conversion rate it's like no no that can't be it like oh no like it's a month in this thing's really not working we're we're blowing money into this free Tri like what the heck is going on the sales teams then there're like waiting you're can we talk to these people please and like sure enough they did they reached out and like the only people that closed the ones that sales talked to so we're like plg didn't work um why was that and it's really like the top of the iceberg most people just focus on like your model and then your offer so what did you promise people and then the overall pricing like okay we got to make that transparent and so um when you just focus on like those like really top level things um that's actually what the problem is is we didn't think about how do we support plg from the rest of the organization and so um we were just slapping on a a free trap and didn't have any kind of support to to make it successful interesting so what what what was the turn that made it so first one bombs sales team closes comes in and plays Cleanup Crew like how did you what was the second iteration yeah so we had like at least one good learning from that which was nobody was uploading a video and so we're like huh it's kind of weird I mean it's like 2017 it's not that easy to create a video but in order to see the value in video it was like you literally had to upload a video put on your marketing site direct traffic to it integrate it with your uh like maretto or you know Big Marketing automation platform and so it was a big ask and so we had to make that like Loop really easy and so we decided okay we gotta have a Chrome extension make it easy for somebody to like click okay good I'm recording myself send it anybody and then they could get a little notification that said wow Johnny paage you watched 50% of my video what the heck why didn't you watch the other 50% but it was cool and at the same time and they kind of fed that Viral Loop and so um that was like one of the things understanding what we're giving away for free we were soling a beginner problem you see we just slapped on the free trial solving the intermediate stuff and when you do that that's where you start to see like that's a a really um hard thing to do it's kind of like I know you both are into like working out and stuff it's like giving somebody the first day is like hey go run a marathon will you it's like no no no no that does not end off well like start with the 5K or like start with the kilometer or something like that that's the ideal free motion is like start something easy at the end of the day Wes do you have other examples of clients you've worked with or products you've worked on like let's let's we got the vidyard example it's a beautiful one I think there's you know be a lot of people that remember seeing that viewed it coming out as as an early tool are there some others that we can um use to use as examples of this you know starting with the beginner problem totally yeah um and so for I'll think of one where it's like wasn't that good of experience so I was recently looking for companies that were recently acquired by private equity and I was like oh I found a about pitchbook and then they had a free trial and I was like oh great let's sign up for the free trial and it's literally just the sales call it's like okay can we talk to you can we go through the I'm like no actually not that interested I wanted to see the data and whatever um but it wasn't like that critical for me to to kind of go in and look at that so that was something where I was like you know what that uh wasn't really solving the beginner problem like they could have solve that with like literally uh just like hey give me the top 10 or something like that top five uh solving that beginner problem just enough to to peque that Curiosity of what that looks like for for me on that end so yeah when you unbundle it that way it becomes a bit easier to unpack that value does it oh go ahead go ahead Matt no I was just goingon to say I'm taking like a really interesting lesson from this conversation right now because I tend to look at things as you know the go to market strategy first right and so I'm I'm thinking through you're telling the vidyard story and like my mind is screaming about like well what was the annual contract value how did you talk to the sales team like was there a mismatch between the free trial strategy and the the price point and I know pricing strategy is one of the things but but I think your point is is very very potent I just want to call it out for the people listening that and correct with I'm wrong but like the the first problem you solved wasn't a pricing problem to fix the motion it was a product problem and you you you said very casually some really really meaty stuff in there like all we had to do was change how the entire first experience of vidyard worked and all of a sudden product lead worked right you know and so I think that there's just so many Founders out there that look at this is just how do I open the front door and let some people in and my product's pretty good and it'll work with and they're underestimated like the product changes right the depth of this work that will actually matter my question is is there still a correlation between like the ticket price of the software and will plg work because I always correlated as like low ACV works for product Le growth like how is it just a product problem or is there a correlation between like your annual contract value and running the strategy also i' actually think like take a a step back too and like back to that Iceberg where it's like okay at the top level most people focus on those three things your model offer um overall kind of experience everything below the surface is actually where the the magic happens and so like that second time what the difference was and this will get back to the the pricing and everything else is um we didn't connect it to the overall strategy of how our company was going to win and so at that time it's like okay it's hard to make a video how do we make that easy how do we create a bio product it's like okay absolutely that product would fit into that um we didn't have the right team that had the capability to do this really really well so we had to hire a new team go through that and build that out that they really understood this um the data we didn't have the right data to understand it's like you know what we are people dropping off we had no idea the first time like what was going on the growth process we didn't actually launch any experiments once it was launched to improve that overall experience the onboarding everything else the pricing the upgrades um so of course it was just kind of stagnant it didn't work and then all of those things um are kind of what I called the product that organization that support this and so your plg motion will only become as strong as your product that organization and so it's really the the yin to the Yang kind of thing if you will on that end and so how it relates to the the ACV and everything else it's like you there's so many examples of product like companies where it could start off with like a $50 per month plan and it scales up to Million Dollar Plus contracts like when we were working with Boomie it was exactly that their CE is like you know what we're going to have a $50 per month plan and like they're $4 billion doll company it's like okay that's for them that was like really low and uh so then it's like but you know these can scale up to massive companies uh that's or acbs on that end yeah because that was a big part I remember uh I don't know why I remember this but I remember I was reading the S1 when Zoom went public right and they said um like 55% of their 100K and higher uh accounts right uh came from single user free you know accounts and so yeah I think it's a it's just an interesting point to call out right in the beginning as people are listening to this they're like oh I'm I should try this free trial thing like it's not a thing I feel like it's it's an organizational DNA thing is is I feel like what you're what you're saying here you to change a lot yeah yeah yeah because it's like the the team the capabilities they all have to support that too yeah for sure yeah let's let's get into that I want to put a bow on the first piece if you're not a product-led company right now it sounded like the question you can ask yourself to to decide whether or not there's an opportunity here and we'll unpack the rest of the decisions but the first one is is the problem I'm solving is there a beginner version an intermediate version and an expert version and could I put the beginner version into something where if they use it they become the Super Mario they take the flower it gets bigger it delivers value so it's small problem beginner problem Big Value that gets them moving up the the ladder um did am I putting that correctly yeah no absolutely and like if you realize like you have that free model or something like that you're like oh it's really hard for people to get started I call that like the cold start problem like that was us the first example with our free trial with a complicated marketing automation solution and it's like you want to go from cold start to like fast start what does that look like for people to quickly get started quickly get value um and solve those beginner problems because they're a lot easier to solve at the end of the day and it's it's probably is it more common that it's actually another version of your product it's not the existing product because like you viewed it had to be it was a whole new Chrome extension and and armor the software it wasn't like you just repackaged or turned off some features of the the the main product this was something specifically designed to solve the beginner problem is that the is that more common or is that the exception to the rule I would actually say it's more of the exception to the rule um and maybe like for companies that are around like the six to kind of 50 mil range where you're like hey you know what we have this successful thing going uh let's not like rock the ship our core product and uh you know wreck havoc if you will but yeah for earlier stage companies it's usually just like you got to tweak some things and understand what that will look like it's usually for the bigger companies where you're like yeah actually we should probably launch something a bit smaller or if you have complicated Enterprise Tech it's like let's take that thing and put it down um because that is solving more of the beginner problem but that's usually rarely the case because the Enterprise problems are the more complicated ones to solve anyways all right I I got a a limiting belief potentially that yes you'd hear that would say there's real risk and that you solve the beginner problem and they never move up to go do the intermediate or you've taken what used to be a 10K per year ACV high or even higher than that and now we're solving it for you know one or two UK how do you make sure you don't cannibalize your core offer when you're trying to explore and or become a product that organization yeah first off I I will say there is something thats like I call it like the free Frontier where it's like the zone of non- monetization ands in every industry in space it always grows every single year grows again and again so for us a product Le is like hey product Le growth fundamentals like I do not want to monetize that like please I will give you everything you need to understand the fundamentals because that is like beginner of a beginner problem uh just get to know what plg is please and like you won't even bother like paying us or whatever it's like we'll give you the best stuff for that because that's a like preset of a beginner prom and so yes there is instances like that where like that is always growing every single year in the industry where you just have to give more more away for free in that sense uh but then how do you connect to it's like okay we don't just want to have freeloaders all the time uh in our product ends so the number one way we found that helps people avoid that problem is just Clarity on what is that kind of First Strike first value in your product that you could give them that effect where was like you know what they're they're feeling like they're they're accomplishing more they're doing something really powerful that they couldn't do before um but it's not the full thing um I I'll give you an example here with Evernote so I was using evernote's free plan for years my only use case is I have it open I journal in it every day and I didn't need all the fancy bells and whistles features they have shown me probably thousands did you not thousands of little 50% off here Wes you can upgrade your dashboard and make it all cute I was like I don't care um the notes work great but as soon as they gated the number of notes I could take they they capped it at 50 I was like oh I'm a sucker there's no way I am up well actually no I upgraded right away but I was like there's no way I'm exporting this to anything else because I'm like I am stuck like there there is no tomorrow here where I'm not upgrading so um that's an example where it's like they understood the exact range where it's like by 50 notes you should get a habit with using our product you should understand this um maybe for some people it's earlier but others that's kind of the the range you look for so it's just enough values not too much not too low got it go ahead Matt I was going to say I feel like I've had that same experience with a different software I feel like HubSpot is world class at this and it's just one of those things it's like that it's like you know game recognized game sometimes like I just I see everything we do in HubSpot and then I see them just get us on something and it just makes me laugh and I'm like you know what guys well done you know there's there's another thing there and it's like when you when you nail the all the different usage based drivers and everything like that you finally find that one where it's like Wes bush is not going to write his 51st note without putting in credit card number first yeah it's a it's a wild thing man it's uh I just how do you like how do you walk people through figuring that out because I think like to Johnny's point I have a similar belief like my whole worldview on product Le which I would love for you to take out a sledgehammer and break to pieces on this podcast is like it's incredibly powerful but you've got to be really surgical about the decisions you make or if you're not it's a really great way to just light a whole bunch of money on fire and mess up your business if you don't do it right so like H how do you walk people through like figuring out their version of the 50 note cap and Evernote you know like what's the right product decisions and how do you coach people who are early stage to figure out the thresholds especially if they don't have a ton of data yet like how do they how do they do that yeah so first I'll start off with a quote I love from Rob Walling he was like premium is like a samurai sword if you don't know what you're doing you can chop your arm off pretty easily and I love it because it's like it is true like I've seen on the other Spectrum it's like too many people give away way too much and then they're like why why are people not upgrading and then I've see it's always like too much or too little then they're like oh we're going to give them a three-day free trial or like and I'm like and how long does it take to get to Value there they're like oh it takes forever but we want them to click around and I'm like that's not tangible value that is no Super Mario test there right they are signing up and being the exact same person um so no transformation there whatsoever so that is the the key it's like does it provide a a simple transformation or a new habit for some of those products so if it's like a habit forming product like an Evernote or something like that it's like okay we we have to develop that habit and and have this go and also the slight Nuance here to kind of consider is what is your goal as a company like if you're Venture back and you're like hey we just want to um grow super super fast like vidard and Loom are going like neck and neck with a video uh free kind of tool and it's like they both had these terrible in my mind uh free model because it was just like you gave everything away for free um and they didn't have much incentive to upgrade until they CED like 25 videos and then that was like enough where I'm like okay I'm getting used to the value here this feels right and so I would always just like yes find exactly what is that transformation you want but if your goal is viral growth and you have a product that can grow that way um then you might just want to loosen the Rings and be like it's intentionally free and we're intentionally trying to just go after and grab the majority of the market while we can at that stage interesting so I've heard you there's so you mentioned there's there's two vectors now to one would be the um the volume of use so usage 25 notes 25 videos Etc the I think the one the obvious one is feature set right so you mentioned the Evernote version of of trying to say hey organize your dashboard is there another outside of like the features and the frequency of use is there another one that like that you uh a lens to think through that would create the overall kind of like usage those are the like main two ones the other one is time that's like the the most kind of basic one it's like how long do you have to do this um and you can mix and match these uh usually what I would recommend if you're early stage like please don't don't be cute uh when it comes to just mixing and matching and oh yeah let's do a reverse trial it's like uh usually companies at like some scale do that and it it does work but uh don't try and just do something crazy when you're just still learning the basics yeah well if you seen a company accidentally change their ICP when they launch product lead oh even worse I see a lot of companies launch the plg motion without knowing they have a new ICP using that product and then they're wondering why are we not attracting the right people because usually when they're more sales Le they they would know their ideal buyer I hope knock on would and then it's it's like when you launch your product lead motion you just don't understand who your ideal user is and it's not the same person not always at least especially in B2B it's like your ideal user could be somebody completely different than that coo or somebody that like actually signs off and they're like oh yeah let's use that tool and roll it out to the entire company okay guys so how do you how do you so you're saying actually the default assumption should be that you are changing your IP and Define that for the product Le uh cohort of your client base and then you have a framework or an exercise of how you think through how to make if you're changing the ICP it's typically uh earlier St you say hey this is the problem before the main problem we're solving that beginner problem how do you make sure that you how can you test the hypothesis that this earlier stage ICP is going to grow into the later stage is it just you got to run the experiments or do you have some you know Frameworks or exercises you walk your uh clients through to to stress test this before they go put a bunch of time and money into launching product Le and find that they can't actually out they just they've access a new version of the market they're not worth as much and they don't grow into the main thing I think a lot of times it's product like growth is the promise of you know ditch the sales team and allow users to use the product and graduate through their usage and evolution through the problem and the product into higher tiered plans um but there's a big hypothesis there that we pick the right beginner problem that leads to the intermediate problem you have any Frameworks or Ways to Think Through that yeah no absolutely there's like a couple that go in tandem so for the first one when you're thinking about who is that ideal user uh the framework I I love and I'm sure you guys are pretty familiar with it is a BJ fog behavior model where you're thinking about like how do you get anybody to do anything um just Google it if you're not sure what it is but on that one there's three kind of criteria you look at to get anybody to do any Target Behavior the first one is motivation so like how it are these users to actually sign up solve a specific problem and then when it comes to their overall ability like can they they get to Value here can they figure it out if they're not techsavvy and they can't go through it and you have a complicated product like I don't know that's gonna work um you can try but uh you might have to do some uh fine tuning on your overall experience so like I look at motivation ability the last thing is the overall kind of like triggers like are they constantly getting bombarded reminded of self this specific problem and if you're like yes super motivated yes they have a lot of good ability and yes they are like getting this message that they need to solve this problem this is like top of mind for them um those are like my favorite ideal users where we like okay now let's look at the retention stats see do these people stick around a long time uh if so it's like wow okay we found the the winner we're gonna double down on these people we're going to focus on them because they have a high likelihood of winning when it comes to uh using your specific product and so that's the very first thing is as you kind of evolve in your plg motion you will realize there's um kind of like you go from people who are like the chefs in the kitchen we like oh I'm okay like going into your sass product making my own food and like figuring it all out um those are usually like your early adopters then there's like the next level which is like the the microw wavers they're like I just want to go into your sass click a few buttons and get my you're like I love those people too and as you get better and better at what you do and make it easy you want to have more of those people who are like okay they're just microwav and eventually it's like completely automated kind of deal so that's kind of the the Spectrum and as every time you make one of those Quantum leavs going from like the chef to the microwave or all that stuff um your product should just become a lot easier for people to get that and you can basically 10x your tan every time you do that so so I had this question I wanted to ask you and you just dovetailed perfect the way you end did that sense about if you do X Y and Z you can 10x your total addressable market right and the question I have is a is a super high level one you talked a lot about you know not realizing that your ideal customer is going to change when you change a Scotto Market strategy a lot of the time the founders I work with are interested in trying a product Le motion because they haven't been able to get traction on a non product Le motion right like well maybe this will be the thing that unlocks it and I think frequently I don't know that that's a good plan right unless you're willing to make like the product changes and the org changes that you're talking about so my question was is when you're first starting to work with someone you're talking to a founder and they're like I want to do this product Le thing I'm assuming you ask them like why do you think this is a good idea for your company right like why should someone consider this you know and and answer it from whatever angle maybe they can't get traction at all maybe they got something good going on you know but it's not obvious that they might be in their ICP they might just think of this as another marketing tactic so like when is this a good idea in the context of a company yeah I I love this because um there's so many like rabbit holes could go down where when we think about a company that's not having traction like why why is it not having traction is it because you're not solving a meaningful problem like that's the thing where I'm like please don't just waste another like six months and a bunch of Runway to like make this plg thing work um to still not solve the problem you're not solving the problem if it's not it's like please don't um and I tell them like usually in our program like we we like want people to get at least to like six figurers plus where it's like okay you like I don't care if you sell that yourself founder that sales at that stage is amazing like please do that please understand your soling the meaningful problem like if we can check the box there it's like let's understand what is the best go to market motion to scale that and then we go into the equation of like does this make sense for you right now uh do you need to go into more of the Enterprise plates to to make this business work or is this more of like the uh kind of mass small medium-sized business problem where it's like this is the only way to do this like I know when I was talking to the founder of hotar like that was their whole thing they're like you know what all these Enterprise companies they're like charging a fortune for like this basic stuff and we just want to go into the S&amp;B space and like this is part of our mission and we know this is an existing thing a lot of people want this and so it can also come out that way where it's just like the founders is very Mission driven they want to like make this accessible to everybody I can get behind that too because they already know it's an established problem yeah you said something there very nonchalantly and I I want to just double click on it and and say it slower because I think there's a lot of people who probably listen to this that are at that stage where you think it's a a prudent idea for your first call it 7 to $10,000 in monthly recurring Revenue to talk to the customers run founder Le sales make sure that your product Market fit is at least has an early sign of being live and then at that point you make the decision that I'm going to scale my company by developing a product L growth strategy or a sales like grow like however you decide but that early stage first Revenue in up to you know 100K annually like still boots on the ground talking to customers hand toand is that is that your recommendation generally speaking ideally yeah like get that customer feedback all that stuff because you do actually lose a good chunk of that whenever you do go to self- sered because you're just like hey like see you um um you don't necessarily have to talk to us on that level and so you do not have the same level of like understanding of the problem and the offer all those things and so you can learn a lot faster if you do that yourself now what I've seen Founders do is like mix and match that over time they're like okay actually our onboarding process or sorry our sign up process can be completely automated it's like I don't want to do that part but then maybe you offer onboarding coaching sessions or something like that to get people to value a lot faster and so you can pH yourself out of it as you build your product in motion got it I just man I really thought we were gonna find I really thought we were gonna find someone in the camp of no it's okay you can hide behind the keyboard not talk to customers but turns out even the product leg guy says you got to go talk to clients like we it is a the number of times we say it in a given month we're like you have to go talk to your clients you have to go talk to your clients you you don't don't fight for you run the risk of automating a process that does not work if you don't talk to them enough like go run through onboarding watch how they use the product and when you see them do it the same way 10 times 50 times 100 times you're like perfect now we can lock that in maybe it's a tool tip maybe it's a video we figure out a way to like you know to to reduce the friction in product and we can go move on to other things but how do you I I would imagine if we're if we're we at sass Academy there's a I would say 30% of our products are product Le of the clients in our program are product Le first the other 70% are you know what we call midmarket or or Enterprise and we still talk about frequently hey goine do it manually first and then automate I'd imagine you are attracting all the people who want to like not talk to clients automate the whole thing like how do you does you know is there a happy medium like how do you deal with that objection when you're when you're talking to Founders trying to figure out what the product needs to look like yeah I guess like the way we restructure is like we just do it it's part of the process and um maybe that's not something you might know when you sign up because you're like oh I want the plg the dream and then you're like here's the broccoli and like really I gotta eat that and like yeah yeah yeah and uh so the way it's kind of like the it's all broken down here it's like you will mess up a lot of the other components and everything else if you don't do this and so it's like do you want the hard way or do you want the like simple way and the simple way is is actually a bit more work but it's work up front so that everything else is smooth sailing so um what do you want and usually a lot of people are like okay I get it and I think it's just also how do you make it easy for people to do because I think there's a lot of like people saying talk to customers but then there's not a lot of like hey here's an easy way to do it like there's tons of stuff you could do but um just just do this it'll get you there and try and make it something where it doesn't even f feel like you're like oh I'm setting up customer research calls it's like no okay the if you're doing demos that's that can count too if you're doing like onboarding coaching Sessions hey that can count too because you're just for us logging every single one of these little challenges where you're like oh yeah that's a bug how do we remove that so they don't have to talk to you on on that level and so um yeah I think it's just create that simple way they can do it yeah all right Wes uh if someone's listening to the call so far or the the podcast so far we've presented a lot of reasons to do product leg growth I noticed as I was doing some research for the podcast you do a pretty good job of putting the warning label on the bottle of you're not ready or not prepared to do it unless I call it counting the costs understand truly What It Takes I think the the iceberg image is a perfect illustration of this it's not just the you know the freemium or free Tri version probably get all the other stuff give us some reasons why like if you say what what's who's not right for product lead and and let's start to kind of unpack if you're not ready to do X Y or Z you should just leave product Le alone because it's destined to fail from the start oh man tell me when you want me to stop the rant rant on baby that's why you're here a lot so first thing is uh like what kind of Market are you on are you creating like a blue ocean where you're educating a lot of people on how to do things so if there is a lot of Education you got to do um that's kind of a red flag in one way where I'm like okay if it's hard for people to grasp understands um you may need to have more of that sales that way because you know what at the end of the day that salesperson is doing a ton of the heavy lifting of educating people providing value and it's not just friction it's a ton of value in that situation so um there's always like I know counter examples like Chach TBT launched completely new but it was easy enough for everybody to grasp if you can have it where it's like it's new and easy to grasp sure it could still work but it's new and hard to grasp like huh how do I do that uh red flag so that's the kind of first one the other kind of two are are really related are conviction and commitment I mean this just goes down to everything else I've had so many Founders where they're like yes I want this this is great they it's like somebody who wants to become a rock star and they're like I want to be him and then they look at like everything they got to do they're like oh no they practice that much they do that oh and then they get like dissuaded and then there's like yeah there's some changes here like actually when you go product Le the core thing I believe you should know just warning label is a sales Le business is easy to start hard to scale and a product Li business you know what it's really hard to start and it's easier to scale and so it's like where do you want to have that kind of like connection at the the beginning where it's hard or whatnot and so if you're not willing to have that hard start um that's that's a big red flag where I would be like okay probably another right that's a mic drop moment West right there man it's uh so do you find that you see more repeat Founders trying to do this out of the gate like people who are willing to eat the elephant early on in the process or like how do do you see anything there yeah like those are kind of best customers like Hey listen I I just have done the sales that thing I've exited these other companies but I don't know what I don't know on the product Le side I just want it's kind of a guiding hand to go through that so yeah absolutely man that's cool how I'm trying to think of how you can do the conversion how you can get both how you can get the easy to start and then somewhere along the middle of the journey recognize oh I'm getting to the part where it's harder to scale do you find Founders making the transition when they're trying to get out of founder Le sales and instead of hiring a sales team so like they're doing all the demos they scale it up like we we find the ceiling depends on the ACV but you're going to start feeling it at like a million million and a half in ARR if you're doing founder Le sales you start to like really drown in just the volume it's not we talked to a guy yesterday he's doing four million still still doing you know in the inner price space the numbers is sked a little bit but if we're talking averages you normally start to feel it when you get there do you have you seen a Founder doing founder Le sales make the pivot and get out of you know the easyest start sweet we got the easy part there and convert to the easier to scale or is the product side going to be challenging from day one regardless of whether or not you got the the base of Revenue like is it harder to do it in the middle of your journey or same I would always say it's harder to do it like later on in the journey than it is to do it at the very beginning and so that's just because if you like you're building the DNA is different in that company the processes are a lot different and yeah I've seen a lot of fumble because they're like hey we want to do this product lead thing and they do exactly what we did if they are like stop on the free Tri it's not working and then they're like they don't know everything below the service they got to change and then they learn that then they're like Max maybe we just double down on the sales thing a little easier we know it's predictable um and it's a proven Playbook like why not on that level now that can work but if it's like cord your strategy you figured out then that's another kind of thing you just have to to go through and blunder yeah yeah so despite that wisdom um let's say you are there right you're the 1 million AR founder you know you say that it's harder to do at that stage because the DNA but I'd love for you to pull that aart a little bit more like I'll give you an example what I'm thinking like one of the things that I feel like having a sales L process lets you punt very far down range is like product analytics right where you can get by with pretty lightweight couple data points maybe we'll figure it out when we go talk to the customers right so I feel like like that's one thing that probably if you're doing a plg motion you got to be surgical with but I'm sure for you as the expert here you probably know a half a dozen right like what are the non-obvious things where if you're that you know million and a half AR founder and you're like I want to flip the switch even though West knows it's hard and I'm know I'm going to be deficient in these certain areas like what are the things that they're going to have to go clean up you know what I mean from like the the non-obvious list of stuff so there's nine I don't know if you want me to go through them all but very do very first one is your shagy so how does this connect to how you're gonna win as a business uh first get cleared in like what is winning for your specific business um how can you become that obvious choice in your industry what does that obvious choice look like like there's only one canva in the space and we all know we love it all that stuff too but there's many many other kinds of companies but what could you actually win at so get clear on that what is required for you to do that how are you going to win that what are those modes you have to build in your business and so um what all Cascades from that is just you got to understand the capabilities that can we actually do that at a very high level become world class at that um so that's where you start and then it's like let's get super clear on our ideal user who is that person what are their challenges what is that like Super Mario kind of moment for them that transformation and then what is our our model is kind of the third thing it's just like how do we decide what do we need to give away for free for them to experience that that core kind of trans transformation and then the next phase is just literally how do we build your good to Market motion and product that could sell itself you need a good offer great onboarding and like powerful pricing which is like the pricing piece is really interesting because when I was reading my first book I was like uh it used this term where I was like it's kind of like this weird arranged marriage where you're like okay we have this model that we're giving away for free and then we have this pricing which like needs to feed into each other based on what we were talking about like some of the usage amounts of like if we give away this amount for free um then they magically upgrade to the the free PL so deciding like what does that look like is a really kind of big thing and you got to make it transparent and so um that's kind of the the sixth step and the last three really just how do you scale this up back to your point B about the data it's like what's going on with your users where are those users dropping off in that specific Journey do you know from sign up to First value to like hitting a q usage indicator in the product with the experi of Val three times or more to upgrading where are people dropping off so what is that biggest botle neck and then the next piece is like do we actually have a growth process to launch experiments to improve this again and again and the last one is team and it's last for a reason for a product company because if you go through that it's you can actually afford to hire as a last resort because your product will most likely solve the majority of the problems like if you have an onboarding problem it's not like let's just throw another body at it let's actually just see what could we do easier and so they don't need to reach out to us in the first place I feel like this's a slam dunk for like a strategically minded technical founder like this this has got to be the the playground for that person you know that's uh totally dude I love the framework thanks Wes it's cool so uh I saw you talk about this uh Rhythm you teach called the growth process meeting can you tell us about that yeah so this is kind of born from uh I'm sure you guys yeah I talked to Dan EOS you know EOS there's like your L10 meetings and those are fantastic meetings and so for the growth process meetings uh what that's really all about is how do we kind of get everybody aligned on first what is the core balock in the business so that's like the the first kind of part of the meeting we go through what is that but then what's really different about um the standard way of like iding uh specific issues in us and those specific meetings is we go through and say okay this is SC bottom neck let's just exhaust the number of solutions here H we're going to look at product Solutions content Solutions resource Solutions I call it the PCR test get everybody kind of brainstorming across the team as far as how do we solve this so everybody on the team is thinking about this cor botack how to be solved from all these different angles and then you're just simply killing a lot of these ones and saying actually that probably won't work that well um let's go through prioritize this list and then you come up with in out of that meeting like some very great things that everybody can do to just solve that specific bottleneck and you just happen to solve it a lot faster versus just kind of going through the standard way of like okay that first idea sounds amazing um on that end awesome I love it I'm very interested in the rhythms the problems will change right but the rhythms that solve the problems you get really good at that um I think a lot of people wonder like what is operations in a company and in my opinion it's that it's like building the the fitness of the organization to whatever problem comes your way you've got the the tools The rhythms of communication to solve that bottleneck so what you're saying is the bottleneck is always going to change a move this is the Rhythm that puts all the brightest Minds in the company on that problem on that bottleneck prioritizes Solutions and then gets into action yeah for sure and that keeps everybody accountable well like Whoever has that specific bottleneck they're they're kind of like the mini CEO for the week like everybody helped them like this is the core bottleneck for the business so let's uh drop not everything but like let's make sure we're helping this person succeed yeah I love it um Wes talk to us about writing the book you write you wrote one uh product L growth then book number two is coming out in August I'd really love to you get a tell us about how it's April now probably May by the time the scene comes out um is this a bet that you'll be done by August is it done and this is a part of the LA straty talk like I want to unpack why R WR book number two um and then two what's behind the launch strategy oh yeah so for the why part I don't know you kind of froze there just me Matt all good man why why do it and is it ready and yeah just rock and roll for sure yeah so for like why we decided to write this one is we realized a lot of companies were uh implementing FG and it just wasn't working and so we were like well why is that so we've helped over like 324 plus SAS companies we realized like you know a good chunk of them it was not sticking like they would go through the motion roll out the model all that stuff and so it's really everything we discussed today like everything below the surface how do we um help operationalize this and make it a product that organization that can actually support a worldclass plg motion and so um that's why I'm writing this book is really to make it easier for anybody to to go through this journey launch it and actually build and scale a successful product Leed business and so um that's yeah the the main mission behind this book and I guess how it connects to the business is it's literally our process for how we help it so as I'm writing it I'm like oh yeah that's the easiest best way we can help you so you learn about the book and that's also our free motion back to our beginner problem in order for you to understand you want to work with us you have to understand understands um what is the right path what is the best approach to do this and so that's the kind of transformation unlock for us where it's like hey first stage learn about that and a book is the best way to do that yeah it's interesting we're uh we're in the process of of doing the same thing uh sometime this year uh we will We launch uh SAS Academy's first book sharing the methodology and um it is uh it really is a a great way I love that you've said it's solving the beginner problem it's the methodology all of the execution is actually the the hardest part so I would think that most people hearing you talk through the nine elements I would say of where do we get where gets the majority of the time in Focus it's on the strategy piece and then I think most people think that like cool done so in the example here would be you read the book you think you got knowing is like five to 10% of the challenge it's the start but it's certainly not the uh you know the end um is that where you see most companies get shipped up as the main Bott on like the disconnect between you know having flushed out a strategy and then missing the other eight components that lead to a successful product Le uh growth model and organization or is there another another bottleneck that kills the pro uh the progress yeah actually it's funny you mention that because like I'm like no almost everybody that comes to us they think their strategies are rock solid and they don't even think about it and they don't like change it or anything like that with rolling up the field motion but they all get obsessed about the model and so that's usually where they most of them start in our process so they skip the first two things they don't know their ideal user no strategy they start there and then they slap on the new offer like oh why is it not connecting well it's like you're talking to a completely new ideal user but uh let's say it in a nicer way and then the onboarding experience isn't done or they don't do that very well and so people just don't get there and so the main thing they they have or left with is a low freet to pay conversion rate that's like the most common symptom that like you did something wrong across this process very interesting go ahead yeah that that passes a smell test with me I'm thinking back to my first company and I wanted Wes I wanted in the worst way to be product L I like I I saw it I saw I saw the the the Oasis right like they sign up and they get the thing and scalable and I mean I was a first-time founder I coming out of the fire department I had no idea how to build software I had no idea how to build an interface that worked well I I didn't know anything and luckily I realized that I had no idea how to do this stuff and like our software worked but everything you said I'm just I'm like going down this trip down memory lane everything you said was like oh yeah I couldn't have done that I couldn't have done that I couldn't done that or onboarding was like super manual you know um and so is this like what people get from the book and from your programs and stuff like that is it bridging that skill Gap because like if I had tried this five years ago I would have failed miserably and just you know probably failed the co company right so is it into the weeds where it's like this is how you build an onboarding flow this is how you guide people through that initial value process like what skill gaps do you see um that you help people get across yeah it's a great question because it's like back to um like you're a coaching organization as well it's like what do coaching organizations do really well it's like building capability and other people and so how you do that is like yeah you you do actually need to get sometimes in the weeds with people and help them understand not just like the needy gritty details but how to think holistically about this what are the Frameworks the mental models all those things and so um that's really our our mission too is like there's these nine core components but all of them are capabilities too how you understand your user how you understand like crafting your model not just for today but for the next version next time you go through your strategy and so yeah everything's built like that because it is a capability and that's our goal yeah I just I remember this being so naive man I was like I'll just buy appq like that'll solve the onboarding problem I'll just I'll put a couple popups I'll be I'll be good to go and you know another rant of mine yeah right so three years later we're doing one-on-one onboarding calls and that's the only way to get people to Value you know we just did it and we priced and it worked but yeah man I was like appq that that'll solve it sure didn't you see like oh how to get started like tool tip tool tip tool tip tool tip I call it like getting tool tipped to death and I'm like oh God I haven't got value yet what's the right version of that cuz I'm I'm putting myself in the in the seat of of clients that we coach and just Founders in general and myself five years ago and I'm like tool tips like yeah that'll do it just show them what to click and the users like is it a a bespoke onboarding process like you have to build this into the product and like lock stuff down until they go through the flow like I know it's a little bit individual but you know what are the overall best practices here like how do you nail this onboarding sequence yeah so I created this bowling framework to do just this like how to make it easier for people to to go through onboarding set it up and so if you know bowling you basically know how to do it which is like you know the goal is you want to get strikes and so the first part of the game is Define the game so what is the strike for your specific product and that fre your experience Define it then what we have to do from the very first point they get on to your homepage your website somehow maybe it's an ad or something like that and you map out currently all the steps to getting to that strike everything and what I like to do teams when we do this is like I want you all to like have a little competition with each other what is the exact minimum number of steps here because they're all going to find like different ways through the product and then we all kind of align and go through and say okay now how can we like kill 20 30% of these steps let's just label them red they don't need to be there stupid steps then there's the more complicated Nuance ones which are yellow which is like these are Advanced STS like useful but not right now like uh I was just working with the CL cents the other day and they're like yeah we want two Factor authentication like set up right when they Ono I'm like no terrible idea no you don't please don't I know you wanted but no uh so perfect example yellow step and then you're left with the green steps are literally just it's a straight line perfect straight line to that first strike now your product doesn't have that right now so what you need to do is you got to layer on the bumpers to make it easy for anybody to do this the first bumper is your product bumper so this is like back to the fqs of the tool kit tool tips you'd use are going to guide people from each step through that journey to exactly do that so it's anybody can sign up and get to Value and then the last bumper you throw on is the conversation bumper so where do people drop off and that's where we say okay people drop off from sign up to um onboarding okay so let's send them a message let's text them let's do something um to get them back on that straight line because we want to get them to the next step and then oh they drop off there okay we get them again uh with another like targeted communication a lot of times companies just do like the the stock like 14-day free trial onboarding sequence but um your messaging needs to be targeted based on where they're stuck so that's like high level how you could approach it dude I love that like that's that I feel like that's one of those nuances right is if it's very onetoone implemented you can get by with time based onboarding messaging but if it's not right it's got to be event based you know and yeah I love that man awesome thanks for breaking that down all right W I would imagine there's some sales Le companies that can learn a lot from just the the strategies that make product Le successful like I'm I've ripped a few pages out of the book of like seeing great product Le onboarding processes and say well even if we have a customer success Le motion there's still a lot of work that happens in between our training sessions that if I can reduce the friction you know it makes it more likely that they show up to my Psy training call with all of the stuff done um what have you I'm sure you've seen and maybe you have an example whether it was a vidyard or or others where can we take some of the principles from product Le and apply them to a sales Le motion and um see some efficiency's gained yeah like if you're gonna coach the sales Leed founder where do you focus yeah I would say let's start making your money right away and uh let's start with expansion and so how can we use like whether it's tool tips uh product or anything like that to start engaging people that are like right for upgrades based on their usage you go through that and just try and upgrade more people that's like the easiest way where it's like hey we're thinking product Le we already made you X number amount of dollars because of this that's awesome then you can start moving down to okay let's take another big swing let's look at your onboarding okay right now let's say for most sales like companies it's like on average kind of like two four calls uh with customer success to get you set up it's like okay how can we like kill one of those and and what are you do on that fourth call oh yeah yeah yeah totally let's map that out and let's just create tool tips or whatever that is to just do that automatically they're like oh great um now the customer is empowered they're saving money on is just way more efficient they can carry on like you know 25% more customers with the same staff so you get some efficiency it's not like the wow part but when you start really late basically reducing those from like four to like one um that's where you start getting the the insane uh leverage of a product like business but still at a sales that company from the onboarding and expansion side of De yeah I love I mean I think a great Gateway would be product Le expansion just focus on the expansion Revenue s because it's so much of our energy and effort uh when you do start deploying customer success teams is in onboarding and then we get them just past the burn line where we know they're not going to turn anymore and we just stop talking to them we just keep Focus the next ones to come in and we just leave so much opportunity in that relationship of you know increasing the LTV and uh developing a very low risk you can always intervene and in fact we've we've talked to uh clients that are predominantly whether it's fremium or just SMB where you can maybe do you know group onboarding calls but you're not working onet to one we help them triage their Client List to say okay just just talk to the top 10% and do manual expansion there like you know based on potential based on usage whatever Focus there but there's a whole quite often there's a whole cohort that you just don't the volume is so high you just don't have the time and it's not worth it one to one' be a great place to go hone some of those product Le skills um I'm curious Wes you are kneed deep in this space who's inspiring you what companies are pushing what's POS you know what's possible with product LED forward I mean with AI and um these you co-pilots and um low code no code Solutions like there's a lot of innovation happening in SAS right now there's some companies that are inspiring and and I guess pushing you to uh um I guess push the limits of what's possible with product Le yeah I mean there's so many like my oldtime favorite is definitely canva like that one's just like you know back to that Super Mario effect of like oh I can't design and then you're like I can somewhat [Laughter] design makes profile yeah exactly now my extented design is like it's good enough to communicate the idea then we have our Graphics designer takes it the whole another level I'm like okay good I can at least communicate my ideas um so that's definitely one of my favorites and they got like a powerful free new model for their business and then uh I mean up until recently I mean like chat gbt is a fantastic example of a killer free model uh that got me on the upgrade I was just curious and it was really good and and stuff like that too so I'm always always fascinated with the companies that um are usually in that like they bridge the gap between like B2B BTC kind of thing and they just have these really streamlined uh like next level scale U product Le motions and so I usually look at those companies for the ideas that is like hey what are they doing because their volume is nuts uh versus like taking it to the B2B SAS space where you're like hey you have like uh 100 people signing up how can we apply that to just making this really easy and it doesn't always translate but um I just like studying the examples where they have like millions of signups per month to kind of see what have they done what are they doing a bit differently to to optimize that on morning because you can bet they got many teams just focusing on one of those flows um to improve for people can we talk can we talk benchmarks for a minute again Matt and I are spend most of our time with with a midmarket and Enterprise s help me understand what's normal like acvs for a product Le SAS company what's the normal you know turn rates ltvs like help when you I'm sure you kind of run through an assessment when you're working with a client and figureing out what to go do next like what what's what what are some of the red you know the alarms that go off when you are working with really high turn um or exceptional retention like help us walk through some of the benchmarks of what's normal yeah so like one red flag if they're like ACV is like 30 to like 50k or something like that they're like if we want to keep it with this product lead motion and I'm like this is going to be really hard because you're still gonna have to hop on a call with them uh and it's not gonna be like pure in that sense I'm not like a purist but I'm like it w't be self-served if you will like you could get them to Value you could get them to sign up self- served but the full thing you will not get zero touch customers um with that kind of price point so on average like what we're looking at is like sub 10K uh ACV is is usually very common for product like companies but that does not mean it could grow until something a lot bigger and I think the one super underrated thing with product like companies is um they are if you get your pricing right they are built to expand and start small and then if you have your value based metric set up correctly it expands on autopilot in that sense is they get more value you start charging the more and you have that great relationship and so um yeah it can grow up to those 30 40 50 even 100K plus per month options how about turn rate yeah like what's thiser yeah you might you might love the uh not having a team until you start to see like what is average turn like help me understand what's the range good better best of of turn in a product like company yeah so like anywhere from like three to kind of like 6% um that's kind of like on average what we usually see for some of our clients and stuff and so that can vary a lot though like if you're really dialed in on who your ideal user is and you've done the retention kind of analysis and you know who is the good one versus the bad one signing up for your product um you can reduce that but yeah you are still usually dealing a lot more with smaller medium-sized businesses that do even just business Cycles go to business or they are more price sensitive so um yeah that is probably the one other thing of back to the red flags if you're worried about that um as far as going into product La that is a valid concern for sure what what are the top acquisition channels you're seeing like because it you have your cost of acquisition has to be in line with the lower ACV as well so it's not just you can't take your I think this has got to be one of the most challenging pieces for these uh you know midmarket 30 50k is like the channels that you're using to acquire those customers have got to change in some way I guess in so I guess Thinking Out Loud here in some ways you could also say that there's you're attracting traffic from those channels it's not qualified to buy your 30 to 50K offer and so you're you're you have product that is almost like the down Market solution to keep them in your world until they are ready but what channels do you see and and then if you have benchmarks on like acquisition costs and and CA payback periods I'd be interested on that yeah me too uh for the CAC set of things too on that end but I will tell you like for where product like companies Thrive most is like red Oceans Where It's commoditized is like you you want to have that like product that go to Mar commotion to succeed and so when it comes to what channels work in that it's like hey if you can establish an early advantage in organic SEO like that's fantastic because that is a very lowcost Channel as you scale it up OB not low cost when you're doing it really really well um and then just like paid search is great one if you do have people searching for intents if you don't have intents I mean social is great for that where it's like okay you have never thought about using this kind of products but you should but that's usually in a red ocean people know to some degree what they're searching for and so yeah those lower cost options before are the best ones cool it's interesting so so many entrepreneurs coaches advisers would say run from the red oceans you're saying like this is a good sign on lead you want there to be so much you want you almost want to just be playing a demand capture game rather than demand creation right which is I think to your point earlier don't do product Le if there's a huge educational component to your product that would be demand creation we're educating on a new problem in a new point of view a lot of dollars spend doing that and therefore higher um you know ACV required you're saying hey we want people every we want everyone feeling like they've got a design problem and there's hundreds of design Solutions out there we're just going to beat them with a great product experience AKA canva and um and weigh in a red ocean I love it um yeah I mean one thing to to kind of prove that that doesn't necessarily mean you don't or can't create like a a killer strategy or something like that within that red ocean but like one of our clients lit uh they they just have like they're going against Apollo and it's like you know what for that specific example it's like they have one thing against them it's like triple verified emails and all that stuff it's amazing and so that is a perfect example it's like you can still frrench it can go through that but then you still have that go to market motion that makes it more efficient yeah dude I couldn't agree more like I I talk about this a lot in fact even in a article I wrote this morning I put this Twitter threat up about how to compete against the 800 pound gorillas in any industry and like just I don't know I I get the Blue Ocean strategy I like it but there is such a beautiful angle especially for bootstrap Founders whether it's product Le sales Le about competing against a big slow comfortable incumbent slicing a piece of the market by specializing more and using that as the way to get the strategy started it's just I don't know man it's like I feel like that's the cauldron that most startups were were brewed inside of you know it's uh so I don't know yeah I'm with you a lot of people shun the red ocean I'm all for it man totally yeah you know there's actually demand exactly yeah W one of the things I'm taking away for the sales Le Crew out there is in a single session when they're out there searching for a solution we've got to get them as far into solving that problem as possible and if you they just so happened to land on your website and request a demo and it stops there and they the process really slows down we're leaving a lot on the table so we got to figure out a way to get them farther in the process years ago I developed this tactic called the demo on demand that say Hey if you don't want to wait for my sales team at least let you see it and then later on when that was successful we actually opened up a a premium element to it because we started to recognize that the more they were they were only going to buy when they were pain was at its highest point and that could Wayne you know there would you the next day they could wake up and the pain wasn't there so if we got them as far into solving the problem feeling what this problem forever solved felt like we earned a customer for life but it was really quick and easy to move on to another problem in the business and so um I love this you know just stealing a couple uh couple of the product Le whether you whether it's you start product Le or convert to it or just take some of the principles I think it's been a really useful conversation on um just like the the psychology of what it's like to implement a new software product into someone's workflow um Matt you got anything else no no I'm uh I'm good I'll I tell you the biggest takeaway I've had though right is because all of my experience is sales Le organizations and um I feel like with maybe one or two small exceptions that everything we've talked about on this conversation to become a world-class product L organization can also if implemented well into your sales L company help you become a better version of the sales L company you already were right I think like the streamlined onboarding the lessons hit the um deeper product analytics the figuring out out the value switch and the expansion Revenue rhythms and the whole nine yards I just I think there's so much to learn from what you're teaching Wes even if you're not a product L company even if you have no aspiration to be a product L company I think there's things in here that will just make you a better company period full stop and I think that's a beautiful takeaway for the people listening to this episode is like don't set this down if you're not product LED because there's a lot to learn here um regardless of your motion so that's my big takeway man yeah and I think to wrap that up too like something about where the Market's headed where B2B buyers are going as like three of every four B2B buyers would prefer to try before they buy before they do this this like where people are headed and if you want to compete long term it's pretty hard to go against uh like neck and neck against a product that company versus sales I one because the product I want is just has so much more efficiency you think of like they can do a lot more with a fraction of the people um they can scale way easier they can lower their costs versus you they can have a better product than you and all those different things and so um my my kind of like final say is like just don't wait don't wait too long because somebody might if you have a good Market just do the product Le version of that and take your lnch yeah I think to really reach your full potential as a SAS company you're gonna have to be able to wield both tools you need to have a sales team that have a great well-timed conversation and have the handheld uh model down pat and you get your product's got to be fantastic there's no way to really stress test a product and not using human intervention to get the the result and you can do both those things and now we have the skill set the team uh the operation to solve with whatever solution uh is best for that problem like we're in a really good spot um Wes this has been a lot of fun I feel like we uh I'm looking forward to you're actually speaking in our our next SAS Academy intensive in June really excited to spend some more time get you in front of our
