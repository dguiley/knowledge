the Americans are losing influence dramatically Indonesia is the largest Muslim population in the world of any country and the Indonesians were strongly pro- us and anti-china 10 years ago uh that has now flipped and it's flipped almost completely because of Gaza which is considered to be a domestic issue by the Indonesian population and the government Ian where does this podcast find you I am at home right now in New York I'm going to go to my office right after this let's bust right into it you recently delivered your anticipated 2024 state of the world speech in Tokyo where you outline the major themes and forces shaping the geopolitical landscape including the wars in the Middle East and Russia the impact of China's managed decline I love that term the impending us election and and AI you said we should be most worried about the absence of Global Leadership what do you think is driving this leadership vacuum and who is if anyone poised to step in I don't think anyone's poised uh to step in right now um I mean you know you look at what's happened in the Middle East over the last year uh and the United States is by far the most powerful Ally of Israel uh but has been basically hands off and the Israelis have been making the decisions as they choose fit um the uh the Chinese so are the most important Ally out there most powerful of Russia on the global stage they've had no impact uh on uh what the Russians have been doing in Ukraine over the course of the last few years and no one else is close to the Americans or or secondarily uh the Chinese so I mean it's it's not as if I mean there's all sorts of leadership but not Global Leadership it's National leadership it's leadership at home it's focusing more on the stuff that you have going on in your own country especially when people when most people around the world are are not comfortable or not happy with the direction that their countries are heading and we're seeing that play out in elections all over the world what is the downside of that if do you feel I mean I'll give you an example it feels like I can't figure out if Israel is ignoring the us or the US is actually quietly coordinating and trying to trying to pretend that they're going against their wishes you claim or you state and it feels obvious now that Russia is sort of ignoring China is that a good thing where we have a more diverse ecosystem or do we need one or two superpowers kind of moving the the pieces around on the chessboard uh it's a more uncertain thing uh I mean certainly if you're Russia you like it more if you're Israel you like it more if you're North Korea you like it more if you're Iran you like it more I mean generally speaking you know countries that want to be able to act unconstrained from the international Norms multilateral architecture Ure you know sort of collective security alliances countries that don't like to be you know sort of contained by that um are happier when you have an absence of Global Leadership I mean I can tell you quite strongly Scott that uh the Israelis have been ignoring what the United States would prefer but the US has been unwilling to do very much to try to get that outcome to be fair which is VE very similar um to what's been happening with the Russians uh vises China and I'm not trying to suggest um that these are these wars are the same but I think it's just interesting that if you talk to the Chinese they'll say oh but we we support Ukrainian territorial integrity and sovereignty and and I I can say in response well sure well the United States supports a two-state solution well we have pretty good relations with the ukrainians well well the Americans are doing what they can to get pal you know a humanitarian Aid to the Palestinians but but is that actually happening and the answer is no how how much effort are these countries willing um to deploy how much political Capital to try to ensure that the outcomes they say they want they're actually getting and the answer is very little the answer is very little and I don't I don't see that changing in either place uh anytime soon so whenever we have you on we kind of do this round the world around Robin so to speak so let's let's start and we'll end up uh with the US election but first give us your state of play or your view on the state of the war in the Middle East right now so um you and I are talking Scott on Monday I know this is coming out on Thursday uh oil pric is down 6% today and wh why would that happen because this round of escalation is over you know Israelis um hit Iran back after waiting almost a month s of right sort of yeah yeah yeah no they hit him back they did more d damage to Iran on the ground than the Iranians did to Israel I mean so you could say I mean I don't know if you said sort of when Iran hit Israel I find the whole thing the word I would use I'm curious if you agree with this the word I would use on both parties Iran and Israel is performative yeah I think that's right I think that's absolutely right um I don't think that what set this all off which was the assassination of hamas's political leader um during the inauguration of Iran's president in tran that was not performative um Israeli strikes killing Hassan NASA who runs Hezbollah and blowing up hezbollah's leadership that's not performative but the last two rounds absolutely performative the Iranians waited for um you know weeks and weeks and when they finally did engage in strikes they gave the Americans a heads up in advance and and that ensured um that there was going to be minimal damage on the ground in Israel and the only person that was killed you may remember was a Palestinian living in the West Bank right and the Israeli response was also restrained and here um I I don't I haven't given the Americans much credit in restraining um Israel but here I think they deserve a little uh because the United States really wanted to ensure that Israel did not hit Iranian nuclear facilities or energy facilities and they didn't and in part that's because the United States offered some incentives to Israel over the last few weeks they uh fast-tracked the Thad missile defense stood it up in less than two weeks on the ground in Israel a new system uh they they already had uh one from the us at the beginning of the war they gave them another um and then um they also uh started sanctioning some of the ships that had turned off their transponders uh shipping oil tankers out of Iran illegally exporting it breaking us sanctions the US probably should have done that a year ago but did that um to basically show the Israelis hey you know we're going to ensure these guys have less money to spend on the proxies that are attacking you and I think that both of those things plus a little diplomacy um helped restrain Israel's response more than they would have done um absent that so give me the other side of the AR well I'll put forward an argument you give me the other side of the argument for de deescalation here and that is whether it's the houis Hamas or hesah the credit card funding all of this chaos and Terror if you will is oil coming oil revenues coming out of Iran wouldn't the sort of cut the head off the snake strategy of going in and basically saying we're going to start shutting off this credit card unless you stop funding these proxies and they did not do that give me give me the political calcul for why they did not do that I think it's a really good question Scott I mean they're exporting right now over a million barrels a day um and the the typical argument you'd give and this is the argument the Americans have quietly given over the last almost three years for why Russian export of oil has not been cut off right I mean America's friend the Indians are buying an obscene amount of Russian oil some of which they're refining and then sending on Europe and the reason that wasn't cut off is because the US is concerned that that would spike oil prices and lead to a global recession um that's just not true with the million barrels that the Iranians are exporting OPEC has over a million barrels right now that they are holding back uh I mean what's driving prices which are pretty low is the fact that there isn't a lot of demand and particularly the Chinese economy is performing so poorly Chinese consumption so given all of that there's not a really good argument for why you want doing more to cut off Iran which is why I said I'm a little surprised that the Biden decision to hit these ships with the transponders they didn't do that why didn't they do that six months ago nine months ago like why are you letting the Iranians export illegally now some of that getting getting all of that million plus off the market would have also involved probably sanctioning some Chinese institutions that the Americans have been loathed to do because China is a lot more powerful and has the capacity to hit you back so I mean there's definitely some narrow economic self-interest playing out here but I I am in the camp that more can and should have been done um to cut off Iranian export absolutely Russia Ukraine where we going where we are well state of play how things have changed it's I would argue the biggest winner or one of the biggest winners of the Middle East conflict has been Putin because it's taken the Western gays off of Ukraine and where are we people haven't been focused on it what's the what's the state of play on the ground what do you think if what do you think 2025 holds for Russia Ukraine well Scott by people you mean Americans because Europeans are are relentlessly focused they're spending more overall and they have been than the United States something the Americans probably don't appreciate um and they recognize that if Trump comes in and cuts off the ukrainians they are going to have to do more and I think they will um is it enough for the ukrainians that's another question but this is and will remain a much more existential issue for most of the Europeans who who see not only that in many cases they've got a border with Ukraine or a border with Russia but also they're engaging in all sorts of asymmetric fighting with Russia directly you know I mean if you if you go on telegram I mean the Russian Gru I mean their spies are are paying lots of money for locals Russian speakers ethnic Russians in many countries across Eastern Europe to engage in Acts of Espionage vandalism arson other criminality you name it this is a war that is being fought um on the ground in Europe um it's it's well beyond dis information so they are they are focused like a laser on what happens going forward and that conversation the conversation across Europe has not slipped to the Middle East it is focused on Russia Ukraine where in the United States Russia Ukraine is a decided you know number two if even that um so there's a real Gap you know I I'll tell you one thing that I think the media has gotten wrong recently and and because it's attracted a lot of headlines I think it's worth you and I going into for a couple minutes is the the North Korea angle uh people are talking about North Korea and saying it shows desperation that Russia's going to get 10,000 troops from North Korea and it means they really can't fight they can't go anywhere else they're scraping the bottom of the barrel uh in the broad scheme of things 10,000 poorly trained troops from North Korea being sent as Canon fod to the front lines who don't speak the Russian language won't be effectively trained or into ated matters almost none to the fighting that is not what's going on here what what the North Koreans have done that really matters is a solid majority of all the artillery that is being used against Ukraine um and the ammunition being used against Ukraine that is North Korea um and that that that means the the war North Korea is absolutely the war machine behind what's happening on the front lines right now and that's been going on for months and months now what's interesting about the North Korean decision to send troops is it really solidifies a military Alliance that Russia has now signed with North Korea it's made them closer to North Korea than the Chinese are the Chinese are not aware of what the details of that military agreement comprise and they're deeply discomforted by that and historically of course the Chinese are the ones that called the shots for Pyongyang if any one did so that that's what's really different here um and and the fact that they are you know a a nuclear weapon state that is developing aggressively much more advanced technology including like nuclear submarines that the Russians are clearly helping them with Advanced ballistics you know maybe even some space stuff um that is uh that's a serious problem uh and and that's something that the Russians are 100% behind in the last few months what has happened on the ground the Russians been making progress is it a stalemate or the Ukrainian Army pushing back back what's the state of play on the ground so the big thing that happened the spectacular thing that happened a couple months ago is the ukrainians decided to take almost 40,000 well-trained troops and send them into Russia czy territory of K uh which they have taken and they have held much of it um they are they're now losing territory uh to the Russians but the Russians have largely ignored that they've referred to it as terrorism uh internally um and they have instead uh sent more troops to inside Ukraine and they are taking which is now less well-defended and they are taking more of the donbas um so I I would argue um and most NATO leaders would argue that this was zalinski both with the flare for the spectacular to show that the you know ukrainians can still do very unexpected things and cause pain for Putin and also getting desperate because they're increasingly recognizing that they aren't going to have the capacity to keep fighting the way they have for the last 2 and a half years this is a dangerous move for them this this makes it a lot harder um for them to hold their own front lines with the Russians having already taken about 22% of the country and threatening to take a lot more so if you ask me over the next 3 six months you know I I think that there's a much higher likelihood that the Russians take all of the donbas and that is uh you know going to lead to more displacement um and also reduce Morale on the part of the ukrainians Russia's also in the last couple of months done unprecedented damage to Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure um as winter approaches and that's going to make it a much harder winter for the average Ukrainian only about 40 million people live in Ukraine right now um there was over 50 million um before the war um and those numbers I suspect are going to continue to go down over the next several months you refer uh China's quote unquote manage decline that's your term and I I like it what do you mean by that well I'm talking uh in part um about the uh relationship between China and the United States that I mean we are heading towards confrontation but both countries are trying to avoid sudden crisis and ensure through a lot of highlevel communication um that the relationship doesn't deteriorate any faster than it needs to and any more broadly than it needs to the Americans are doing that I think in part because we've got our hands full with a couple of different Wars um and an election cycle the Chinese are doing that because their economy is performing worse than I've ever seen it certainly since the early 90s maybe since the 70s I was just in Beijing a couple of weeks ago I spent the week there and um every provincial government is bankrupt and and real estate is in crisis that is 70% of Chinese consumer wealth and about 30% of Chinese government revenue and and they're not going to come close to their 5% growth Target this year this is a new Chinese economic leadership put in place by shishan ping um they are suddenly telling the president uh we're not going to be able to perform like we told you we were not a good place to be on your first year and that's also the 75th anniversary of the Chinese Communist party so there was a lot of panic going on among the top economists uh a couple weeks ago in China and that's why they're all trying to run around and say what do we do what kind of stimulus do we put in place it was it was the it's the same kind of transition that we saw when they went from zero covid to suddenly overnight you we're just going to rip up the QR codes and everyone can do what they want remember Scott you know for a year a solid year this was Chinese officials crowing internationally about how they cared about their people and the Americans didn't the Europeans didn't the Japanese didn't we didn't take care of our citizens we let them get sick and die and the Chinese were the one country that really cared and they literally ripped that up overnight overnight it was as if they had nothing to do with zero covid so the Chinese leadership got it wrong they didn't get good information and now for the second time in only a few years we're seeing the same thing that the Chinese leadership thought they had like a decent control on their economy thought it was just incremental challenges that they'd be able to effectively respond to this year nothing major required and then suddenly almost overnight realizing that isn't the case at all it really is striking it's like you know you don't you don't humans are adaptable and it's been so incremental but the change as I think about it in preco call it late teens I was in China two three times a year doing business advising American companies on their efforts in China advising some Chinese companies on their efforts in America and I have not been to China in four or five years and have no plans to go back and I realize that's pulse marketing but as I think about I mean the freeze is pretty deep here would you agree with that yes and you see it across the corporate Community now uh if you are a big Western multinational with exposure in China you don't want to make announcements that you are making layoff off you don't want to make announcements you're taking money out because you know that will that will get you punished by the Chinese but quietly uh everyone is trying to reduce exposure the only part of the Chinese economy right now that is actually performing and keeping their numbers up is the manufacturing sector and it's manufacturing without consumer demand so there's massive over production right now um and that's leading that's not politically sustainable in other parts of the world it's causing backlash you know complaints of dumping all of this sort of thing and it's making the relationship with between China and other countries uh more uh more confrontational so they're really in a corner here they're going to need structural reform they they it's a it's essentially a major financial crisis and and and in fact the one thing that I was quite surprised by when I was in China was just how much violent crime there is right now a lot of people talking about you know uh stabbing and people driving their car into crowds and high-profile suicides and some that got public notoriety and then immediately taken down off of WeChat uh and some just people talking about things happening in their own neighborhoods happening on their own street corners that sort of thing now I mean if this was happening in any normal country around the world and by normal I mean a country that you get reporting out of information out of it's all we'd be talking about but because it's China and because very few people go to China right now I mean that there just there's nowhere near the level of travel um that you saw preo and and because the Chinese don't actually report on any of this stuff we're not really talking about it um and that's a I think that's a really big deal so as a means of beginning to talk about the US election what i' like to do in is I'd like to go through all three of these the war in the Middle East the war in uh Ukraine and the impact of China's managed Decline and do you for us some scenario planning how how do each of those play out differently in a Harris or a trump Administration let's start with the war in the Middle East okay um so Biden has been one of the most strongly pro-israel candidates we've ever seen uh presidents um and and uh it is it is unclear uh that Harris would significantly alter that she's made you know a repeated statements that the the alliance between the US and Israel is sacran and us will do everything to defend Israel she clearly is much more concerned um about um the Palestinians about um their ability to self-govern about getting them humanitarian Aid I think some of that is because of the changing demographics of the United States on Israel Palestine young people in particular being much less motivated by a pro-israel policy much more sympathetic to the Palestinians and some of it is that as a lawyer um she's just generally more interested in rule of law and international norms and feels like the Americans are supporting a policy that undermines that and that undermines US influence around the world so I I you suspect that under Harris US policy on Israel Palestine would be more aligned with the Europeans um than it is right now where with Trump uh I mean actually if anything he is a little more hawkish than even Biden uh he would he certainly has is I mean he's indifferent um to what happens to the Palestinians he says he no longer supports a two-state solution though he did did uh when he put together the Abraham Accords um and he was the guy that of course recognized the Golan Heights as Israeli territory he moved the embassy to Jerusalem he has no problem with further illegal settlements of Israel on the ground in the West Bank I suspect that he would be fine um with a more assertive and expansionist Israeli military strategy in the region including against Iran's nuclear capabilities which he might be inclined to help Israel with so there's a little bit of a difference there but it's not it's not dramatic in my view uh Russia Ukraine Russia Ukraine is much more different now both uh Harris and Trump would want the war to end uh but their their modalities would be very different Trump is much more of a unilateralist he's not interested in coordinating with the Europeans at all he would call zalinski and call Putin and basically say you're going to end this war you're going to accept a ceasefire territorial delineation where it is right now or else what's the or else with the ukrainians or else we cut off support with the Russians or else we sanction you a lot tougher um and uh would he follow through on that would the ukrainians and the Russians listen to him interesting question certainly a better deal for the Russian s uh than they're getting presently or then they'd get under Harris but that doesn't mean that Putin would find it acceptable there's a big difference between you know Trump's rhetoric uh with Russia in his uh 2017 presidency and actual policy towards Russia which was harder line the javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine tougher sanctions than it was under Obama so I think that there's what what was clear is if Trump became president again the Europeans uh would feel very much Cut Loose from this process and that would be that'd be a crisis for Europe if Harris comes in she would want to coordinate um a policy towards Ukraine that would lead to a ceasefire but she would coordinate that with NATO and then take that joint policy with the ukrainians if she could make it happen and try to get everyone to force Russia to the table would that work or would that just be a continued drip drip drip as the Russians continue to fight very interesting question hard to know um but I mean certainly Biden's policy Russia Ukraine has been great in keeping the alliance together hasn't been so great for the ukrainians long term uh and then if you want to go to China Jake Sullivan the National Security adviser went to Beijing a few weeks ago spent 14 hours with Wang Yi the foreign minister um then he spent an hour and a half with Shin Pang and the purpose of that trip um was to ensure a stable transition in policy if Harris becomes the president I spent an hour and a half with wangi when I was there a couple of weeks ago he told me he was very appreciative of the effort that Jake and the Biden Administration have put into the relationship the time the communications and the rest so I think that if Kamala were to become president I think that us China policy would remain very consistent with where it is right now Trump of course um sees China policy and sees much foreign policy through a more economic and transactional lens through the lens of tariffs he has talked about a 60% across the board tariff on Chinese exports um six months ago 12 months ago China wasn't sure if they would prefer Harris or Trump trump might be someone they could do a deal with Trump also will antagon a bunch of allies creates more flexibility for the Chinese potentially this trip everyone in China says we want Harris why because the state of their economy means they can't handle the uncertainty so one other thesis I find that Americans because of our prosperity and our blessings and the fact that we really haven't been attacked I mean you could say 911 was an attack but you know domestically the Homeland has been pretty pretty kind of attack or threat free that as a result we always believe believe that all peace is a good peace and I would put forward that there is a bad peace and there are good Wars and what's happening in the Middle East over the mid and long term might be seen in retrospect as having been a good War where we end up with stronger alliances in the Middle East and the equivalent of a much stronger Iron Dome and what might end up being a sustained peace your thoughts well first more broadly I agree with the thesis that there are good Wars there aren't many of them but there certainly are World War II was a good War the Americans took way too long to enter it and to fight it and we almost lost as a consequence but it was a good War uh we needed to win that war we needed to enter that war um the first Iraq War uh and defending Kuwait was a good war in my view um and one that we needed to enter and I think the Ukraine war which we are partially responsible for because um we told the ukrainians we were going to bring them into NATO and then we didn't um and uh and when the Russians invaded in 2014 a little bit we did nothing um and basically a blinking yellow light we're finally late uh defending Ukraine I think that's a good War Israel Palestine Lebanon is more complicated for me uh for a couple reasons uh first the United States is losing a lot of influence around the world as a consequence of supporting Israel in a full-throated way and an undiff differentiated way um which is virtually isolated compared to other countries um you see I mean at the security Council the American make Americans making vetos that even the the allies of the US won't stand up for the French the Brits for example um the fact that in countries across say southeast Asia the Americans are losing influence dramatically Indonesia is the largest Muslim population in the world of any country and the Indonesians were strongly Pro us and anti-china 10 years ago that has now flipped and it's flipped almost completely because of Gaza which is considered to be a domestic issue by the Indonesian population and the government uh Malaysia also flipped uh brune who cares but still same thing Singapore a little bit so there are places that the US is definitely losing influence because of that now having said that Scott um I agree with you um that there are um the the Israelis and the Gulf States are aligned here and they're becoming more aligned irrespective of the Saudis saying that they need a Palestinian state to do a deal uh to break uh to get to finally uh open relations with Israel generally speaking Israel is in a strong position vises the Gulf States and also in terms of its own defense and Military capabilities now what we don't know and even leaving aside any humanitarian concern for um the two plus million Palestinians living in Gaza leaving leaving aside any humanitarian concern for the over 1 million Lebanese that have been displaced over the last month the question is will they have any capacity to take action against Israel or against the US and its allies in the region or more broadly are we going going to see more radicalism for a generation which the US intelligence agencies believe we will on the back of the way that this war has been fought by Israel um and yes a lot of Hamas operatives and leaders have been killed lebanes operatives and leaders have been killed uh but the humanitarian damage that has been attendant to that as a consequence of the war is utterly staggering and I assume a price will be paid for that at some point um but and and that's again that's leaving aside just the humanitarian point which As Americans I think we shouldn't leave aside we certainly our the history of our country is not that we leave it aside but implicit in that statement is a very rational argument that I would reduce to you know are you are you creating more terrorists than your killing right with this incredible humanitarian disaster um I would argue on both sides but obviously in terms of Civilian population the Palestinians have have have paid a huge price uh you know I I I do think it's important to note that the Israelis have prosecuted this war with a lower a civilian to enemy combat mortality rate than any War we've prosecuted and what I come to or the argument I would put forth is it's about incentives and we at the end of World War II continued to bomb hurg and Dresden despite the fact we had won the war at much greater civilian to combaten mortality ratios and when asked why uh Eisenhower and the generals responded they need to know they lost is there an argument that as horrific as this is this damage that you're creating an incentive system where it essentially gets people quite frankly to think twice before continuing to constantly arm rearm and have a zeist and an entire Constitution that is just you basically attack Israel and attempt to affect what is I see as a genocide I see one side Israel is accused of genocide I think they could they don't I think the proxies would but can't is there something to the notion that quite frankly counter punching much harder creates a safer region with incentives that finally line up not to to to stop attacking Israel um it is an unanswerable question Scott but I mean of course it is hard to argue that the Palestinians don't know that they're losing um they've been losing territory for a long time now right I mean again in the West Bank uh while the war has been prosecuted in Gaza they're losing a lot more territory illegally to the Israeli settlers with the support of the Israeli government um I I don't think that helps Israel's cause personally um and oh they've gone from the good guys to the bad guys in terms of global perception they've managed their brand terribly I I would I would arue like when I when you and I were kids you they were the good guys they were the David now they're the Goliath well of course because and to be fair some of that even if they had handled this war as well as possible which they have not but even if they had and even if they had showed so much more restraint and gone in with a multinational Force after October 7th and you know macron said I'm willing to fight with you okay well let's do this together and let's be targeted even if they done that you know how much anti-Semitism there was running up to October 7th a lot of people would have said they were the bad guys and would have said that because they're more powerful because their military is more capable because they're a lot richer because the Palestinians are living in a horrible environment um and you the Palestinians own some of the blame for that and so do the Gulf States for not doing anything about it so does the Americans so do the Israelis there's plenty of blame but you're not asking me who's responsible you're asking me what's the smart strategy I have a hard time believing that after the you know the the massive depredation the you know sort of 90% of Gaza Palestinians without enough water before the October 7th 50% without enough food before October 7th and and then following that on with one tenth as much humanitarian support getting in for the last year I don't think that that is going to lead to better behaved more quiescent Palestinians willing to work with Israel over the long term I don't believe that uh Maybe I'm Wrong uh I mean I look my my mom was Armenian uh before she passed um and you know the Armenians um for Generations harbored irrational hatred towards Turks Turks that had done nothing to the Armenians but historically they had um more recently we've just seen about 120,000 Armenians ethnically cleansed from mountainous harak which um oddly uh former president Trump just tweeted about a couple days ago but otherwise nobody talks about it um because we're living at a time of Greater impunity where if you have the military might to ensure that you're in charge you get to win um and that's what happened the Americans complained the French complained but Baku is about to host their cop Summit for Global Climate as a p State um and they're occupying that territory and the Armenians aren't going to get it back and that's just the way it is so I I think that we're heading towards a different Global Order going back to the beginning one without Global Leadership one that feels more anarchic one where the relatively loose um rules and Norms that we have that we largely the Americans have created with allies to try to reduce instability around the world is breaking apart so that's why I was just in you know Asia that's why our allies the South Koreans and the Japanese are talking more about getting nuclear weapons I don't think that's a good thing why because they're concerned that the Americans might not be willing to defend them and countries might be willing to use nukes uh in a more likely in this environment than they would have 10 or 20 or 30 years ago because those Norms are eroding I think there's lots of stuff like that happening that makes our world more dangerous yeah I would I would agree that uh the world's policemen did in fact have some upside so I'm curious if you well I'm going to ask you I want to return to the domestic uh to return to the Homeland in our remaining minutes here curious a if you have any predictions about the election and also I mean most of the smart people I know have said it's a tossup they kind of shrug their shoulders they might have a thesis but then they shrug their should shoulders and say it's it's within the margin of error what do you think about how such contrasting candidates and the fact that it's a tossup what do you think it says about America and just curious if you have any thoughts or predictions about this election and what might happen after I think I mean we're we're saving this for the end so it's an abbreviated conversation it deserves more but you know uh as someone who looks at the world more than I look inside the United States the common thesis this year is throw the bums out we're not happy with where our country is going we want somebody different we just saw that in Japan this weekend stable Japan we've seen it you know even in India where Modi is so incredibly popular but has to govern in Coalition South Africa UK Austria Germany France I mean you name it around the world this is what we're seeing so this election in the United States with inflation having been high and now it's coming down but the prices haven't gone down and illegal immigration having been really high and now it's coming down but the illegal immigrants are all still here um you know whoever is holding the bag is probably going to lose so I mean you know ex anti your view of this election should be it's a change election and the Republicans should win having said that Trump is the least attractive least fit candidate the Republicans could possibly run I mean any other Republican candidate would win easily in my view um certainly against Biden and and against kamla Harris as well but but Trump is not any other candidate he is a uniquely unfit candidate um and therefore it's a tossup that's that's so that's my thesis um and if you ask me like you know if I had a bet what would I bet I I guess I would bet that Trump is going to win by a really Slim margin um because I ultimately I think that structural um you know vote for something different really matters and it seems to me that the Harris Democrats are playing defense and Trump's playing offense and on balance uh defense doesn't turn out the voter as effectively but those are very soft thesis in um in an environment where everything is within the margin of error so I I don't like like your other friends Scott I don't I don't have a strong um I don't have a strong view I I I could I could easily be surprised on this one I think we're all going to be I'm more worried about the disinformation environment I'm more worried about how Americans I mean you're right that the two candidates are so different because the people that are supporting the two candidates believe completely different things and it's getting worse and worse and worse every day and we see it in our mainstream media Lord knows we see it in our social media um I mean we even saw it in the response to FEMA and the hurricane we saw in response to the pandemic and now it's in our election if you're a Dem or a Republican um your views of what matters and what is true has never been more different than your fellow Americans since the Civil War um and I think that's what's driving these candidates being so radically different and that bodess badly for what happens to the US after next Tuesday well just going back to incentives and this will be my last question or thesis the dangerous thing about an autocracy and why it's so effective is that I see it again Jeff Bezos it appears was incentivized or fored supposedly a representative of one of his companies was meeting with Trump and there was pressure applied to someone you would think would would be immune from pressure in a capitalist Society being the third or fourth wealthiest person in the world and the story running around was that he was essentially pressured into pressuring The Washington Post to not issue an endorsement and this is the danger I see of an autocracy that the upside of supporting this person or supporting each of them I don't want to say it's bigger with an autocracy is you get the sense he's a bit of a kleptocrat and will do money good for you regardless of the Constitution or the doj to pay you back and on the flip side go out of his way to use the full power uh and influence of the government to prosecute his political enemies whereas if you don't support Harris the downside I see is much less because I think she has respect for the law and she's not going to go after her political opponents they might not get appointed to be Ambassador but she's not going to weaponize the doj against them so all of the incentives on a risk adjusted basis I you know I see these heads of investment Banks I know they support Harris but I keep seeing them hedge their bets because they're worried that Trump would be more punitive and loss than Harris I see this as just I never recognize just how effective autocracy is the perception of a lack of concern for the law your thoughts yeah and and it's because people are insufficiently EV valuing the importance of democratic institutions and rule of law those are long-term things that they don't care enough about um and America's really good capitalism is really good at Short valuing short-term things um but not long-term things not public goods not negative externalities um and I mean you remember after January 6th there were a lot of American CEOs that finally said you know what we've got to Value this if you were a member of Congress and you refuse to certify a free and fair election those are table Stakes for democracy we're just not going to our packs aren't going to give you money anymore that's it and you and I know a lot of the CEOs that made those decisions and I I was glad they did it that didn't even last a year and it's not because those members of Congress apologized and changed their behavior it's because he well you know it's kind of convenient we want to like give him money again and you know let's get in the game and we you know our competitors are going to do it and it was such tweny Behavior you know it was I mean again this is from someone these are from companies that didn't need to do it Jeff Bezos doesn't need he is wealthy enough powerful enough he can stand up you know it wasn't comfortable or convenient for me um to uh to go after Elon when he did something that I thought was really problematic he's not an enemy I need believe it uh but I I can't live with myself uh if I can't be honest about what I think on the global political stage like that's just who I am and if I lose money for that who gives a it doesn't matter I lose a client for that I don't care but you know I do think that if you spend all of your time I mean maybe the problem with a person like Bezos is once you become that rich the only way you become that rich is by that becoming the only thing you value right it shows that money is the only thing that is truly important for you that is that is what you Orient all of your time and being towards and if that's true there's not much space in your value set for valuing democracy rule of law a community a family any of those things um and and therefore you know having his guys get the meeting and you know telling the people at the Washington Post to go scratch it does reflect who he actually is as a person U but you know we as America are incenting a lot of the wrong kinds of behavior by lionizing someone like that as a captain of USA because they are not leading by example that's pretty clear Ian Bremer is the president and founder of Eurasia group the world's leading political risk research and consulting
