# 1-Person Business Thrives Bad Economy

Published: 2025-11-27

The US economy is sitting on a knife's edge. You've got economists are giving it a 39% chance of dipping into a full-blown recession in 2026. But you don't need an economist to tell you that. You probably feel it every day, right? Is that quiet pressure of where your dollars are like buying you less. You're having to work harder. And it ultimately feels like you're falling behind. But the real trap isn't the recession that everyone sees coming. It's the one hiding underneath. Because right now, the entire stock market is being propped up by a handful of giant tech companies. And they've created what many are calling an AI bubble. And if that one domino falls, it could cascade down and take everything else with it. So with this on the horizon, it's on each of us to prepare. So what if you could build something that's not going to be a victim of this storm, but is actually made stronger by it. A oneperson business that provides a safe harbor in an uncertain world like we're headed into. Well, right now that is possible for everyone with a brain, computer, and an internet connection. And in this video, I'm going to be revealing firstly what this proven yet untapped opportunity is. And secondly, how to start one step by step broken down whether you're a student, an employee, or just curious about what this is. And if we haven't met, my name is Liam Otley, and a few years ago, I started one of these businesses with zero experience. And this year, it's generated over $7 million for me. So, I've also helped thousands of other people to start one of these businesses through my free content here on YouTube. The blueprint I'm about to give you is the same one that I would use if I was starting from zero again today. So, let's get into it. So, that's what we're going for here. We're getting a blueprint for a business that can weather the storm that's coming. But before I show you how to build that boat, you need to understand who the storm hits the hardest. Because in every economic downturn, there is a playbook. When the pressure hits, large companies do what they've always done. They squeeze their teams to do more with less. They freeze hiring. They cut their projects. Maybe you've seen this at your own job, the the sudden budget cuts or the restructuring memos that go around. It's a predictable cycle that's designed to protect their bottom line, often at the expense of the people who are actually doing the work for them. But the real story, the one that really affects all of us, isn't just about the employees. It's about the engine of the entire economy. There are 33 million small businesses in America. They are the lifeblood. That's your local coffee shop, the plumber who fixes your sink, the familyrun restaurant on the corner. They create 60% of all new jobs, and they represent nearly half of the entire US economy. But unlike the giants, they don't have billions of dollars of cash reserves sitting in the bank to ride the storm out. They don't have teams of analysts. They are the leaky boats in this perfect storm that we're headed into. And they are always going to be the first that go under. And when these businesses fail, it's not just a line on the spreadsheet. It's like a wound in the community. It's the jobs your friends and neighbors rely on. This is the reality of the storm. And these are the stakes. And so in a world where even these old boats are leaking. So how do you find that safe harbor? How do you build a business that doesn't just survive the storm, but actually uses the winds to sail faster? Well, to do that, you need to ignore the panic. And you have to ask one simple strategic question. In a recession, where does the money actually go? Because it doesn't just disappear. I mean, some of the stock value, of course, it does, but it mainly it moves. It gets redirected. And if you know where it's going, you can be there waiting for it. So, over the years, businesses have developed a predictable response to this kind of economic pressure that's coming. You can think of it as the recession playbook. The first play is always the same. It's cut the fat. They're going to slash spending on anything that is nice to have, anything that doesn't have a clear and immediate and undeniable impact on the business. This is the part of the playbook that causes fear because it's where most of the layoffs happen. But there is a second and more important play that most people never see. The businesses take the money that they just saved and they reinvest it. They double down on things that are musthaves for survival of the company. And what is the number one must have in a recession? It's efficiency. Anything that helps them to do more with less. Any tool or service or strategy that can help them use their existing team to be more productive, can cut out wasted time or can automate a costly process becomes an essential investment for them in this time. It's not a luxury in this case. It's a lifeline for them to get to the other side. And so what is the single most powerful tool on planet Earth right now that allows businesses to do more with less? It's artificial intelligence or AI. This is a secret. In a downturn, AIdriven efficiency isn't just a tech trend. It's an economic necessity. It's one of the safest places for businesses to put their money. It is the safe harbor. So, we found it. We know that businesses will be desperately looking to spend money on AI that delivers a clear return on their investment. But that leads us to the next and crucial question. With all the hype and the thousands of tools and the fears of an AI bubble, how do you know which specific AI services and tools are a guaranteed safe bet? And which ones are just going to be a waste of time? Well, to answer that, you need to look at the data. So, we found our safe harbor. We know that in a downturn, businesses will desperately pay for AI services that deliver efficiency, allow them to do more with less. But this is where most people get scared off. They hear AI business and they immediately think of some complex coding and development and being like an AI PhD. And that kind of stuff can be a very tough place to start. So, let me show you the data. Recently, two major studies came out that seemed to paint a confusing picture. We had a report from MIT that found that a shocking 95% of custom AI projects fail to make any money or return a positive ROI for the company that invested in it. But then a new study from the Wharton School of Business found that 75% of companies are seeing a positive ROI from AI. So, what's the real story here? Well, who's telling the truth? When you look a little bit closer, you do find the truth. And that 95% failure rate is almost exclusively for these giant enterprise companies trying to build massive complex and custom AI systems from scratch. So for a beginner, we can call that like the deep end of the pool, right? It's a very difficult and dangerous place to start when you're selling AI. More importantly for us, that 75% success rate comes from businesses getting quick and easy wins with simple and off-the-shelf AI tools and good training to show the teams how to use it. The lesson is clear, and that's that the path to success starts where the wins are easiest. You begin with simple solutions for small businesses. So this is your blueprint. This is your strategic on-ramp into AI and I call it the AI transformation partner light model. So my company Morningside AI, we are a full AI transformation partner. We handle everything for our clients from AI education and training to AI auditing and finding the best use cases to custom AI development and beyond. But you guys aren't going to start there. Of course, you will start with this light version. And it's the perfect foot in your door to get into the space of selling some kind of AI service. So first you offer something like an AI tools audit. So, you act basically as a consultant who finds the best simple AI tools for local businesses to save them ton money. I've got a full guide on how to do this which I'm going to be sharing with you guys at the end. Secondly, you offer team training. You teach their employees how to use the tools that you've set up or just generic things like chatbt effectively through things like a workshop or just creating basic course material for them to watch. And thirdly, you can essentially be a setup partner. You can help them set up and implement these existing AI tools that you recommend and make sure that the teams are using them properly. And this stuff requires no coding at So, I hope you can see that this is probably a lot easier than you thought, right? This is your on-ramp. It's how you start conversations. It's how you build trust with your clients and generate your first revenue with these lowrisk and in high demand services. And getting your first client is a lot easier than you think as well. And I'm going to be sharing my full guide to getting your first client 30 days at the end, which has been proven to work time and time again for basically any beginner who tries it. But what we've been over so far is really just the beginning. It's it's your foot in the door. Remember, the AI tools audit and helping them to find the best tools and then the AI training to teach their teams how to use that. This stuff is just the tip of the ramp. And this on-ramp leads you to where ultimately the real money is made, especially in the recession, because once you're the trusted AI guide and you've pointed out these tools and you've trained their teams, you can then move into no code AI automation development. And so here it's all about building critical systems that automate key parts of their business like parts of their customer support system or sales follow-up or lead generation. And this is how we get clients on long-term retainers because when you set this up correctly, you now run an essential part of their operations. And this is what ultimately makes you truly recession proof. You become a must have in the business, an essential system. And if this sounds complex, don't worry. I'm going to be giving you my entire free blueprint that breaks down how to get started with the simple offers first. So, just stick with me. Now, I know exactly what you're thinking because we just went through that blueprint and there's a voice in your head saying, "Liam, this all sounds good, but I'm not a tech person. I'm not an expert. I'm not qualified to do this. I don't have a a PhD in AI." You have this image of what an AI expert is some kind of code or a developer who's had years and years in the field. Well, we need to erase that picture, at least for now, because the role here is actually much simpler. You can think of yourself as a guide. You don't need to have read the entire book on AI. You just need to be one chapter ahead of the person that you're trying to help. And I can tell you firsthand that these clients, these local business owners that you're going to be helping are still on chapter one, hell, like even chapter zero. They're not even like into the book yet when it comes to understanding what AI is, what AI tools are out there, and the best ones that they should be using. Naturally, they are too busy running their own companies to even open that book up. So your job is to read to chapter two and then turn around and then explain to them what chapters one and two are about in simple terms. And another key thing is that you're not the first person to walk this path. You're not a guinea pig in trying one of these businesses. There are thousands and thousands of people from every background imaginable that have started this journey through watching my free content over the past 3 years. People who were baristas, truck drivers, and students and stay-at-home parents. And I mean I even started my journey myself with zero AI experience 3 years ago. So this entire light model of the ARTP model is the blueprint that I just showed you. And it was designed for this exact purpose. It's the proven on-ramp into the AI space that allows you to build your knowledge and your income at the same time just with baby steps at the start and solving these simple problems for small businesses that you can help without needing to have some fancy degree or 10 years experience in AI. You start off at the bottom of the ramp and you build confidence by helping a local business to pick a handful of tools that they can get value out of. And this is ultimately how you learn to be the captain. And you're not trying to build the entire ship on day one. But by learning how to navigate one of these problems one simple step at a time, you will get there eventually. So now let me show you exactly how to get started on your journey. So this journey of building your own safe harbor does not start with a giant leap. We've said that, right? Starting with a single simple step. And so to make this as easy as possible for you guys, I've put together an entire blueprint that lays out this AITP light model step by step. And it's going to be completely free with this video. It's going to be waiting inside my free school community, which is the biggest AI business community in the world.

And I'll also include a breakdown of the different training offers you can sell to businesses like workshops or courses. So everything you need to take your first step is in there. And look, the economic storm is coming, at least according to the economist. And it's a force of nature that we may not be able to control. You can be tossed around by the waves and just be another victim of the system that feels rigged against us.
