# Time Horizon Advantage

> The person with the longest time horizon wins.

## The Principle

The only remaining arbitrage of value exists for people willing to wait and endure longer than competition.

Most people optimize for short-term. Those who can genuinely think in years and decades have massive competitive advantage.

## Examples

| Person | Time Horizon | Result |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Elon Musk | Lifetime (rockets since age 7) | Richest person |
| Hormozi | 3-5 years | Very wealthy, but "shorter horizon" |
| Most entrepreneurs | 60 days | Quit when content "doesn't work" |

## Requirements

Time horizon must be "reverse-engineered to some level of reality":
- Not wishful thinking
- Connected to actual milestones
- Financially survivable

## The Prerequisites

You can't have long time horizon when:
- Bills are due and you can't pay them
- Personal finances are chaotic
- Survival mode

**First**: Get to $100K-$1M (survival)
**Then**: Buy breathing room to think longer

## Content Application

> "People try content for 60 days and say 'this didn't work.' Well yeah, because you did it for 60 days. Try it for 60 months and then see what happens."

Brand/content is a lifetime asset. Those who play 60 months win; those who play 60 days lose.
