# Dont Sell AI Tools Sell These 3 AI Agents

In this enlightening video, Liam Ottley delves into the art of building a successful AI-focused business, advocating for a strategic approach that prioritizes specialized AI agents over generalized tool sales.

## Core Thesis

This methodology emphasizes understanding and solving client pain points directly, rather than inundating them with technical jargon.

## Key Insights
