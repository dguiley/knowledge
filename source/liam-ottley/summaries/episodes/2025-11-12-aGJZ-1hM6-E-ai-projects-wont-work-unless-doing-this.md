# AI Projects Won't Work Unless Doing This

In this episode, Liam Ottley explores the challenges and opportunities within AI project implementations, offering insights into achieving success and avoiding potential pitfalls.

## Core Thesis
The success of AI projects heavily depends on understanding the distinctive challenges between custom and general AI solutions. While general AI tools can be rapidly deployed with high ROI, custom development poses significant hurdles that necessitate a strategic approach, upskilled talent, external collaboration, and clear communication on investment.

## Key Insights
- A striking difference exists between studies on AI ROI: MIT highlights a 95% failure rate for custom AI projects, while Wharton shows a 75% positive ROI from general AI tools.
- General AI like ChatGPT and Copilot have a high adoption rate (82%), providing workflow improvements by augmenting rather than replacing human capabilities.
- External partners are twice as likely to succeed in implementing AI projects, emphasizing the value of collaboration.
- There's a significant demand for AI talent, particularly in development roles.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Distinguish between general and custom AI when devising a strategy, prioritizing training for staff to integrate AI into workflows effectively.
2. Agencies should focus on offering custom AI solutions alongside transparent pricing to depict the real investments required.
3. Engage with smaller companies for faster ROI and fewer complexities.
4. Position businesses as AI transformation partners, helping clients address both immediate needs and long-term strategic goals.

## Notable Quotes
> "The actual difficulty of getting custom development and truly transformative AI plugged into companies is still very difficult."

> "You need to make sure you are charging more than you think because these optimization phases could take a while."
