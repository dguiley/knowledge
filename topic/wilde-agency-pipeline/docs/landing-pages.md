# Landing Pages - Wilde Agency

Applying PEACE framework to both tracks.

---

## The Decision: Main Persona

You need to pick ONE as the primary landing page. The other becomes secondary.

| Factor | Venture Studio (Startups) | AI Transformation (Business) |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Volume** | Higher (more startups) | Lower (fewer, bigger) |
| **Qualification** | Harder (many unqualified) | Easier (have money, real problems) |
| **Deal Size** | Variable ($25K-150K) | Larger ($75K-200K+) |
| **Sales Cycle** | Shorter | Longer |
| **Competition** | Heavy (every agency) | Light (they don't know who to call) |
| **Your Passion** | Higher? (venture mission) | Lower? (client work) |
| **Channel** | LinkedIn, startup world | Different (trade shows? referrals?) |

**Recommendation:** Lead with Venture Studio (it's your mission), but build AI Transformation as serious secondary with distinct funnel.

## Landing Page 1: Venture Studio Pilot

### Controlling Idea Options
Pick one:

1. **"Skip the scaffolding"** - Technical, specific
2. **"Weeks, not months"** - Speed-focused
3. **"Experience × AI"** - Differentiation-focused
4. **"Production-ready from day one"** - Outcome-focused

### PEACE Sound Bites (Draft)

**P - Problem:**
> "Most startups burn 6 months and half their runway building scaffolding—auth, payments, infra—before writing a line of product code."

**E - Empathy:**
> "We've been there. As CTOs of three startups, we've watched founders run out of runway solving problems that were already solved."

**A - Answer:**
> "Apply to our Venture Studio. We build on a battle-tested foundation—30 years of patterns, accelerated by AI."

**C - Change:**
> "Go from idea to production-ready software in weeks."

**E - End Result:**
> "So you can focus on customers and growth, not infrastructure and tech debt."

### Oneliner
> "Most startups burn 6 months building scaffolding before writing product code. We skip that. Our Venture Studio builds on a production-ready foundation—so you launch in weeks, not months."

### Landing Page Structure

```
[Hero Section]
HEADLINE: Stop Burning Runway on Scaffolding
SUBHEAD: Our Venture Studio builds your product on a foundation
         that took 30 years to refine. Launch in weeks, not months.
CTA: Apply for Q1 Pilot →

[Problem Section]
"Most startups waste their first 6 months..."
- Building auth systems from scratch
- Configuring CI/CD pipelines
- Setting up monitoring and logging
- Creating patterns that already exist

Meanwhile, competitors with experienced teams ship product.

[Empathy Section]
"We've been there."
As CTOs of 3 startups, we watched founders run out of
runway solving problems that were already solved.

So we built something different.

[Solution Section]
THE VENTURE STUDIO
- Battle-tested foundation (skip months of setup)
- Senior engineering (not junior devs learning on your dime)
- AI-accelerated (experience × AI = exponential output)
- Limited slots (we take X projects per quarter)

[How It Works]
1. Apply → Tell us about your project
2. Select → We choose projects that fit
3. Build → Production-ready in weeks
4. Launch → Focus on customers, not infrastructure

## Landing Page 2: AI Transformation

### Controlling Idea Options
Pick one:

1. **"Build without becoming a software company"** - Identity-focused
2. **"Custom software, no tech team"** - Outcome-focused
3. **"Compete with anyone"** - Aspiration-focused
4. **"Modernize without the headache"** - Pain-focused

### PEACE Sound Bites (Draft)

**P - Problem:**
> "Your competitors are automating everything. You know you need software to keep up—but you can't hire developers, and you don't want to become a tech company."

**E - Empathy:**
> "We hear this every day from business owners who built something great without technology, and now feel like they're falling behind."

**A - Answer:**
> "Tell us what you need. We build it for you. No hiring. No management. No becoming something you're not."

**C - Change:**
> "Get the custom software your business needs."

**E - End Result:**
> "So you can compete with anyone—without a tech team."

### Oneliner
> "A lot of business owners know they need software to compete, but they can't hire developers and don't want to become a tech company. We build it for you—so you get the tools you need without the tech headache."

### Landing Page Structure

         no hiring, no management, no becoming a tech company.

## Homepage Decision

If you need ONE homepage, options:

**Option A: Startup-First**
Lead with Venture Studio messaging, secondary link to "For Established Businesses"

**Option B: Split Test**
Route traffic to different pages, see which converts

**Option C: Chooser**
```
Which describes you?

[I'm building a startup]     [I run an established business]
     ↓                              ↓
 Venture Studio               AI Transformation
```

**Option D: Unified Hero**
Find messaging that works for both (harder):
"We build software that wins. Whether you're launching something new or modernizing what you have."

---

## Priorities

1. **Venture Studio page first** - Your core mission
2. **Refine sound bites** - Test in conversations
3. **AI Transformation second** - Build when you identify channel
4. **Homepage chooser** - Once both pages exist

---

## Open Questions

1. **Pilot structure:** Equity? LOI? Discount? Cohort?
2. **Slots:** How many per quarter? Real or manufactured?
3. **AI Transformation channel:** Where do these business owners find you?
4. **Pricing visibility:** Show prices on page or only after call?
