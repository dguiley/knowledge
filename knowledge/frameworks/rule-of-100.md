# Rule of 100

> Commit to 100 repetitions (or 100 days) before evaluating whether something works.

## The Reframe

Wrong question: "Does this work?"
Right question: "How much do I need to do for this to work for me?"

Answer: Always more than you want to do.

## Why 100

1. First attempts at anything are bad
2. Skill compounds with repetitions
3. 100 reps provides enough data AND enough skill
4. Most people quit at 10-20 reps and conclude "it doesn't work"

By rep 100, most people see material results because they got good enough at the tactic to make it work.

## Applications

| Domain | 100 Reps Means |
|--------|----------------|
| Outreach | 100 personalized messages |
| Content | 100 posts/videos |
| Sales calls | 100 conversations |
| Cold email | 100 sends before changing approach |

## The Casino Analogy

> Imagine playing one hand of blackjack, losing, leaving, and saying "gambling doesn't work."

That's what entrepreneurs do:
- Try outbound for a week → "outbound doesn't work"
- Post 10 times → "content doesn't work"
- Make 5 sales calls → "sales calls don't work"

### B. Related Concepts

- Frustration tolerance (the skill that makes 100 reps possible)
- Speed of iteration (why volume compounds)
- Constraint bombing (applying volume to specific problems)
