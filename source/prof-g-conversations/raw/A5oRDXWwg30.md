places like Austin Denver Nashville a lot of the Sunbelt metros have historically been really affordable they build a lot of housing when there's more demand and prices haven't gone up that sort of broke in the pandemic and it's unclear whether that's a short-term problem lots of people moving away from California to places like Phoenix because they could buy cheaper homes maybe this is going to correct itself the worry is that some of those places are going to become more like California [Music] Jenny where does this podcast find you I'm in my office in Arnold Ventures uh we're close to downtown DC all right so you recently joined Arnold Ventures where you're addressing the nation's challenge of housing supply shortages and rapidly increasing rents and home prices let's talk about this uh headon how can we repair America's broken housing systems well the policy side is actually not that complicated we need to make it easier to build bu housing and build more types of housing especially in high demand locations it turns out that the tricky part of this is the politics we've essentially delegated a lot of control over housing production to local governments and to neighborhoods and people who live in a neighborhood often don't want to have more housing built my sense is and you tell me if this is correct the incumbents the people already own homes have a vested interest and not having more Supply so they get involved in local review boards and basically make it near impossible for for new housing permits is that a safe thesis it's true that there are at least some number of incumbent residents who don't want more housing and don't want their neighborhoods to change uh one of the questions we're sort of grappling with is how widespread is this resistance to new housing we're sort of uh ingrained to believe that nimbyism is widespread basically everybody who already owns a home doesn't want more housing but what we're starting to learn as we do more polling and surveys is that nism may not be as widespread as people thought before the nimes are loud and they're often very politically well connected but there often a lot of people including longtime homeowners who understand that their communities need to grow need to change and so part of the challenge is figuring out how to tell politicians that the this median voter may actually be comfortable with more growth than they've assumed yeah I think what's happening I think a lot of people have children who are looking who are either renting or looking for a home and they just realize how bad it's become what are some IDE ideas or Innovative policy Solutions or economic solutions for my understanding is it's a lot of it's a supply problem we just aren't building as many homes as we need to what are some policy ideas that you've seen that you think might address the issue there's sort of three buckets of policy changes that we know are likely to be effective uh one is just to make it possible to build a more diverse set of housing types so roughly three4 of the land even in major urban areas is set aside exclusively for single family Det attached homes those take up a lot of land they're the most expensive type to buy or to rent and they also just occupy a lot of space and so we have neighborhoods that are built out as single family homes and you can't add any more until you change the zoning so legalizing everything from tow houses accessory dwelling units all the way up to apartment buildings adds more capacity and more diversity to the housing stock we also have to look at sort of things like the dimensional requirements so uh legalizing an apartment building but capping it at two stories doesn't actually make it feasible so making it possible to build taller buildings smaller setbacks getting rid of off straight parking requirements all of those sort of details can matter and then probably the most important thing is actually the process we have gone to a system where there's a lot of complex discretionary approvals neighborhood by neighborhood uh gets to weigh in on what gets built to provide feedback on everything from the landscaping and the design the size of the project writing down a set of rules rules that are consistent and objective and letting developers build according to the rules without having this community engagement process that drags on forever would shorten the process and would allow more housing to get built more quickly which means that those units can then be sold or rented at lower prices yeah I have some experience with this firsthand I bought a piece of land down here in delway Florida and we were planning to develop on it and you have to go to the local review board and a woman showed up and said I don't know if I want that land developed I walk my dog over there and I'm like okay that's called trespassing but they delayed the decision for a month or three months these things don't meet that often to do some sort of review or study based on the fact this woman was walking her dog over there and it just felt like anyone who shows up can not not necessarily kill it but delay it forever so my question is I mean on a very reductive level my sense is permits have been taken out of the hands of officials who think big picture and put into the hands or at least of homeowners who can have a lot of influence and just delay this and everything I've done around this stuff or everything I've seen they basically it's just delay delay delay and any objection results in the delay of them finally issuing the permits what can be done because my sense is it's very state by state or even Community by Community how how do you address this is there some sort of federal law or state law that expedites if you will is a laxative to the constipation here of of housing permits yeah it there's very little the federal government can do uh the Constitution doesn't give the federal government control over land use or development or zoning uh so that's a power that's held by the states and sort of what we've seen is this delegation downwards States delegated land use authority to local governments local governments have in turn kind of outsourced this to individual neighborhoods either formally or informally um and so we've pushed the the approval process or at least the uh The veto power down to the lowest level of geography and the people who are most impacted by it so you know one thing that local governments can do is just move the timing of when you get community engagement instead of doing this for every single permit every single parcel that gets changed move it Upstream to something like the comprehensive planning process so like every 10 years the city comes together and says Where do we want to grow what do we want to add and once that's written down in the plan then you don't get to protest every single development in every project that would make things a little easier one Trend we've seen in the last five or six years is that state governments are starting to reclaim some of the power they delegated to localities because states are recognizing the real economic harms of not building enough housing if you look at places like California and Massachusetts and New York the state level economy can't grow they can't attract and retain enough workers because there isn't housing that's affordable different kinds of income levels and so state governments are starting to put guard rails around what localities can do setting quantitative targets for how many homes they have to allow or telling them you're not allowed to ban for instance apartment buildings near Transit stations so I think this is a really promising Trend because state governments do have this bigger picture economic impact um and they have the power if they want to use it to push back against all of the local nimes I think I've heard people reference the Mayors in Austin and minneap Apolis are trying to be Innovative around expanding the housing stock or the the stock of housing a do you know anything specifically about those or can you point to other examples of where local officials are have shown leadership around this issue yeah those are both good examples Minneapolis was the first city to legalize duplexes and triplexes in all of its residential neighborhoods which is kind of a modest step it's a little bit more symbolic um but they also did a lot of up zoning around their new light rail system so it's very easy and straightforward to build apartments near the transit stations in Minneapolis and they've in fact built a lot of apartments nearby and that's been very helpful to providing more Supply Austin is just a growth friendly City uh I was there in February of this year and they're cranes everywhere they are building building building you know Austin has really embraced the sort of change from being kind of a smallish city college town to being a big city in its own right and a lot of what this is telling us is if elected officials want more housing to get built they'll figure out ways to make it happen if elected officials don't want to build housing they'll figure out ways to stop it I noticed the same thing when I was in Austin that they have this sort of growth mindset what about the idea I'm could the chips act be a role or be a model and that as they just said we're going to provide subsidies to inspire more domestic manufacturing of key semiconductor technology what about just straight subsidies that say to a developer if you figure out a way to navigate these local zoning laws and build more than 8 10 12 units will give you 3 5 10% tax credit I mean the problem isn't that developers don't want to build it's that they can't uh and that developers don't control the development process so you know there's there's always a worry about subsidizing either demand or giving subsidy to uh to Providers to developers without relaxing the rules may just wind up driving up prices even more let's zoom out give us your impression of some of the housing Trends by Market because people would say you know it's difficult to I think make statements about housing across the us because housing in St Louis I would imagine is entirely different situation than it is in Phoenix or San Francisco if you are as a as a housing analyst what markets do you think reflect the most strength right now the most weakness what types of uh real estate or asset classes are you keeping your eye on give us sort of break down if you will give us a lay of the land but be more segmented by region and property tipes so in the last five years or so since really since the start of the pandemic we've seen affordability go from being mostly a regional problem in the high cost Coastal markets to being almost a national problem and it's not as acute everywhere but you know California Seattle Boston New York for something like 40 years have been underbuilding and have been very expensive and that's just sort of baked into expectations places like Austin Denver Nashville a lot of the Sunbelt metros have historically been really affordable they build a lot of housing when there's more demand and prices haven't gone up that sort of broke in the pandemic and it's unclear whether that's a short-term problem lots of people moving away from California to places like Phoenix uh because they could buy cheaper homes maybe this is going to correct itself the worry is that some of those places are going to become more like California you know if Austin and Phoenix start making it harder to build and in the long run they stay expensive that's going be a real problem for a lot of people it is certainly still true that a lot of the traditional sort of Rust Belt metros St Louis Cleveland Pittsburgh I mean housing is still objectively a lot cheaper there than it is in most of the country um but those places are also seeing tightening so we're seeing uh you know Pittsburgh is redoing their comprehensive plan now they've seen vacancy rates drop in a way that they're not used to seeing and are trying to figure out how do we get out in front of this so we've seen this sort of geographic conver in a sense and spillover looking at sort of different kinds of uh of home types the single family home building completely collapsed in the Great Recession people couldn't get qualified for mortgages developers couldn't get money to build and so if you if you map single family permits and multif family permits they both dropped off a cliff in the Great Recession multif family has picked up a lot and single family has just not gotten back to the levels that it was some of this is that you know you need more land to build single family there's a lot of demand for living in the urban core where their amenities and that there you're going to be building more multif family but some of it also seems to be that it's just harder for people to qualify for mortgages than it used to be and so there's less building of single family that's designed for especially entry-level home ownership do you think that young people not being able to pursue quote-unquote the American dream is leading to our polarization and dissatisfaction with uh life in America it defin doesn't help when I talk to people under the age of 40 they are really pessimistic about their ability to buy a house in a neighborhood that's close to jobs and amenities um and you know people are just sort of resigned I'm going to be a renter forever which isn't necessarily terrible right if there's good quality rental housing in neighborhoods that you like being a renter allows you to be more flexible to move someplace for another job but we're so conditioned to believe that sort of part of becoming an adult uh is buying a house and having part of the American dream and Building Wealth and so people who feel like that's not going to be a possibility are really embittered and not feeling like the system is working for them do you think we need to break out of this kind of zeitgeist that you've failed as an adult or you're not that AC successful unless you own my podcast co-host on my other pod raging moderates is successful she and her husband make really good money they live in New York and they've made the conscious decision to leave their money in the market as opposed to put it you know buying a very expensive place in Tribeca or wherever because they've said the yield it's just a it's just not economic it's a better deal to rent than to buy do you think we just need a change in mentality or mindset so I think we should be a lot more honest about the financial risks and downsides of owning uh you know there's a long tradition among our uh elected officials from both parties of pushing this idea that home ownership is the American dream and we should get people into home ownership as quickly as possible and renting a sort of second class status I will say that for a lot of people the the benef biggest benefit of home ownership is not that you're going to build a ton of wealth through the equity but that you have stability and predictability of your housing payments for a fairly long period of time so if you rent every year when your lease rolls over the landlord can raise the rent if you own the principal and interest on the on the mortgage are fixed over generally 30 years one of the things that's coming up though with climate change is that property insurance and property taxes are going up faster because local governments have to pay for a lot of these repairs and insurance companies are raising rates pretty quickly that makes home ownership a little bit less attractive as just a sort of stability of your housing payment system um you know it's really important that before people buy a home that they look at where else they could be investing their money in a lot of markets particularly these sort of Midwestern cities the stock market would have performed better than putting your money in real estate and having it all in a down payment you know it's inherently risky to invest all of your savings in one piece of property in one location in the same Regional job market where you work so there's there's a lot of risk involved and we haven't really been that upfront with people about it and generally speaking looking at the yields or the ratio of rent to ownership is it generally speaking better to rent now Across the Nation or have rents kept pace with the same escalation in home prices that really varies across markets um so places like Austin that have built a ton of housing rent inflation topped out during the pandemic and has slowed and some of them are actually seeing softening of rents you might be able to get say one or two months free rent when you sign a new lease but in places like California and New York that have not built enough housing rents continue to go up much faster than income so it's still the case that home ownership is a better deal financially in some markets than others and what about in these kind of climate affected areas where people can't get insurance how is that impacting the housing market we're just starting to see that now um Florida is certainly Ground Zero for this uh insurance premiums are going up on owner occupied properties and going up on rental properties so landlords are having to pay higher rates as well in some places people are going to have a hard time getting insurance at all or the insurance is not going to cover the full replacement cost if there's damage you know we are seeing some people who just choose CH not to have insurance so if you don't have a mortgage nobody forces you to buy property insurance and you may just go without uh we see unfortunately a lot of that among some of the older mobile home parks um because people don't have to they don't have a mortgage they don't have to have insurance but then they have nothing when a disaster strikes we may also see some wealthy people who just choose to fully self-insure if you have a lot of money saved up and you really want to live close to the ocean you might be willing to live there and just accept that you're going to have to rebuild your house from time to time and pay for it out of pocket we'll be right back so back in 2022 you spoke with Ezra Klein about how Progressive States struggle more with homelessness why do you think that is and why haven't things changed you just I mean you just hear so much about the home I well I I see it when I'm in Seattle when I'm on these West Coast quote unquote Progressive cities you just see such extraordinary such an extraordinary homeless problem why is that many of the progressive cities and states are the ones that have made it the most difficult to build housing fundamentally the number of homeless people is a function the number of people who can't afford the rent of the mortgage so expensive places have higher rates of homelessness um people are falling into homelessness much faster because they're housing unstable and they're spending a lot of money on income there's this weird relationship with why Progressive places have made it the hardest to build some of this goes back to some of the big social trends the 1960s and' 70s giving communi is a voice in what gets built and in what gets torn down very much comes out of a reaction to urban renewal you know the federal government tore down a bunch of black and brown neighborhoods and cities to run highways uh into the downtown areas and they didn't talk to the communities that were displaced right the federal government just came in and took your house and tore it down and ran in a highway so the sort ofunity the empowerment comes out of a reaction to that in California uh California was the first state to pass a Statewide Environmental Protection Law uh squa which initially was supposed to protect environmentally vulnerable places but now has really become weaponized so that people can sue to stop a bik lane or infill development or affordable housing on the grounds that it's going to create more traffic or that's going to you disturb their view so a lot of the sort of good impulses in the Progressive Movement have now been weaponized by some of the most affluent and well-organized communities to stop poor people and to block projects often that have big environmental benefits and there's been a lot of controversy about institutional buyers coming in buying up apartments or housing and one do you see it as a bad thing or is it just additional source of capital that it should Inspire more Supply so I don't think we should worry about the sort of legal entities that are buying housing as much as we worry about the ways that housing is being provided uh there are sort of a couple of reasonable push backs against private equity in particular buying up homes one is that in some cases they've not been great landlords they they provide poor quality housing they don't fix maintenance issues they're not responsive to their tenants um and you know tenants have a right to good quality housing and good treatment but that's true whether your landlord is a private Equity Firm or a mom and pops landlord or for that matter a public housing agency or a nonprofit and we should enforce these rules across all kinds of landlords there's also been concern that private Equity has a lot of cash and when they go in and they're buying up properties for cash they can out compete firsttime home buyers who need to get a mortgage again understand that that's definitely a pain point but then we should also worry about things like Boomers who are retiring and selling their primary home and using cash to buy a second home if it's cash buyers then again this applies across all different kinds of entities so my sense is we're scapegoating private equity because it's a convenient villain but even if you banned all of private Equity from buying up housing that wouldn't alleviate the housing shortage and that wouldn't reduce rents and prices by very much and I think people forget didn't a lot of the institutional buyers get basically their face ripped off and had to sell these things at a loss creating more cheap Supply doesn't it swing both ways when you have institutional buyers it does some of them are good at buying at the bottom and selling at the top and others mtime the market just like any other investor in the wake of the Great Recession there were a number of markets that had really high vacancies and a lot of foreclosures and remember that nobody could get a mortgage and so you had to have cash to be able to buy a bunch of the big institutional investors went into neighborhoods that had foreclosed and boarded up homes and bought them and at least rehabed them enough to be habitable got renters in so they stabilized some of the neighborhoods that were hardest hit you may argue you know we'd like them to sell to homeowners once the mortgage markets loosen up but they did perform a really important service because they have access to Capital when other people don't what do you think of these sort of cities and startups where and my understanding is there's certain big swasa land in California and other states that have been Incorporated by investors and my understanding is one of the motivations or the opportunities they see is a lack of zoning and the ability to just you know kind of build baby build what do you think of these sort of startup cities so there's a big one outside of uh the Bay Area that's gotten a lot of political push back uh my my sense is part of the problem there is that there was there was intentional secrecy on the front end uh so they were buying up a lot of land and trying to develop plans for this without revealing who was behind it um and that comes across as secretive and undemocratic and so people are kind of nervous about this we do have older examples of planned cities so celebration in Florida Columbia Maryland Reston uh Town Center in Virginia where there was a big master plan City many of those are lovely places to build and people want to be in a place that has housing and restaurants and public space and Parks um and there's some efficiencies to doing these in kind of large scale we see that also within neighborhoods within cities you know in Washington DC where I live a number of the big new neighborhoods around Union Market and the Navy yards ballpark those were done as big master plan communities so those can be really nice places and you have some economies of scale in the INF structure provided I think the sort of concern of are private companies doing this going to be accountable to voters is worth a conversation I'm also a little skeptical that you can build a city and fill it with tenants who won't at some point then want to take control over the Democratic process uh so maybe you build you know forever California 10 years down the line the people who've moved in there decide they'd actually don't want to continue building housing and they turn into nimes that strikes me as a very plausible outcome down the line when I look at the impacts in the economy coming out of covid it feels like the real structural enduring change is remote work more so in the US than in Europe and other parts of the world that where you see vacancy rates are back to kind of the normal levels in commercial real estate but in the US it seems that a lot of people have gotten very used to remote work is there perhaps just an entire structural shift that will step change up the value of housing because people are just spending a lot more of their waking hours in their home yes and we have probably seen some of that already uh so there's some good research that shows that about 20% of the increase in prices nationally is due to remote work by high income workers so it's not just that people are working from home but it's the most affl workers who want more space to have a home office or just more space to spread out and they're really driving that um so in you know in Metro areas with higher rates of work from home we see bigger spikes in housing prices I will say that there sort of a flip side which is the opportunity from reimagining a lot of the office heavy downtowns it's not quick and easy to convert an office building into residential but this does open up more buildings and in some of the city centers that have a lot of amenities it's probably going to take 5 to 10 years before we see substantial numbers of homes and they're not going to be cheap but that does mean that we've got some places we can reimagine and I realize this isn't your domain but I can't resist asking any thoughts you know about a year ago there was all of this speculation that some of the second tier Regional Banks were going to go out of business because they had all this commercial real estate on their balance sheet and it doesn't feel as if we've seen the Meltdown we've seen vacancy rates be stubbornly high in commercial real estate but we haven't seen the sort of meltdown similar to the subprime crisis in 2008 that was being predicted in the commercial real estate market any thought thoughts on the state of commercial real estate right now that's going to look different across markets too um even for things like office vacancy and Retail vacancy some cities have held up better than others so you know places like San Francisco and New York still have some of the highest office vacancy rates but that's fundamentally very expensive land and somebody is going to figure out something to do with that land and those buildings to make money off of it um you know many of the the sort of the smaller markets you know the Sun Belt never had as much work from home and those office markets have held up much better Regional Banks tend to loan for both for acquisition and for development um and Loans on on uh commercial properties in their home region so you know maybe the regional banks that are lending on San Francisco real estate are going to take more of a hit but again those are pretty Diversified and big economies and so you know without speculating too much it's not clear that we're going to see a giant wave of bank failures primarily because of commercial real estate so just a couple thesis and I want you to respond to them one it feels as if so life happens death disease divorce that all of these homes with these kind of unexploded devices called a mortgage at 2 and a half% where they can't leave at some point as those mortgages start to come due or they need to turn them or refinance them at some point when you just got to move back to be closer to your aging parents or you need a bigger house there's my understanding is the housing we've never seen we're at kind of a historic trough in terms of housing sales right now do you see pent up demand and what might be like a a kind of a housing liquidity or sales boom uh in the next one to three years it just feels at some point the dam has to break or is this just a structural shift where people are going to stay in their homes for much longer people will move eventually uh people do decide they're they're just going to take the hit and they will move to something that's going to have a higher interest rate if they really need to so I think that's right um when people have life circumstances they will change interest rates will come down in the next couple of years we don't know how quickly and how far but that loosening up is probably going to open the spet a little bit and people will get more flexible the other option is that people do what they did in the Great Recession you have to move for a job related change or a family change but rather than sell your old house you rent it out so part of the uptick in single family rentals is actually just noral people who are renting out their other home that they used to live in curious to get your take on a specific type of property my thesis is that the fastest growing demographic is in seniors or Latinos it's billionaires or very very rich people I think incon of inequality is only going to get worse and you're going to continue to see the quotequote really aspirational high-end places whether it's you know certain parts of LA certain parts of New York although uh as someone who's owned in New York York the real estate market there's been kind of flat for the last decade but kind of the the 1% communities are going to outpace everywhere else just because of income in equality your thoughts we're seeing that in markets that really cater to high-end homes um so one of the other trends that came out of the pandemic was a real spike in demand for housing in places like Aspen in Upstate New York and a lot of the rural Resort communities and those are some of the hardest places to Grapple with this because you have very wealthy people buying vacation homes and homes with essentially no price cap and you also need to have a bunch of not very well-paid workers who serve in hospitality and Retail and Food Service who can't live anywhere close to there so I think those are sort of one of the the early examples that we're going to see this inequality you may get to some broader realization that we have to have Workforce housing for regional economies to work including in some of these resort areas and in major cities the regional economy just doesn't function well if you don't have enough housing middle income and for lower wage workers we may get to a Breaking Point in sort of political realization but I don't think we're quite there yet Dr Jenny schitz is a nationally renowned Economist author and policy expert on housing and land use she recently joined Arnold ventes as vice president of infrastructure for housing she joins us from her office in Washington DC I love how just sort of sober you are about this um really enjoyed the conversation it's such an important topic and we need more thought voic is weighing in appreciate your time thank you
