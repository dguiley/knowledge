well I think the issues that I've had really with AI and history or or history in the AI conversation has been that it's Focus primarily on the atomic bomb as an analogy there's a certain level of techn narcissism where every inventor of a technology wants to wants to convince you it's the single point of Savior for Humanity or the singular point of extermination of humanity doesn't it feel a little bit like this all this catastrophism is a bit narcissistic yes definitely I think everyone wants to be [Music] Oppenheimer barity where does this podcast find you I'm in New York at the moment you're in New York I'm usually based in London but I'm here for a talk in your uh W book AI needs you how we can change ai's future and save our own uh you write that when history enters the AI conversation it most often distorts rather than forms what do we get wrong about AI in terms of perception of it well I think the issues that I've had really with AI and history or or history in the AI conversation has been that it's focused primarily on the atomic bomb as an example as an analogy I don't think it's a helpful energy um for lots of different reasons I mean obviously the circumstances in which it's created are very unique um it's a weapon and but it's not really that I want to pick apart the like specific different ways that it's not like the atomic bomb it's more that if we're trying to sort of create a future path for AI That's beneficial and in defense of the public good something that is democratically controlled then I think looking to a sort of wartime created weapon really like removes the agency that we have and that's a problem I find in the AI conversation quite a lot generally is this sense that AI is the thing that's happening to us and we are sort of passive passengers in the back of the back of the car whereas whereas actually what history shows and what show in the book is that we are very important players in guiding how technology develops my sense is and I'm curious if you agree with this my sense is that there's a certain level of techn narcissism where every inventor of a technology wants to wants to convince you it's the single point of Savior for Humanity or the singular point of extermination of humanity that my is just so important what I've invented here is so incredible that either going to save or destroy the world and and the reality is it's probably somewhere in between right I just don't doesn't it feel a little bit like this all this catastrophism is a bit narcissistic yes definitely I think everyone wants to be Oppenheimer right and the movie probably didn't help it's like such an obvious observation I never thought of that anyway go ahead yeah it it makes you sort of one of the central characters in the history of our entire species if you you know do something on that level that sort of changes for good what Society is and and how we operate and you see that know the examples that I choose in the book to look at the history of science I look at everything after the atomic bomb because it was this singular moment that sort of changes science and changes how people see science and unfortunately some I people I think have taken slightly the wrong message from that story and they want to actually create something so I completely agree with you it strikes it it typically new technologies either create a new batch of um a new batch of powerful companies or it goes to the incumbents this feels like so far it's going to the incumbents even open AI feels sort of a proxy for Microsoft do you see there's there's been just an explosion and market capitalization and value here that's inspired by Ai and so far I guess you could argue Nvidia is sort of a new player but so far it feels like it's going to the incumbents do you think it's going to play out with there'll be more kind of longtail value creation or do you see that this will you know this reflects a trend towards kind of the the rich get richer if you will yeah well the sort of one of the main arguments I make in the book is that Science and Tech is as shaped by the sort of politics and culture of the time as the politics and culture of time is shaped by the Science and Tech that actually technology is incredibly political and um sort of reflects in a way the sort of existing Zeitgeist and you see this throughout history and I think it's no coincidence than that if you think about what type of society are we living in now you know vastly unequal extremely polarized uh a huge lack of trust in our institutions and our leaders and I think that's therefore playing out and you're seeing you look at just San Francisco itself and the kind of cont between the riches and the poverty there and I think that sort of plays out in the industry there's groups of us that have been doing work on AI and ethics and responsible Ai and how are we going to manage AI as Society for years and then as soon as it kind of reaches the main stream it just splits immediately along us partisan lines and either you think AI is woke you know or you think is racist and there sort of no where in between so I don't think that it's a surprise that we're seeing those sort of existing entrenched divides replicated in Ai and I don't think we have a lot of Hope for them just naturally resolving themselves I think if we want them to resolve ourselves if we decide that they want that we need them to that they can and we can do that but it sort of needs to be a choice that we take rather than something that will happen naturally I think but you in your seat you must see a decent amount of deal flow or what people are most excited about were capital and human capital and I Q is going in terms of the the the Gold Rush of financial and human capital into AI which rivers or branches does it go into does it go into media does it go into Health Care is it being used to try and figure out I don't know weapons deployment or where do you see I mean a lot of these things are self-fulfilling prophecies right if everybody focuses on AI to to you know make commercial real estate more productive Ive in office layouts more more easy easy to build then AI will be great at it where where are people pointing the AI Canon right now well it's interesting isn't it because I don't I mean I'm curious what you think Scott but the the actual deployment in real terms in a way that is you know affecting the profits affecting the bottom line of com non-te companies you know companies benefit fitting from AI products already doesn't seem to be happening and I'm starting I kind of felt this when when chat GPT blew everything up you know just over a year ago we went into this new like massive hype cycle and you couldn't move for people saying that AI was going to change absolutely everything and my instinct seeing how hard it really is to actually integrate AI into stuff I mean not least cuz some of these big businesses and certainly governments you know not even really well equipped for digital just basic digitization and digital transformation let alone of layering AI into that and I think that has born out you know 18 months or however long later that you're not really seeing it going into integrating quickly into existing business models so what I've seen is huge use of chat Bots for customer service but not in a way that is like really evident that it's working we had you probably saw the issues with dpd the parcel delivery service few weeks ago where they've replaced some you know they they Ed some new llm and it immediately starts saying horrific things about the company and swearing and all sorts of stuff so you know we s seeing people pull back from that but there is promise I think if they can operationalize things like you know the use of AI in medical imagery for example but where I see it going at the moment is a lot of people slightly flailing feeling like we should be able to use this for productivity we should be able to use it for effic for efficiencies we should be a to use it somewhere in our business and we must immediately integrate it everywhere but they're not quite sure where to go or what to do next um I think you know we're seeing a lot of push back in the media um in the media industry I should say rather than the media writing about it uh we've seen this Hollywood strikes of course and I think that shows where some of the kind of easy gains might be made but not necessarily the best for the long term and you you're right that the National Security establishment and Tech leaders think we're in an AI arms race and this that that is a problematic narrative say more yeah I think it all feeds into the same thing we're talking about if you sort of agree and accept that AI is the revolution of our time and it's happening rapidly then it's quite easy to be convinced that a is a battle to be won that's not how I think we should see ai ai is an exciting new science and technology that we should see as a potential to sort of uplift Humanity not something that becomes this very nationalistic militaristic focus and instead that's exactly what's happened I mean if AI is in the conversation of geopolitics at all it's as an arms race usually between the US and China and one of them has to win and I think that's you know I think that's bad for business because we're seeing these sort of semiconductor export bands that people are having to navigate around that I'm not sure how effective they're going to be anyway um I think it's bad for dialogue and diplomacy and cooperation collaboration conversation which we know is critically important to sort of safe management of the globe and I think it's bad for sort of us as consumers because if we continue to sort of whip into a frenzy about an AI arms race then you're going to see AI directed into more militaristic routes um or you're going to see sort of the lack of free flow of ideas just make less progress and you know leave us with less good sort of products and services um so yeah i' i' I've set up this thing called the AI and geopolitics project at Cambridge which is about trying to find alternative narratives when we talk about Ai and geopolitics that are rooted more in collaboration rather than Co sort of competition just to say that's not to be naive National Security is really important they to work in National Security you know economic competitiveness as a nation you know your our growth as a country or you know as as different countries thinking about their economic growth is critically important but what I show in the book by using this example this analogy with the space race is that there's sort of no need to do that in a way U or or there's a way to do that while also encouraging sort of inspiring exciting science and cooperation and collaboration between nations which I think is really just the only way forward it's really interesting I love your view on this and the Space Race first off I mean it's weird we don't have a food race we don't have a media race well I'll put forward with you so you tell me it feels very broy in testosterone field to me the tech is largely the domain of of the people influencing it running it and making decisions are mostly men and they immediately position it as this is a race and they become very nationalist like you can't sell chips to China this is this technology is so powerful we have a national interest in beating everybody as as opposed to saying okay this is a marvelous Innovation and it's going to it's going to help the world it immediately turns very like there's just win lose and we like to your point we go militaristic and I wonder if it's a function of tech is still mostly invested by run by and controlled by uh men who tend to be young and tend to be just quite frankly more into the Macho yeah I mean it's you know it's this thread on everything we've spoken about isn't there there like crazy hype cycle around Revolution re AI you know AI scientists has new modern day oppenheimer's and arms race it does all seem to be linked by this um these defining characteristics and look you know boldness and Bluster and sort of competition can all be really good things but you know they can also be not so much bad but counterproductive and I think that they are currently counterproductive I think we're going to see less progress if we keep going down this route frankly and so yeah I think there's a lot there's a lot in what you said and the example that I um talk about in the book the space race is a really interesting example of that right because you get Kennedy President Kennedy being very Macho and bold and and blustery kind of in the best way when he s of sets this moon mission it's deeply political deeply itical decision there's no need to go to the moon it's actually deeply unpopular at the time people don't want to do it it's extremely expensive and he chooses it because it's this competition with the Soviet Union we're in the midst of the Cold War and it becomes this very antagonistic thing so you know of course you see the great speeches where he says you we do this not because it's easy because it's hard and it's so inspirational but there's not true you know he's he's doing it because they're at at War and he's trying to win that war but then he becomes sort of older wiser you know go through quite a lot as an American president in the Cold War in just this the sort of those three short years chasen by the cubaan Missile Crisis where the world is on the brink of war and he completely changes and he goes to the UN and he essentially offers a joint moon mission to the Soviets you know he says space has to be this place of cooperation and there's no sovereignty there so there should be no issues you know there's no issue of national sovereignty up in space so there should be a way for us to cooperate and it's that leadership directly incl and and lots of diplomacy and hard work behind the scenes at the UN that leads to this un outter space treaty which two years before anyone steps foot on the moon determines that space is the province of all mankind that space is a place for Innovation and of benefiting all Humanity equally and it may have started in very sort of cynical nationalistic arms race terms the space race but you know we don't have nuclear weapons orbiting above us or nuclear weapons on the moon no one owns the moon we have things like the International Space Station and great great cooperation in space science sort of because of those political decisions so yeah I think you know there's definitely parallels with with AI today and the sort of people in charge and the people leading it and and what they value we'll be right back I'm curious so there's if you think about the interaction between government and Private Industry and then kind of value creation or wealth creation I've always said that there is you can't have a company worth more than hundred billion dollars unless it's a bike ride from a world-class Engineering University or a font of deep intellectual property that it all starts with universities and you can't go very far in AI without hearing about somebody who's involved with or teaching at Cambridge Cambridge does feel like it's one of the epicenters of AI and that's the good news the bad news is after living in London for two years I'm fairly confident they're not going to make any money there's something about UK culture where it produces the IP and the IQ but it doesn't find the Benjamins or the pounds or whatever the the slang is for currency that the IP might come out of Cambridge but someone in the US is going to monetize it and I can't figure out why well one do you agree with this but the UK seems to be especially poor in monetizing the intellectual property and Incredibly deep education and IQ that they possess yeah no I mean I do I do agree I think you know people in the UK know it and there are different diagnoses of why it happens and different like suggested remedies I was really struck by it when I was researching the early internet for the sort of final um case study with the book which is looking at the early internet and how that developed and packet switching technology was was sort of invented currently by Donald Davies in the UK as it as it was um in the US and there was sort of all the potential there given the kind of incredibly Rich Computing history churing being the the main example and the work that he was doing in the in the 50s that was sort of all the potential intellectually there that the sort of the UK would invent the internet but of course it's arpa and it's and it's the US and and as a result again as a result of some very conscious political decisions the TCP IP protocol and the way that we have the the open inet today is is sort of built on the on the US model but we you know we do struggle with that and some some of the issues just the sort of money and the investment is just not on the same scale and these things take an extraordinary amount um to to do that but you know realistically are we going to be able to compete with the US China India and given the vast resources it takes probably not so then I think we have to look at what our unique role can be as the UK and you advise people at the highest level around policy how what do you think the government's approach should be to AI do you think it needs we need to get out ahead of it how do you feel about the Biden administrations AI whatever they call it AI task force AI mandate you know supposedly there's some rules out there not entirely sure what they are but what are your thoughts around what what are you advising different governments around policy in AI so what I'm saying to people is that look AI is new but invention is not new you know progress is not new let's look at how we've done this well before and try and learn from that that is essentially what the book is about um so I think there's a few different ways to do that one is try and depoliticize it as much as possible if it gets brought into the and by that mean sort of Party politics obviously is deeply political as a subject but if it gets drawn more and more into Party politics then we're not going to get to a good outcome um I think diverse participation sort of diverse viewpoints is absolutely critical to like public trust and um also to get to a good um outcome so the second example I used in the book is the regulation of IVF which has lot IVF and human embryology research early biotech has a lot of of similarities with AI today in terms of people freaking out about what it means to be human and these deep Phil philosophical questions but the UK very successfully regulates it and has the sort of gold standard for regulation in this area globally because they set up a very diverse Comm Commission of yes biologists but also legal Scholars religious Scholars social workers philosophers to sort of look at these deep issues um and then I also I think um in addition to sort of participation and and trust and people seeing that the government is acting um I think we have to think about you know where limits do need to be set you know I think if we want to encourage trust in Ai and if we want AI to really succeed in in bringing us sort of riches and plenty and prosperity in the future then I think people do need to see that governments are willing and able to act against the kind of worst excesses and the worst Harms um rather than because of often this arms race narrative feeling like they can't touch it they can't regulate anything less they sort of fall behind in the global race so let's talk about something really important and that is London versus New York as a a larger metaphor for comparing the UK versus the United States do you have any observations I I still I'm in living in London now for almost two years and I spent a lot of time in the US grew up here and I'm still having trouble wrapping I have some observations you know some the the easy ones around the weather and all that kind of fun stuff and Premier League football is hands down the best sporting event in the world so I have the easy stuff do you have any observations around the business environments or the cultures contrast how what strikes you is the different Zeitgeist between um the two cultures oh yeah I mean you're going to have to shut me up on this CU like this is one of my favorite subjects having spent my career working between the two uh the ways in which they're so different are so interesting to me why why did you move out of interest to to to the UK uh the the the obvious questions are the ones you can't answer um it made it made no sense um around um my partner mother my children I get to pick movies and Investments she gets to decide everything else so let's be clear I'm an influencer not a decision maker and we have this practice this is probably more than you want we have this practice for every couple years we sit down and say everything's on the table what could we do or what could I do for you that would be a step change increase in your joy and your happiness like ignore all boundaries what could we do and seven years ago she said in five years I want to move to Europe and she said it very I'm convinced this was strategic because she knows if she puts a fiveyear handle on it I'll agree to anything cuz I have no sense of space and time and if someone says we'll do this in 5 years it's like saying we're not going to do it so I agreed and then 2 and a half years ago she she went to London and bought a house and unrolled our kids in school and now I'm on planes all the time coming to the US and going to Premier League games but the the less snarky answer is we move there because we can and we didn't people always say oh you move there because you don't like America or you move there because of America I'm like yeah I did move there because of America but I moved there because I've recognized such incredible opportunity and prosperity in America that I get to take my family abroad for a couple years so why did we move there we move there because we can and we wanted to take advantage of a worldclass city in the proximity of the continent but there was no like what I'd call overriding Strategic imperative here I still don't have a good answer for why we moved to London other than we could and we thought it would be good for the kids anyways that's my TED talk it's I it's interesting because quite a lot of Americans have moved recently I think it's been more you know it's the highest on record number of of Americans moving to the UK sort specifically and um I studied in the US I love the US I think it stands for so many incredible things I love visiting um sort of grew up wanting to probably move there at some point but actually the older I've got I'm such a huge fan of London and of the UK um and of Europe and I I find the the US culture is not something I could like live in full fulltime why is there pause there why what is it about us culture that that doesn't doesn't appeal to you there's a few things so one I think the centrality of business and money is too much like I think it's important in London but it's not the most important thing to everyone um all the time if you go to Silicon Valley it's all that's talked about all the time it often is quite direct as you'll know but sometimes it's even just like these indirect proxies for just oh we're still just talking about money here really I find that very you know just distasteful honestly it just it just doesn't interest me um that much so um in California specifically I think the kind of vast inequality is just too difficult to to sort of um cope with and it's been getting worse this is sort of you know the introduction of my book um I started it that way really as an excuse to start with a picture of George Harrison because I'm a big Beatles fan but um I was also making a serious Point here the solution from with San Francisco my disillusion with San Francisco um it's just getting worse and most over years so yeah I find that obsession with money and and business like very very difficult and I think you know American politics and um the the divisiveness is very difficult I think we're really lucky in the UK we have the BBC and a very well regulated media environment um I I'm sure I could get a lot of push back on the idea that it's very well regulated but compared to the US um it is very well regulated I think and I think we have to guard that with everything that we have in in the UK but it means in the UK there's still a sort of shared sense of Truth which is important for a sort of functioning Society I think and I think in the US there's um it's less and less clear to me that there is sort of an accepted shared sense of Truth or or or sort of community um in that way so I I could go on but I don't want to keep being mean to a country I do love and think it's really important but I could never ever live here it's really interesting yeah it's um yeah so obviously you've never been to In-N-Out burger or you would consider moving to California just Scot we have Shake Shack in London now so the only reason left to move to the US is is gone trust me and in and out is not as good as Shake Shack me and my boys know about Shake Shack in the UK a US company by the way and does not hold a candle to in- and- Out Burger I will I will accept that we are culturally uh somewhat inferior and obsessed with money but no In-N-Out Burger is is is is the key not inferior Scott it's just not my taste you tricked me there to getting on to my favorite subject which is trying to feel you know a sense of superiority about the UK yeah very patriotic yeah it's it's um it's really and glad we hooked you in with the football though that's oh it's incredible it's absolutely incredible that's what I'll I think that's what I'll remember most um about the UK experiences it Premier Le games with um my boys um so just as we wrap up here if you're trying to coach a young person around how given the emergence of these new technologies in AI such that they're AI literate such that they're AI competent such that they can use this as a weapon as they go into the work world where do you tell them to start is it taking classes is it just using these platforms is what coach coach your 22-year-old self on how to ensure that they don't get left behind and they're not obsolete at 30 or 35 well I try not to freak people out by putting that on the table as an option and um I find that kind of easy because I don't believe that if you're not an ai ai expert that you're going to be obsolete I think that's for a few reasons but the primary one is because I think that other disciplines are just as as critical to the sort of development and integration of AI as the AI subjects themselves I mean what I I absolutely love Science and Tech and it's why I spent a most of my life working in it but I think a a cultural problem that we have given ourselves by putting Tech on a pedestal is we've undervalued Humanities degrees we've undervalued other skills that people have if you don't you know if you're not a engineer or a physicist mathematician software engineer you know then then then you're sort of not worthy in this new economy and I just I just don't think that's true but my main advice is like pick the thing you're passionate about I think trying to force yourself if you're not a technology uh expert to become one is not really going to be the thing that benefits you and gives you sort of a FL flourishing fulfilling career that mean that's not what I did right I chose the things that I was passionate about history and then politics and through politics I actually discovered by working on Tech issues National Security issues inside government I found my way to into technology so that is truth me advice however I do think I think it's a great Advantage if you can understand how the tech works that doesn't mean you have to like take a full course or you have to make it part of your degree I think you know reading about it is important it's partly why I wrote the book and I think having more people with different kind of perspectives and inputs and viewpoints is is going to be actually the thing that gets us there in in the long term Verity Harding is a globally recognized expert in AI technology and public policy she currently serves as the Director of the AI and geopolitics project at Cambridge University's Bennett Institute for public policy and is the founder of formation advisory a technology consultancy firm Verity's debut book AI needs you how we can change ai's future and save our own is out now she joins us from the cultural Wasteland known as New York city so uh very the way I would describe the difference my distillation of the US and the UK is that the US is the best place to make money and Europe is the best place to spend it what do you think that's pretty fair pretty fair pretty fair it's a fair fair summary yeah I probably should have done that probably should have done that not too late something tells me you're in a pretty hot area I you are literally the most employable person I've ever met anyways thanks for your time D thank you Scott thanks for having me I enjoyed [Music] it
