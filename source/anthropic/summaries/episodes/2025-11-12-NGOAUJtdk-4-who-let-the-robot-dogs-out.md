# Who let the robot dogs out

This episode does not specify a guest but focuses on the practical applications of AI in robotics.

## Core Thesis
Frontier AI models, specifically Claude, are advancing the field of robotics by assisting teams with limited technical expertise to accomplish sophisticated tasks more efficiently. Through Project Fetch, these AI models are shown to significantly reduce the time required for task completion, highlighting the potential for AI to eventually handle tasks independently.

## Key Insights
- Frontier AI models transform software engineering in robotics, making it accessible for those with limited experience.
- Project Fetch demonstrates that teams with access to Claude completed complex tasks much faster than those without.
- The future may see AI models undertaking tasks independently, minimizing the need for human intervention.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Leverage AI tools like Claude to streamline technical operations and enhance efficiency, especially in environments less familiar with robotics.
2. Encourage the integration and training of AI technologies to empower less-experienced teams to participate in and contribute to complex projects.

## Notable Quotes
> "Project Fetch is this self-contained experiment where we wanted to measure how much does Claude accelerate humans performing a fairly sophisticated technical task that they do not have experience with?"

> "The results of the experiment were essentially that the team with Claude completed all of the things that they did complete in a couple of hours faster than the team without Claude."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
- **Business Application:** Integrating AI like Claude in project management workflows could help the Wilde Agency improve turnaround times and expand into more technically demanding domains with existing personnel, thus enhancing overall operational capacity.
