# Get customers without PhD marketing

Published: 2025-07-27

In this video, I'm going to show you a way to create a marketing machine literally for your product without creative work, without guesswork, just by following a chain of prompts designed to extract the core features and understanding of your product. From there, finding out what's the underlying problem of your customer. Not the one you think they have, but the one they probably really have, but it is hard to to see at first. Take all of that and transform it in a deep research prompt that is made for AI agents to do the work for you, to do the customer research for you. Then we will run this prompt in the all the major AI agents that do that do market research for us right now which I will go deeper in the video and we will combine this market research into a mega market research report that we will process to first the right marketing angles and from there create killer content literally content that speaks exactly to your customers in their own words. So, this video is aimed at people that already have a product or at least an idea that is um well built. It's not a video for people to that are looking for an idea. But if you have a product, then watch until the end because it might be long. I don't know yet. uh but we will go through um technical steps like I will take a product and bring it through the whole system so you can see the chain of prompt and what we are are going to extract from the understanding and the market research that we will do with AI agents. So, it might be long, but at the end of this video, you will have a way, a method to just do the equivalent of what a very good marketing agency would have done actually because now it's not doing the work of an average marketer. It's doing an amazing job in marketing. And it's not like is AI good at marketing or not. It's all about context and about the prompt context and how do you frame and and sequence this information. This framework I've spent the past couple of weeks to cook it to test it and refine it. Um and I'm confident that it could help every founder that is struggling um to market their product. I think traditional market re market market research is dead and I figured that out the first time I tried an AI agent to do my market research. I started with this one um when it came out and I have just done a complete market research report with the the state-of-the-art market research system for a client. I run it through uh I run the same thing through OpenAI deep research and I got a result that was similar at worst but probably better than what I did and this day I thought okay the way we do market research and customer research is is changed now forever. So we need to understand how is it done now and that's why I was kind of obsessed with this new framework that I'm sharing today. um because I really think it's a game changer for every founder out there. All right, so let's pick a product and start from there. Um I was thinking of taking a product that I have already went through during my test, but I thought it was um it would be funnier to take a product um that I haven't looked at before or at least I haven't um do the the the full system with it. Uh, so I went to this Reddit thread um 10 days ago. Drop drop your product. I roast it. You roast mine. I looked into the different tools just I wanted to find an example that might be interesting because it contains different angles that we can reach out to the customer from this one daily post AI which uh is daily checkins but align align your team in minutes. So basically for remote work um teams to especially for manager probably but that needs to kind of to to not lose touch with the their team if I understand properly. I I didn't check it for for too long. So I might not be completely aware but we will find out. Uh this is an indie founder I guess. I mean there is no traffic so I guess the product is new probably no customer maybe a few uh we don't know but it doesn't matter what's interesting is to see what we have now and what we could do with it so what we have now is something very technical it's like daily checkins so so that's the stuff it does okay fine that's that's a clear headline but it's still like very u ve very feature oriented log mood plans and hours AI turn them into actionable insight in one streamline feed. So the good thing about it is that it is clear. It tells exactly what it does. What I think is missing a little bit is that it doesn't talk to the real problem and I hope that this is what we are going to find out uh by using the system. So just before we start uh let me walk you through quickly what we are going to look at. The first thing is to understand the product and here as uh you can read it's understand the product from first principle thinking. So it's not to I mean I think it's pretty cool to talk about first principle in general. uh but it is very important to that the AI understand what the product does without the framing of the founder doing the the marketing at first it's like okay what does it do exactly without talking about who is it for but what does the product do so that's the basis for the AI to work and once we have the the the explanation of the product then we first ask AI to think of different ideal customers. So at this point there is no customer research that have been done but we there is a prompt that is engineered to um to kind of what I explained in the beginning it's not about find the obvious problem uh it's about the underlying problem like who is the potential person that is going to use the product and what are they really trying to solve what is the job to be done by the product so it solve this underlying pain that they have once we have the persona then we transform it in uh customer research because you can't make a customer research with AI agents for all the persons at once. Every potential ideal customer has a certain set of problems that they need to solve and it doesn't make any sense to make a research for all of them because it will be completely confusing and and AI can't work with that. You have to say okay I want to look into this kind of people and to find out what are they really struggling with. Once we have that then we want to understand the marketing angles. An angle is how do you tackle the problem basically uh how do you address it in your message so it it talks to the person or not so several person with the same problem will react to different message I know it's a little bit theoretic a little bit theoretical right now but we will go into more practical thing and once we have that then we have our basis we understand the products we choose one persona We have done a market research uh customer research then we decide to go for a specific angle. Let's say this one and then with this one we can create the content. So that's what we are going to do with the framework. All right. So let's start the framework. Now by the way there is a notion template uh with the prompts. Uh you will find the link in the description. Um, and I wanted to point out what are the AI you can use to run this prompt. Basically, when it comes to marketing, keep in mind that code is the way to go. At least for now. Um, I play with all of them, but when it comes to writing marketing copies, there is nothing better than cloud. It's like uh open AI models are like researchers guys and cloud is more like it's it's someone that is connected to people. I don't know if that's how I see them but I always use a cloud for marketing. So if you have only one that you have access to then it's better to have cloud although you can run it the whole process with one of the three major elements out there. um open if you have a paid account first year um pro plan $20 per month with open AAI cloud or Germany it works uh but I will I recommend cloud and we will talk about the access to the different AI agents later but you can start with cloud and that's what we are going to do right now so let's start by understanding the product that we picked uh from first principal thinking so I just picked the URL just hopefully the founder didn't block the the um scrolling from AI and I'm grabbing the prompt here. So I'm just copying the full prompt. So it's on notion so it copies it in markdown which is very important. So the outcome of this prompt is to answer these questions. What is the product? What does it do? What problem does it solve? What secondary jobs or use cases might it help with? What is the current positioning? The ones the one the founder thought about and who is the customer versus the user because it's an important question because in some products u the pe person using it is not going to be the person buying it. So that's just in case and then we have to put the URL of the product. So I just copied the the prompt. I come in cloud and I press Ctrl cap V enter and now I'm copying the URL here and just make sure that I am on extended syncing that's why um I like to use cloth because you also can switch from extended syncing to not uh with open AI 03 would work at this uh stage um but yeah let's go for for This one I'm using sonet 4 instead of opus4. Um I would prefer to use opus4 but it's really annoying and blocked very fast with with opus. So son does a very good job so I just do it with it. All right let's run it. What do we have? Uh daily pulse. I'm really sorry I it's a it's a pain. I'm it's a shame I'm doing videos where I read a lot. Even though I have a lot of struggle reading in English but I always uh try my best. So if you want you can just pause and and read yourself but uh otherwise I will do it. Uh Daily Pulse is a digital platform where remote teams uh team members submit daily checking containing their mood plan and brokers. Okay, understood that. So you read it fine. What does it do? Uh team members complete daily check in sum reporting mode daily plans and blockers. AI summarize uh individual check in and identify patterns and display all team activities. Okay. Generate daily projects. Okay. Tracks time u process time of requests. Okay. Organized team. Okay. So you really got like all the features. What problem does it solve? Delip address the challenge of maintaining team alignment and leadership visibility in remote work environment. Fair enough. without requiring time to requiring time consuming video calls or meeting. It eliminates the friction of gathering daily status updates and blocker from distributed team members while giving leaders real time insight into team progress and potential issues. All right, got it. What secondary job uh repress or supplement traditional daily standup? Yes, it provides data uh for performance reviews uh create documentation support HR. Okay. What's the current positioning? Positioning is just like okay, this is what it does. Who is the customer? Team leaders, managers or HR decision maker who need visibility into remote team. Okay. The user, the individual team member will complete the date checkin plus the manager leader who review the day checking. But see that's in this case um the person buying is not the person using although in this case the person using doesn't really have a say into the the choice of buying or not the product uh at first but then it will become the decision maker because if you buy this product and they don't like it then um it won't last but anyway that's not what we are looking at we are looking at who is the decision maker in buying the product and by the way the framework work works for B2C or B2B. In this case, it's B2B, but it's it's exactly the same. It's just a it's a H2O H. It's human to human basically that we want to do. Uh relationship. Okay. Question for clarification. So, if you want if the AI didn't go far enough and or didn't understand, then it will al also ask questions. So, if you are running the system, you can just answer the question to help help AI to understand it better. All right. So now we have the the product. We know exactly what it does, what problem it solve. Cool. We need to understand now the real problem behind it. Not the one we thought was the problem, but the real problem. So let me grab the second prompt, the deep problem analysis and ideal customer discovery. And I simply have to copy and then paste it here and run it. The real problem this product solves surface problem remote team need daily alignment and leader need visibility into team stages. Exactly what we have read just before. Underlying Pin remote work creates information asymmetry where manager lose traditional signal of productivity, engagement and team health while team member lack structured ways to communicate blockers before they become quizzes. Okay, so this is more linked to remote uh work specifically. Now the meta problem management anxiety and organizational confidence crisis in remote work. Leaders fear they are losing control and effectiveness in distributed environment while organization worry that remote work means less accountability, slower problem resolution and invisible dysfunction. People pay for this to regain confidence, control, and professional security in an uncertain work model. That's the the thing that is important to regain confidence and control and they fear they fear not to be uh to to be what to do what we expect from them, the leaders. So I I hope that you see the the difference between okay this is what the product does and it yes it is addressed to leaders in remote work but actually why would they buy it is because they want to solve the pain of not knowing not feeling in charge not uh accomplishing their job properly. So now we are looking at the difference uh potential customer profile and at this point we still haven't had a customer research done right this is just based on what AI understands from the product. So we have the ideal customer one the anxious middle manager what they really want professional security through demonstrated competence and control over the remark team performance. Core motivation fear-based fear of being blindsided by team problems. Fear of looking incompetent to superior. Fear that remote team members aren't actually productive. fear of carrier damage from team failures they couldn't prevent. That's that's the thing we are going to to go after probably not all all in but probably why would they pay to sleep better at night knowing they have early warning system to have data to prove they are effectively managing their team. So it's not really managing the team. They will pay for that. They will justify it by yeah we will increase the productivity but actually they will make the decision of buying it to feel better themsel and to be able to prove yeah but I put the system in place and now it's you have the proof. Not going to go through the other ones. Um you can if you want to pause uh but for the sake of the video not being two hours we will just go with the frost. And now we are going to create the prompts. So for in this conversation with code we are going to ask code now to create the prompt that we will take and run into every different AI agent. So let me grab the next prompt. Craft a deeper search prompt. Nothing special to do. just copy it and oh yeah there is some something special to do here. Yeah. Yeah. For this one, uh just say, uh let's go for let's go for this one and copy the prompt again and give it to. Now we wait and we will just take this prompt and put it in the AI agent. So while it's crafting the prompt, let me uh walk you through the next step. We have all those agents. It could be done, let's say you have only uh a paid plan with cloud, you could do it only with cloud research. It is here in a different window uh in different conversation. But if you have different accounts like I have, I have a paid plan for cloud for OpenAI and for uh Germany. Very important. I mean the value we get out of it is like that there it's a no-brainer anyway. Um $60 for $60 for that. It's okay. I also have broke actually. Uh and you also have menus which is an AI agent. Let me open that. So my point is there they are different they have different way of researching different platform they would check. For example, CL I think is not going on Reddit, which is kind of an important one, but it is going deep on like niche forums and they all have their own way. Um, obviously I have my favorite ones. I think Cloud and OpenAI are the best ones so far, but all of them deserve to be in. But if you have only one, then it's it's totally okay. It's it works. And honestly, I mean, you have to have at least a paid plan to run the framework. So, if you do it, you have at least one deep research available. Uh, but you also have free generous free plan on Gen Spark and Manus AI that could do the job for you. And I even think that you can run deeproarch for free uh in uh with OpenAI. Anyway, let's look at the prompt and then we will uh past it in different uh agent that I just opened. So it gives you give it to you in uh in a markdown block which is exactly what you want. Uh and I just have to copy it and I opened a new window within code. Just copy the prompt research sonet 4. It's fine. And then I started cloud is going to start right away. Not asking me questions. And it's the longest of all of them. With OpenAI, I do the same, but then this time I say deep research, and it's going to ask me a few questions, which is fine. It's just um Oh, what's that? Uh, are there specific platform you'd like me to prioritize? Um um everything relevant. I don't want to bother. Are you interested in quotes in English? English three. Should I focus in particular industry? Um, no. Just remote work. Okay, it doesn't really matter. Then we have Germany. Germany. Same thing. I'm passing the prompt. Then deep research. And I think it doesn't ask any question. It should start right away. Not my favorite for deep research though. Then we also have Grock which is um really interesting too fast and interesting. So I click deep research. Unfortunately I don't have Gro 4 yet. I really want to test it out but I didn't get the plan yet but it works with group three. Then we have manus and here I just do the exact same thing. Mostly I'm it's just to show you that there are it's not only openai include you can do it in different platforms. Uh, and then we have Jen Spark. Same thing. And I can say I think deep research or something here. Oh, no. No. Let's just go with that. Let's just make sure it is not asking question. And so I'm not going to be blocked. So menu started working. Gro is working fine. Uh, yeah. Jiminy asked me to just confirm that I want to start the research. Yes, I do. Um, Chad GPT is working and code is working and gen spark started as well. That's really cool because now it's just about waiting. It's about 20 minutes and it's perfect because now I'm going to have lunch and I see you uh after that so we can look at the different result we had. All right. So, I'm back from lunch. Um, and while I was eating, I got like the notification. Okay, your report is ready. Your report is ready. I just checked it out and they are all done. So, now we are going to look at them. I will try not to spend too much time on each of them otherwise it will be endless. But what's really interesting to see is the sources um to understand which one is using what and how they are thinking of research. And the funny thing is, I mean, I literally went to have a nice quiet time while I had six AI agents like scavenging the internet for me. So just we will go through it and just imagine the time that you would have needed to do it yourself to get the same result. It's it's just insane. So the first of all is claude which uh generally is the longest as I said and it gathered 240 sources. So you can open the sources and you can see how it kind of thinks. So it looks at articles and from what I understand it looks at article that gives it different branches to go into. It looks at uh comparison between tools. So then he finds tools that he can actually go and look at the competitor reviews which is a very cool thing that the others are not all doing. So, Capter then now certain specific tools tools again um tools again product and um interesting in Amazon reviews uh other articles and comparisons um here it's like I don't know it's kind of uh probably some forums or something not sure it says Reddit but it doesn't look into Reddit and that's what I said Claude is looking everywhere but not on at least uh not a lot. Facebook um is looking into it. Interesting. YouTube. Oh no, that's not YouTube. YouTube current. Yeah, it's referring to YouTube. Ning. Well, that's that's a lot. That's really coring research and the result is looking like that. So, we have a description. Uh we have all the sources. Uh professional identity crisis. Uh the transition to remote man remote management has shaken many managers sense of or professional identity forcing them to question their value and competence. So that's related to what we are seeing. And then it's going to uh quote so I I haven't read it. So let's see what it says. And I'm just moving on the next one. Being so that's someone posting somewhere right? uh being a manager is isolating enough since the buck stops stops you. Sorry, I don't know what's the buck when it comes to mentorship results and team performance. So, working in a silo at home or even from a beachfront balcony gets super lonely as well. I have experienced in this anxiety several time through my remote work kaya and this is it something that I have had uh to be deliberate about nipping in the bud still don't know what it means anyway I think this one is interesting because it's another point of view it's not exactly the problem of like legitimacy and you know what we were talking about earlier but it's another point of view which when you add them up all then it starts creating like the complete picture of who is the actual target audience because this is definitely cloud found the target audience right uh trust and control anxiety professional identity cris we said it uh isolation and overwhelm technology and frustrations so for each um pain points we have a quick definition and we have quotes and we have the context uh so the AI when we will process that knows exactly what we are talking about for each quote. All right, so that's cloud and you can see already that it has a bunch of really good insight. So basically if you go only with cloud it works as well but if you have the other ones it's even better. Now let's look at um chit and this is how it looks like. Uh start here same thing. So we have painpoint and then we have quotes uh trust and control anx management. Uh the biggest challenge has always been trust. Me trusting my team they can get the work done and them trusting me to let them know when they are droning uh or need help to to let to let me know. Sorry. Uh this is why so many company don't do remote anymore because the lack of trust in the team. That one is really good. That one is really powerful because it's it's exactly what we were talking about earlier. So now looking u at I mean I can we can you can look at the full report um slower but for the sake of the video we are going to move on. Uh interesting thing here you can see that um it just went on Reddit. So we have cloud that went through like more than 200 sources no Reddit and you have OpenAI that I mean OpenAI has a deal with Reddit so they are direct access and they can just dig into it and find interesting insight. That's why it's good to have at least two agents that are doing it school. Now we have um the report from Germany. First look at the sources here. It's kind of a mix, but there is definitely less sources than um than code, but you can see there is a mix of Reddit and different articles that led it different ways. As I said at the beginning, I'm not a huge fan of Germany because the way it creates the reports is never amazing. Uh let me reopen it. But let's look at it anyway. So, it's kind of a mix of OpenAI and and and code. Oh yeah, this time sometime last time he gave me a um it looked like a research paper with an abstract and which is not what I wanted but this one this time he followed the instruction. So we have the the overview painoint overview and then we have uh the different quotes. So my dad runs an SS SAS company with a remote dev team and one of his biggest struggle is staying updated on what's actually getting done through the week. So when they finally meet at the end of the week, they realize all the things that went wrong, issues that could have been caught and fixed earlier. This caused lots of delay, mis misalignment, and frustration. The problem isn't the work itself, but the lack of visibility between meetings. It's harder to manage staff who are not in plain sight. I don't know if you see that. Um, but going back to code Let me just find something interesting. And that's the reason why again I'm not a huge fan of deep research with Germany. What you see here is if you remember it's the surface problem. It's not really good at really digging into the human real struggles. If you look at it that's the surface problem. go back to code and just that um question that comes to mind when it comes to managing people remotely. How do I continue to do well? How do I create proximity in the absence of physical presence? How can I ensure high motivation, performance and productivity? So that is like really someone questioning himself, right? The pitfall will be pushing your weight around. Sometimes as a remote team lead, you find yourself easily agitated and irrades with the smallest mistakes and that's because you have a lot less relationship and good emotions to build on due to the fact that you guys don't really see each other. So the difference is like here we have a human an actual remote uh team manager that is talking about deeper struggle and here is okay this cause a lot of delays misalignment and frustration. Yeah we know that that's productivity that's deep deep problem. So let's go quickly to the other ones. Uh, we have Grock that is he heavily on Reddit mostly and that was the very first one to finish. Like I didn't even go for lunch yet and it was already done. So it's a little bit less complete. Um, but it's it's fine. I mean if you only have that it's uh it's better than nothing uh for the No, it's not here. It's this one. Sorry. Yeah, for the time that you spend it's it's it's good. I mean you have actual quotes from Reddit. You have everything you need. Oh, we know this one. We have seen it. So that's we are going to the next step which will be uh reducing the overlapping and only keeping um one version of each but obviously they're all searching the same sources. So some are overlapping at this point. Um yeah, so it's a complete report. Um still not as good as code and and OpenAI, but good. Then we have menus. uh I couldn't really find out the sources but looking at what it was looking into uh it was there are some there is some Reddit there is some articles um Mckenz goes into Reddit as well so it's kind of a mix and the report is good but it's not really competing compared to what we have seen already and then we have genark uh let me it's here starts here uh fear of losing control and visibility. Okay. However, I'm struggling to manage my 100% framework team. I've been in this role for over a year. I've never met any of my team in person and I feel disconnected from them. Uh it's hard to judge uh what people are working on, what they are doing with or overworked. I felt like my personality and what made me a good leader is extremely blunted over chat, video, and video call. And that's that's a very interesting insight as well. Uh I mean I don't know if the product would solve that but um that's interesting. Anyway, I'm not going through anything everything but uh you can see it's a it's a fair um uh it's a fair report. What do we have as sources? We have a lot of Reddits and some forums. Ask a manager forum, Harvard Business Review and other professional management account communities between 2022 and 2024. Yes. Because in the prompt uh it's specified to only look at the the sources from the last the past two years just to avoid like to have like a 10 year old forums because there are plenty on the internet. So going back to our step-by-step process um this is where we are. So we have run all the agents and we have gathered all the reports right. So if we look at the different prompts we have done the understanding the products. We have raised the real problems craft a prompt for deep research. We have run it and now we are going to that was an awful drawing. we are going to run the mega market research personal consolidation. So what it means I touched on it earlier it's like we have plenty of sources that have been u uh found and some are are the same um so there is some overlapping and we want to avoid that. So we want to to transform this uh different market research report into the mega market research report that we can use again and again to be the base of your marketing. Just before I want to remind you that what we are going to have is our customer research reports which is only linked to one single persona or ideal customer. It doesn't work for all of them. If you wanted to uh dig into a new type of idle customer, new persona or ICP, call it however you want, you could you have to do it again. You have to go from there and to run a new um AI agent deep research process so you can find uh insight on a different person. The one we have now is for remote uh leaders but it works only for them. Right? So that's being said, let's uh have a look at how do we transform that into a mega market research report. And obviously we have a prompt that we will use. But before we use the prompt, we need to format it. And that's a little bit of manual work, manual quote unquote. Uh we need to put all the reports together. And what's very important is that they are um sent show shown to AI uh in markdown. So markdown is uh this the struct the y structure of the information. Uh I will show you that right now. So the best way I form is to have a new notion page. So um market uh customer research reports. So I open a unison page. The cool thing is that notion always keeps the markdown formatting. So I will start by code and I get this one and here I can just copy it. Cool. So I will just so markdown is like one hashtag and then it creates a heading one. I say close and then I copy. And as you can see here, it keeps the the the different formatting that we had. Now, next one. Open AI. All right. Now we have all our reports after each other and we have a long list that we can give to AI. So let's take a look at the actual prompt here the mega market research persona consolidation. And it starts by saying okay I run the prompt with an s no with the prompt with different AI deep uh research agents and now I'm going to give you all the reports I got from them and it re iterate on the the structure be beware of the overlapping and so on so forth. So I just copy it, get go back into my former conversation which the last message was the um the prompt that I run into the the AI agent and I passed it here. And then I go in my notion page and I simply passed it here. And now it creates this file. And as you can see, you can see the structure of the markdown here. So AI will understand it better. So that's perfect. And now let's run it. So it took 12 seconds. Um but then we have now it's writing it's writing the the full report. As you can see we have one complete synthesis for the persona that we are um um digging into. And then we have the first problem that they're facing the first painoint professional identity crisis and imposter syndrome. Funny we haven't even uh looked into it. This represent the deepest deepest psychological wound manager questioning their fundamental competence and worse when traditional management signal disappear. I can't help but feel like I failed. This doesn't feel like supporting my mental health. It feels like giving up. It feels like giving up on my staff and betraying my superiors. I hate this feeling. Now we are talking about the actual meta underlying problem. We are not on the surface program and that's exactly what we want. So we start seeing all the pain points with all the quotes for this specific person or for the real problem that they have and it's it's not even uh finished to to create because it will be a very very long uh report. Now let me while it's doing that let's uh go back into the framework and see what's next. So once we have that we are not done processing and finding more um insight about that. We want the AI to go and find marketing angles. I touched on that earlier. What are they? There are ways to tackle the problem. And if for the sake of simplicity and I will add a little parenthesis for for the sake of simplicity here we are not going to create content for one single angle all the time. It's just to give AI more understanding on how it can work with the content. But again also for the sake of simplicity in this video I let on the side the competitor research which would be u interesting to do but we don't have to do it um with everything we have done so far and the results with the customer research it's plenty enough to write good copies but we just want a last little uh little more processing the data to find out the marketing angles. So we need to grab the next prompt which is find marketing angles which does exactly how it's called and we are going back to the mega market research reports that have been generated right all the quotes and simply copying this one and let it find the angles. Okay, so now it's running. Okay, there we have it. So again, if you imagine the pain points is like is the source there is a pain and the angle is like the opposite. It's like uh um is how how do you make it feel like okay this is what you will get if you have this pain point basically. So we can I'm not going to read everything but um quickly the core marketing angles u stop stop flying blind this manager will buy anything that gives them back the visibility they've lost uh they are not seeking data for data sake they want to feel competent and in control again so stop flying blind uh we have sleep sound again um this manager losing their sleep over their team they prepare for peace of mind and the confidence that they'll know about problems before they become disasters and so on and so forth and in the end strategic recommendation. So that's just clothes saying here's what you should do. Lead with stop flying blind. This angle is has the most immediate visceral appeal and addresses their most pressing daily frustration. Support with slip sound. Again use never get blindsided again for urgency. This create fear-based motivation and around carrier protection. Reserve aspirational angers for retention. Once they they're solving their immediate pain, they can focus on becoming better leaders. So that's pretty good and that will be a part of our mega prompt that we will use as the base of the marketing. All right, we are almost there. We are almost creating the killer content uh before we have one more step which is to put together all the marketing bricks. And for that there is a little tool which is not crazy but it works fine. This is the marketing brick. So we have the product description that we have done at the very beginning. We have the consolidated personal which is all the different uh reports put together. And we have the marketing angles. And here it's notion if you know a little bit notion you have like sync blocked. The idea is just to have them one after the other is just to simplify the thing. So let's grab the product description first. So we can go at the very beginning. It was the first prompt. I could have done it at the very beginning, but let's just grab that up here. Product description. Copy it here. Then let's grab the consolidated persona that was towards the end before the angles. It's here. Let's grab it. We put it here. All right. And last one, the marketing angles. It's the last one. Yeah. Okay. Done. And now we just have to open the mega context prompt which gives us the idea is just to copy that right you copy that now and I can open any new conversation with code for example. If I open a new chat and I just pass that and make it read it then from there it will understand everything we have done so far and then I can now create content just now it's analyzing everything basically. All right cool it knows what we are going to do. Let me just give you a quick overview of what it does. Again, you can do that in a text file. It doesn't matter. It's just it's a little bit more fancier, a little bit fancier in notion. You are tasked to help me with different copyrightiting tasks. No need to do a lot of instruction here. It's in the next prompt. Here's the updated context about my product. Read it and wait for the next instruction. We have the product description. So, it's the block here. We have the consolidated persona and we have the marketing angles here. and it is put uh with the right formatting so AI will understand it perfectly. And here we have a general copywriting framework um which is just um you can read it if you want but it's just added to give more insight on how to write copy basically it's just a little plus so now we again this is a brand new conversation I just passed this and this is my machine that I can use now to create u copyrightiting so I go back here and I have a few prompts but you You can imagine as many prompt as you want. So for example, uh let's go and and create um landing page program agitate solve framework. So I just grab my prompt here and I pass it here. And now it's building the landing page for me. No need for more uh explanation. I can ask it whatever I want. It knows everything about my specific persona. Okay, so we have it. Uh let's have a look at it. So it's first shot, right? No improve no improvements. Let's see what it does. So we have the headline. We have two versions that he gave flying blinds with your remote team. Question can tell what your remote team is actually doing. We have another they are pretty good, but we have also another prompt specific for headline. Sub line for managers who feel disconnected from their remote team and struggle to judge judge productivity mood and bookers without constant check-in. Uh when you can see your team working every day feels like you're one step behind the program that could deres your project. Very good one. Now prem recognition bullet. So just here um having a look at our product from the beginning it's it's good but it's purely um saying what it does right and it starts from explaining what it does to basically explaining what it does and there is no nothing about the actual problem the the customer is facing. So here you would have headline, sub headline and then a few bullet points to explain the problem and it would be these ones. Uh you are constantly wondering if is everyone is actually working or just showing up to meetings. Small issues turns turn into big problem because you find out about them week to weeks too late. You spend half of your day chasing status updates through Slack, emails and random checking calls. That's definitely from the conversations. You feel like you're failing as a manager because you can't tell when your team is struggling or falling behind. Good. Now we because we choose this framework PAS framework. Now it's agitates. So every day you can't see what's happening. You are gumbling with your reputation. It's a little bit tough but it's agitating the program. Your current approach isn't working. Daily standups it's up every times gives you surface level updates. Slack messages create chaos. um people either don't respond for hours or flood you with urgent requests that are aren't actually urgent. You can see how this copy is fed by the insight that we got into the market research and and there there are two ways to do it. either you are yourself uh a product manager u um a manager in remote team and you know exactly from A to Z all the pain points. So you can write it yourself but you also need marketing uh skills or you do the market research and then you will write it as it will write it as if it would be uh an actual manager in remote team. From there you could simply um recreate your landing page. Basically that's the whole point. Um choose whatever you want. But then you also have other ways to uh generate content. So for example uh other things that you can generate mini VSSL. So VSSL would be uh you would have here um a video explaining the problem and also the product. So for SAS businesses it's a little bit you know you you it's B2B you don't want to spend too much time into um uh into talking like the deep problem of the customer and VSSL you want to show okay this is if this is the problem you have then you should use our product basically but you can turn it the way you want let's just pass it after that and see what kind of VSSL it's giving Okay. Daily plus uh gives manager complete visibility into visibility into their remote teams through 30 secondond daily check uh checks in gets processed by AI into actionable insights. So straight to the point if you're managing a remote team you know how hard it is to judge what people are working on and whether they are struggling with anything. you're constantly chasing status updates through Slack blah blah blah the same as we had solution here's how daily policies work each time uh so now it's straight to the point so it's a mini VSSL for uh for SAS business but that takes the exact problem from the market research we have done let's have a look now at uh another one I'm trying to speed it up now you you got the the problem the the whole thing is just to show you because the video is probably already really long Um so we here for now u there are four frameworks of landing pages you create you can create uh hooks for ads if you want to do ads for example let's create hooks while I'm showing you the other ones so you can create the hooks the VSSL the landing pages viral uh Tik Tok script and then it will lead me to how I create this one because I'm not a Tik Tok expert, but I will explain you how I created this one. And that's pretty cool. That's the kind of the bonus. Let's have a look at the uh ads that we can create. The hooks that you can put on a picture to to run ads or even to make post whatever. Um so there is a manager in C Seattle who hasn't lost sleep over her remote team in six months and she's she and she manages 12 repos across four time zones. future pacing. Uh two weeks from now, you'll go to bed knowing exactly what your time team is working on tomorrow, who needs help and which problem to tackle first Monday morning. So this is a specific thing um type of hooks and uh I need to give credit for this one. I didn't share all all the the hooks possible. I just need to give credit to Sara Living. um that I found this this prompt on LinkedIn once and uh since then I really liked it. Um so yeah check check her out. Uh she has a lot of good content about customer research but this one is one of the prompts she shared on LinkedIn. There are plenty of other prompts that you can use. The most important is how is that you have the research before. Let's go back to the uh Tik Tok script. So I'm not an expert in Tik Tok. So what did I do? I just went on YouTube, looked for the best video that explains how to make viral Tik Tok script and transformed it into prompt. Here's the prompt that I used the meta prompt. Convert any educational content into AI prompt. So basically you just write this another conversation. You write this prompt and at the end you just give the transcript of the video or the blog article whatever and it will give you a prompt that you can use along with the market research report that the complete mega prompt that we created that will create the output that is explained in the video. So that's how I created this one. So now we can have a look at this one and I'm not creating a new um conversation. I think it should be fine. So now we are talking about if you are uh acquiring potential customer with short form video which is what a lot of uh SAS owners um ind developers are doing. Um then you can use that to write the script that you would just show the product and and and basically not you can show with your phone like they do on Tik Tok and and write and read that. So remark work on anxieties de green content that resonates with no that's that's absolutely not the script it's been too long I'm recording sorry I'm a little bit uh off um script one where is it okay starts here three signs your remote team is lying to you is lying to you in daily check-ins number one everything is always fine or good real humans humans have bad and brokers. Number two, they give you tasks but never mention how they are feeling about the work. Number three, you ask about blockers and and get radio silence but deadlines keep slipping. If this sounds familiar, your team isn't playing. They just don't have a safe way to tell you the truth. It's short. It's just a short form video, right? And you can generate as much as you want, as many as you want to promote your product basically. All right, so that's the end of this video. It was really long as usual, but I hope that you um understood the framework properly and learned um few things along the way. Um the as I said, the prompts are available. There is a link in the description. Um it's not a free product, but it's not an expensive product neither. I I really want to keep that knowledge uh accessible to as many developers as possible. Um and I hope that you will find the value um that you can get in it. This is literally something that can take anyone that has absolutely no marketing experience uh that turn them into like having a marketing machine to generate content that sell uh at scale basically. So um if you have any question post it in the comments and um I will post other videos probably about this Facebook this framework uh and other that I also have uh in the pipe coming soon. I'm taking a little bit of time between each videos because I'm also focusing on client work. Um but yeah, it's coming soon and uh I see you in the next video. Bye-bye.
