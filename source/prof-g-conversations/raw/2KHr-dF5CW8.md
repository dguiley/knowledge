I think it's kind of cool that um these three Rogue States I talk about North Korea Iran and Russia their leaders are all 5'7 that's interesting you know nobody talks about that different sizes different sizes and shapes so small man syndrome though maybe that's the biggest risk that no one's talking about a small man [Music] syndrome Ian where does this podcast find you I am in New York City back home back from uh the South Pole an Arctica is that right back from the South Pole yeah it was a crazy trip I've always wanted to do it it was uh about as hard as I imagined but was pretty rewarding I'm glad I went yeah that sounds that sounds crazy but a nice a nice Escape it seems like that is arguably the most stable place in the world it is it's the first um Arms Control agreement that was signed between the US and the Soviets and that treaty from 1959 is holding true uh will until 2048 that's the next time we have to all sit down and discuss it there's no um use for military exercises or basing there's no natural resource exploitation there are no uh territorial disputes and of course there are no people particularly which also makes it easier um but yeah it was nice to be in a piece of territory that was so big also no internet uh so it was like a week and a bit of just uh just connecting with uh with this little ball we're on they they worse things to do the of the year so more Penguins that's the answer to World Peace okay so let's bust right into it you published or your Asia group published a list of the biggest risks in 2024 and I've already pared it I love that you said that Israel's at war with Hamas Ukraine's at war with Russia and America is at war with itself let's start there America is at war with itself aren't we doesn't it feel that way 100% yeah say more say more uh well uh you know I I'm I'm not going to sit here and say it's all about Trump um I think that Trump is a symptom and he's certainly making it worse but you know we we put in the report we went and we looked at American Trust for all of these institutions in the country the Supreme Court Congress the presidency organized religion Public Schools newspaper internet news they've all been going down they've all been going down for decades they're reaching crisis levels three years of Biden as president I mean I I I'd like to believe that he is trying to uh end this challenge but he's not in any way been successful the US is more divided um and polarized 3 years after the Biden presidency than it was when he first came in so this is not going to get fixed no matter what the outcome of the election is the stakes of the election are much higher for Trump their Jail uh Biden and his team believe that if Trump wins he will politicize the doj the FBI the IRS and other organiz ations that they will face legal Jeopardy themselves so it's becoming increasingly existential on a personal basis for the leaders of these two movements and well before we get to the election itself which is a very juicy Target for people in and outside the US that would like chaos in America and more broadly um you have the fact that Trump is very soon very likely to get the nomination and when he gets the nomination he will become far more powerful immediately he will have the Republican Party declaring loyalty to him with their media um and with a lot of money and that means that his policies his stated policies whether it's on Ukraine and ending support for zalinski or it's on the Middle East and showing the Iranians what's what or it's on the border or it's on the treatment of Muslims or any trade with the Chinese all of those will become policies not that he's just throwing out there but that are being supported by half of the country and and that has an imp well before the election in November so for all of those reasons it was inconceivable to me that we wouldn't have the United States as the top risk for 2024 and I say this as someone who back when I started my company in 1998 we didn't even focus on domestic politics in the United States because a Consolidated democracy I mean why would you bother and and now I mean it's the most important Focus what do you think uh what are the root causes of this is it income inequality young people not doing as well for the first time as older Generations is it social media platforms that are polarizing us including some that are controlled by you might argue Bad actors if you were to try and diagnose the underlying cancer not just the tumor but what is driving division in the US and I agree with you I I think we could from our interests handle I want to say handle Ukraine but deal with it deal with the conflict in the Middle East that's thing that might might disrupt the world order is if the global cop or the most prosperous economy the Multicultural democracy whatever you want to call us starts to fall apart of the seams what what is the cancer here I I think I to the extent there's an answer there's one answer um that that matters to me I I I have it and I'll give it to you but I want to say a couple things that I think will help set the stage for that answer which is that you know I I travel around the world a lot uh and talk with foreign leaders uh in the way that you talk to you know a lot of students a lot of Business Leaders here in the United States and and there's an analogy every leader I talk to of every us Ally is deeply concerned about the state of US democracy and believes that if Trump wins there is going to be chaos against the context of a couple of major Wars that is really dangerous that's really problematic they don't want it and yet they are unwilling to say any of that publicly because well Trump might win and then they're going to have to work with him which feels just like the way CEOs talk about it which feels just like the way republicans in Congress talk about it and so you do have this Collective action problem of it's getting worse and worse incrementally and we normalize it we normalize all of it and the reason being is because we have lots of good reasons good reasons in the near term term that our own personal interests business interests National interest tell us that well someone else should deal with that problem because we've got to go along to get along and I I that's not the reason for the problem but there are a lot of things that are facilitating it getting worse and this is one of them you know I mean American Allies if they really care about us they should be out there saying you guys cannot allow your democracy to implode and no we think that Trump is a real danger because I mean if all of the leaders of these countries around the world were to say publicly what they are saying to me privately that would have an impact on on the way the average American thinks about this election going forward it would but they won't say it if all the corporate leaders were to do that it would have an impact but they won't say it if if Republicans that felt that way privately said it it would have an impact but they won't say it and so all you have are the partisans saying it and it's in their interest anyway and so nobody believes it and I mean it does seem to me that if you have an election where the former president who did everything in his capacity to overturn illegally a free and fair election is then running again in any normal well-functioning democracy that would be the number one issue but the United States is not a normal well-functioning democracy so it is not the number one issue now you you mentioned a bunch of stuff that I think all is relevant and I know that you've been very thoughtful about this you've written about it you've spoken about it you and I have spoken about it so of course I think inequality plays and identity politics plays uh but I I think that if there were one thing I would focus on in the United States that's really made a difference it would be that over the last 40 years the nurture part of raising Americans has eroded across the board that all of the institutions like the family and church and Community groups and little league and all of the rest like those institutions have gotten weaker and more atomized and our young people are less affected by them and so we don't we still have genetics we still have nature but nurtur is falling down on the job in the United States we don't have that in a way that Japan still does and a way that a lot of Europeans still do to a greater degree and replacing that for a while nothing replaced it but for the last 15 years something has replaced it and that's algorithm and now we're raising people in America through algorithms algorithmically uh and and that is not raising them to be good citizens and to be functional as you beings it's raising them to divide and to hate and to feel anger and to feel tribal um and to be better consumers and more addicted but algorithms do not replace nurture they really don't and there's no regulation around this the business models are anti-human uh I think if if I had to put my finger on one thing it would be replacing nurture with algorithm I like that or I think that's really a great word nurture David Brooks has written eloquently on this for a long time yeah and I find that the left is afraid to talk about the importance of church and community and nod their head to the importance of dual parent homes for fear that it comes across as being I don't know not not Progressive what do you think of the idea of national service mandatory national service as a means of trying yeah I love it I love it no I love it uh I mean I talk with Chris Coons who's one of my best friends in Washington about this all the time it doesn't have to be um you know the Peace Corp it doesn't have to be military uh but it has to be some form of volunteerism that's Civic young people need to be a part of something that is bigger than themselves one of the reasons Israel has been so successful for its own citizens not for the Palestinians obviously is because everyone has to engage in service that's where that's where you meet everybody it's a leveler and and by the way one of the things that's been positive about about this war in Gaza and there's almost nothing that's been positive is that the far right in Israel the hium who used to always say we don't want any part in national service are now increasingly saying no we we don't want that exception we think that we need to actually fight like everybody else does We Can't Be Free Riders we need to be a part of the country and that will help integrate the Israeli people together to a greater degree I think that's important so before we actually talk about the conflict um between Israel and Hamas let's talk about the perception of the conflict here in the US I'm curious if you've been as shocked as I have been um I grew up so I'm Jewish my mother made name LaVine uh but I never felt any connection to Judaism or Israel and if someone had said to me I have quite a few Jewish friends who talk fairly frequently about anti-Semitism and it's still all over the world and we're still ripe with this this rot that is anti-Semitism and quite frankly I was said I don't see it I don't feel it I think you're overplaying your hand and being a little bit paranoid and then this happens October 7th happens and I have been profoundly rattled and just flumed at the level of anti-Semitism in the US One what has been your reaction to or your thoughts around and and do you agree with that this level of let's not even call anti-Semitism let's call anti-israel sentiment in the US 70% of people my age support Israel 20% of people under the age of 25 18 to 24 year olds 50% support Hamas what is what is your reaction to this uh America's response if you will since October the 7th and where do you think it comes from again what if you can what is going on here well um it it's complicated I I'm not going to sit here and say that anti-Semitism is not a big structural problem in the United States um it obviously is we saw it with the Tree of Life attack the Pittsburg synagogue which was shocking in terms of the level of violence people were not ready for that and that was well before October 7th I'm not Jewish I was raised Catholic but I've faced a lot of anti-Semitism for people that assume I'm a Jew I don't know because I'm intellectual and have glasses um uh mostly on social media but not only I mean death threats and the rest which has kind of been shocking to me right that's obviously if if you're hitting that to me then I mean just imagine what my Jewish friends are getting hit with right so I I I get that I I think that the anti-israeli sentiment is much more understandable the United States is quite isolated in its level of support for Israel today uh other countries around the world including most us allies do not support this government to anywhere close the degree that the United States does politically um part of that is nyah's democratic failings inside his country the Judiciary the corruption all of the rest some of pigot right extremism and bigotry on the knesset right some of this is earned members members of his own cabinet who are calling for ethnic cleansing of Gaza which is the opposite of what the United States should be standing for we don't know what our values are anymore today in America which is part of this top risk um but but to the extent that we have values that we believed in historically ethnic cleansing you know let's leave aside the treatment of the natives in the United States but we we don't believe that that's what we actually stand for that's not those aren't the values enshrined to the Declaration of Independence ethnic cleansing so that's a problem that that nyah's government represents that but also we in the United States like underdogs you see it in March Madness and we love the Cinderella 16 um you see it in Ukraine you know we we didn't we thought they were going to lose and we're trying to help get zinski out and then he says no I don't need a ride I need ammo um and and they fight and we say you know what we're going to stand up for these guys because you know we don't care much about Ukraine but we support the underdog and we don't like the idea the Russians are coming in and destroying these people and you know Israel has been making this argument that they face an existential threat from Hamas and it's not true it's not true um they they faced more violence against the civilian population in the most brutal possible form that any Jews have seen since the Holocaust on October 7th and and we must condemn that without any caveat but Israel has the ability to defend itself and the reason they didn't defend themselves is because nanahu took his eye off the ball supported Hamas and took the IDF and the Border controls off of Gaza and focused on taking more land of the Palestinians and the West Bank with the settler populations so that he could stay in power because that was the nature of his coalition government now Israel has by far the strongest military in the Middle East largely through their own capacity but also bolstered and supported by the US their defenses Iron Dome we provide that support we help them defend themselves the Israelis have a right to self-defense of course they do the Palestinians also should have a right to defend themselves they should have a right to govern themselves but they do not have that right and I think that a lot of Americans especially Young Americans who are increasingly cynical about the legitimacy of American institutions look at what's happening to the Palestinians and say yeah these horrible things were done to the Israelis yes yes okay I don't believe that a majority of young people are sympathetic to to Hamas you will find that on social media and it will be exploited and expanded by people that can't stand them I get it but that's not the majority but I think the majority of young people look at these Palestinians and they say wow Israel's rich and they've got all these weapons and they don't care what happens to these Palestinians they're going to defend themselves and it doesn't matter how many Palestinians die and and Biden has slowly but surely and blinkin come to try to understand that sentiment of the United States supporting an underdog that I think that's a big part of what young people are feeling in the United States tday I don't I don't think we should be surprised by it in some ways we should be inspired by it but we need to channel it much more constructively um than what we're seeing today so I I I think it's difficult a lot of people will say there's a difference between anti-Semitism and being anti-israel and that is a legitimate Fair Point and I've been and I know you have critical of Netanyahu and I mean I think you're a little bit younger than me but we're kind of the same age yeah absolutely for Israel among Our Generation I think was the 67 war and fighting back against Goliath it was 72 as Munich they were the good you know they were the good guys and they were and they were The Underdogs that's right and and slowly but surely kind of transitioned to the bad guys at least in the eyes of of of younger Americans and the eyes of the world do you do you sense though what I sense in that is I'll use a recent current event I think it was sulaman I forget his name the Iranian senior security um uh officer who was taken out by a us drone they had a memorial Forum terrorism I think a 100 plus people killed front page and then and it's getting tons of coverage and then they find out Isis takes credit for it right and then it just disappears yeah and I interpreted and maybe this is incorrect but I interpret it as oh it's just Muslims killing Muslims that's okay but when Jews do something it gets much more scrutiny and a much finer eye and I joked on my and this is well I I I used an analogy that if you wanted to bring more attention to the fentel crisis just start a conspiracy theory that Jews are responsible for trafficking it I'm ass sure that Alex has already done that right I mean so we just need to we just need to that's when you compare me to Alex Jones but it it seems to me that and I look at this war Israel is not allowed to win a war they're allowed to respond to aggression and and and prosecute it to a truce and then they're expected to to okay now hold up whereas when al- Qaeda comes in and kills 2,800 Americans we respond by killing 400,000 people World War II I mean you can just go on and on and on that they are held to a different Israel is held to a different higher standard that people have decided that essentially the last true Christians in the world should be Jews I sense a double standard do you see that same double standard or is there is there more play here um I think the reason that it got more coverage when people thought it might have been Israel and it made no sense no experts would have thought it was Israel because it was not a targeted military assassination or attack it was a whole bunch of civilians getting killed that's not the way Israel engages in fights so it it should have been obvious this wasn't Israel it got coverage I think in part because of the focus on what Israel is doing and some of that I'm sure is anti-Semitism inform formed by anti-Semitism but also because if it was Israel it was very likely to significantly escalate the war and that has a very meaningful impact for the United States for our economy for our troops in the region all the rest so I think it was very legitimate that got a lot more attention and when it's Muslims on Muslims yeah we don't care we should care but we don't care and that reflects islamophobia and a different value of Muslim life um out there in the Middle East or in the global South Indonesia Nigeria you name it than if it's people that look like us like the ukrainians who are Europeans and white so I mean I would I would not solely put that focus on on the question as you raised it uh but I think it's part of it um so I mean is there a double standard uh the Americans should have taken out Al-Qaeda that was perfectly reasonable uh a 20-year war against Afghanistan not to mention Iraq which had nothing to do with the fight uh does not seem like a legitimate response by the United States now the US of course operates in a different standard because the US is the most powerful country in the world and all other countries rely on it to different degrees so you can criticize the United States but if your government on many cases you've got to suck it up that is not the Case for Israel right Israel is in a much stronger position today because they have normalized relations through the Abraham Accords for example and so the geopolitically they were in a much better position they have been at any point since Independence before the October 7th event and some of that is still true today um though they've done damage to it but I I think very few people I mean if Israel were a different country we're not a Zionist Jewish state but instead were another dominant military country um that we felt neutral towards and someone uh engaged in terrorism against them and killed you know uh a thousand of their citizens and they respond with a multi-month war that kills tens of thousands of civilians I think you get outrage absolutely I think you get outrage and in in to a degree that outrage has been minimized by the fact that the United States is an incredibly powerful protector of Israel and the Israeli government has the ability to say screw you to everybody else because they have that support from the United States which they know will not go anywhere they know is not at threat in the form of two carrier strike forces sitting offshore right for example and not only but also intelligence cooperation and continued provision of critical uh defense materials like Iron Dome and all the rest so all of that is real I mean Israel is the one country that has a nuclear a significant nuclear force and has never admitted to actually having a nuclear force is that a double standard in Israel's favor that they're allowed to do that uh yeah probably but I mean historically it's because you know there are good reasons for us to support the existence of an Israeli state where Jews can defend themselves we that comes out of the Holocaust I feel that history but it's hard for that that history doesn't last forever and especially when their own government is under mining their own democratic values and is committing atrocities against civilians and yes Hamas is also responsible even for those atrocities because they operate in those civilian areas and they put their own people at risk but anyone who thinks that the civilian casualties are only the responsibility of Hamas and not of the Israeli government at all is crazy like that's not acceptable and and that's a position the Americans were on the wrong side of two months ago and that Tony blinkin is trying to tack back ineffectually because he doesn't have a lot of influence but he's more aligned with uh most of the world and many many Americans as a consequence of doing that this a no win for Biden and I think it's going to affect the elections I think it's going to undermine them and that is that is if the war stays where it is but you said where' the war going far more likely this war is going to expand go going forward if it does in fact become a regional conflict where do you think that where do you think that fires up and what do you think happens do you think we're slowly but surely being drawn into a a regional conflict do you think because my sense is the Arab states other than uh Iran don't have appetite for that as well Iran doesn't have appetite for it either um the big states don't want it um the Israeli War cabinet is more tolerant of it um the houthis in Yemen certainly are moving in that direction um and Hamas and Hezbollah are increasingly moving uh Hamas is all in and Hezbollah is increasingly moving in that direction but isn't Hezbollah effectively a proxy Force for Iran um yes but proxy force is does not mean that they are being ordered I mean the Iranians have been very happy to continue to provide weapons and for these forces to attack Israel yes and the United States but Iran does not want to be involved in that fight itself that's somewhat analogous to the United States with Ukraine and NATO with Ukraine right um but at some point if this war continues um the Iranians could easily get involved now we're several steps away from that if the United States start attacking the houthis in their bases in Yemen we get a little bit closer um if the Iranian proxies in Syria and Iraq start attacking American bases with significant casualties on the part of American servicemen and women we get closer if the Israelis engage in direct strikes against Iran not like the ISIS attack but you know targeted military strikes we get closer if Trump becomes the nominee and starts calling for direct military attacks against Iran and the Republicans move in that direction we get closer um I mean you know if Hezbollah is involved in a direct War uh with Israel and the US is providing lots of intelligence support and some uh military uh support even if they're not directly involved in the fighting we get closer now none of that is a regional war with the Americans fighting Iran if we get into a a hot war between the Americans and the Iranians Biden is going to lose and we'll be in a global recession and oil prices will be 15 15200 or more we're several steps away from that but but we are not as I said I don't think we land where we are right now I think we land in between those two places with a risk that an allout war is is possible I I think that's that's where we are this is a a horribly dangerous environment Biden hates it he knows it's a problem but there's actually very little he can do to stop it that's what we've seen over the last 3 months is that he's been very ineffectual in being able to contain Israeli decision makers we'll be right back so you've been very indulgent with me I'm obviously very preoccupied with u Israel and Hamas so we'll do a lightning round on some of these mind so you you wrote in your kind of your wrist for 2024 that you thought um Ukraine would be partitioned yeah go ahead I I fear that that is not going to go over well um among a lot of people that um are Allin for Ukraine uh it has been I mean you can get pasted pretty badly publicly uh for for not being seen as sufficiently patriotic in your support for Ukraine I I want to be very clear that when I say that Ukraine is going to be partitioned I do not believe that is right it is not just I do not favor it um I want the ukrainians to be able to take back all of their territory I believe they should be able to do so um but it's not going to happen and I'm not going to lie to people and there are lots of things that we don't like that we find unacceptable but we have to live with North Korea has nuclear weapons we've said it's unacceptable okay it's not a policy you know Taliban can't run Afghanistan 20 years later there they are Assad's in Syria so Ukraine's going to be partitioned but it's not going to be accepted or recognized by Ukraine or by the Americans or by most of the Europeans it might be by some and zalinski is likely to get increasingly desperate as a consequence of that and that's even before we start talking about a potential president Trump who if he wins NATO is going to get fragmented and Ukraine is going to be thrown under the bus and the poles and the bals and the fins and the swedes are going to be very very deeply concerned about that in a way that NATO will not be providing support the US will not be providing support so I I think that there's there's a lot of time pressure right now on zalinski and the average age of a Ukrainian drafty today is about 45 it was 26 when the war started they only have 44 million people uh I mean their ability to keep fighting to maintain even the 82% of the territory that they now control is going to get a lot harder so um yeah looking forward I me the last two years I would argue I would give Biden an A minus in the way he's managed the Ukraine war since 2022 I think he's done a good job especially in marshalling bipartisan support in the US and Broad support among American Allies not just in NATO but even countries like Japan and Australia and South Korea has gotten a lot of support for Ukraine and he's kept those countries all together and on side I think that's now starting to fall apart fall apart domestically fall apart internationally not helped by the fact that Ukraine's counter offensive much vaunted and expected was a failure um and Putin knows it and he and he knows that he needs to hang tight to see if Trump wins in which case he's hit the jackpot so and and you know we we're 40 minutes into the conversation before you're even asking me about Ukraine it's not what you're interested in I remember when the war was you know just about to start and I was with you in Miami and we had this conversation and everyone's like it's going to be okay I'm like no this is going to be a [ __ ] disaster like I'm sorry but like you know the next few days this war is going to start then the war started um and that was pretty intense but Americans this is this is not a priority right now the Middle East is the priority blinken's been you know in Israel four times since October 7th uh I mean you know uh the Secretary of Defense when he's not uh Missing uh in the hospital has been traveling to the Middle East um the National Security adviser uh they're not going to Ukraine uh and if they're not worried about the Middle East they're worried about the elections so I mean Ukraine is a distant third maybe even fourth these days compared to the Border issue on some on some weeks you're just not going to be able to continue to provide the ukrainians the support they need to fight this war that's that's where we're going I mean hasn't Russia at the end of the day leveraged their core competence and that as a willingness to endure just immense amount of suffering and patience yes they have Scott yes they have but but they are not winning they will be able to take over a fair amount of territory in Ukraine at the expense of NATO having expanded signicantly far more their B to defend lost a third of their kinetic power I mean it's been they've lost incredible reputational Capital right Frozen half of their International assets can't trade with Europe anymore can't send gas is going to be uh stranded they won't have the pipelines to send it any place else a million of their population fleeing so they capable smart men that they need for their economy I mean this has been a horrible situation for Russia let's go to China r quick a thesis you respond to it uh the West has an inflation problem or a threat of inflation U rebounding China has a growth problem our IP our Capital our consumer economy their manufacturing economy wouldn't the greatest tax cut in history be for uh a thaw in the relations between us and China and don't they have a mutual interest that just brings them back together in 2024 there I think is a mutual interest to at least manage the relationship more effectively thaw is hard to imagine they don't trust each other at all there are lots of areas of conflict that are zero sum the Taiwan relationship depending on how the election goes next week would be one big piece of that South China Sea territorial issues um and the export controls the US is putting in place on semiconductors cloud computing and other pieces of advanced technology the Chinese don't have access to so there are hard things to unwind but uh given the economic challenges given the geopolitical dangers in the rest of the world and given the United States election coming up neither Biden nor she are looking for yet another crisis and I think that the flurry of highlevel bilateral engagement we've seen between the United States and China on the Diplomatic economic and Military fronts over the past months is likely to persist through the election it will not create an onun it will not create a breakthrough but it will be a better managed relationship than it had been for most of the first three years of the Biden Administration you also wrote and this really struck me and we disagree on this issue your predictions that my prediction was totally contrary to this to the one the RIS you outline you think there's going to be a rebound or that inflation will persist in 24 say more yeah um I I think that it's going to uh persist more than the markets presently think I think the markets are pricing in more uh more reduction uh in interest rate by the US Central Bank by the FED um than than we believe is going to happen um I think that the geopolitical risks that I spoke about are going to cause more supply chain challenges I think that the um the the likelihood of un unforeseen risks the last two years we've had Russia Ukraine the last year we had Israel Hamas I think there's going to be more in this environment and I think that makes it more challenging to suddenly bring rates down significantly uh what we say is no room for error in other words everything has to go kind of right for the markets to be correct about the the soft Landing that is going to be engineered in the United States and I would bet on that not being as successful this is a comparatively low risk in our report it's only number eight number eight out of 10 and it involves the whole world and especially the United States and given that we measure our risk on the basis of likely imminence and impact that means that we're not saying no room for error is an American recession what we're saying is that right now we believe the markets are priced for Perfection especially around the fed and we expect that that the the reality of that outcome is going to disappoint somewhat on the downside yeah to your point the market is pric in several rate Cuts in 24 exactly but I would I would argue and I'd like you to respond to this that because these conflicts have been going on for a while that a lot of Supply chains have demonstrated agility and for example a lot of Mexico is now our largest trading partner it's no longer China y people are saying there was so little slack in the system everything was so optimized for cost that when whether it was covid or war in Ukraine we found that the part for garage doors or batteries it just totally mucked up or gunked up the supply chain and slowly but surely I see corporations UNG gunking or creating more diversification heterogenity in their supply chain in addition I think AI is highly deflationary because if you look at inflation one of the stickiest Parts at least in the US of inflation has been wage pressure and I think people in Services Industries are going to have a lot not on the front lines but I'm talking about lawyers sort of like you know white collar services are going to have much less confidence asking for raises as they look around over their shoulder at generative Ai and worry that their job's about to be replaced I I see I I think we might actually have deflation in 24 what are your thoughts it's interesting uh I find your second argument very compelling I don't know if it comes fast enough I I I I thought it was very interesting and a little surprising to me to see how far and hard um the UAW was willing to fight at a time for much higher wages and win and benefits at a time when electric vehicles and drivetrain and batteries and all of the rest are are are going to push for far less skilled less well-paid workers uh I mean that has the potential to really backlash for them but we didn't do it and and that implied to me that um as much as this AI uh and new technology train which is coming which is massive which is going to be deflationary um until it is really seen at scale labor has if they've got if they're in a position where they have an advantage they're going to use it and they're not going to think long-term and strategically so I'm not sure this plays out in 2024 but I agree completely with your analysis I think it's coming I think the question is when it's coming how it's coming um I agree with your UNG gunking and creation of resilience in Supply chains but I also see huge political drivers uh of industrial policy National policies subsidies that are increasing costs dramatically in that new environment this is not a free trade environment this is an environment where even the Americans and the Europeans are hitting each other with tariffs and hitting each other with export controls and you know Carbon border adjustment mechanisms that the Europeans have which don't work well with the Americans are going to hurt the global Sou Global South with critical minerals and they want to get up the supply chain so they're going to make it much more costly for you to do that new business I mean the politics are really invasive here and they create significant costs now some of those costs create redistribution which is necessary for the social contract some of it is nationalism corruption and wasted and I don't have a good sense of you know where the balance of the scale Falls between those two but I know it's costly in in the near term I I don't think I think either of us is right or wrong on this I think that the truth is in between but it's a question of when it's going to hit right that's the issue you mentioned the upcoming election in Taiwan which I would argue is the most underreported um story relative to its importance what in your view is the biggest risk that is getting no coverage right now yeah uh Taiwan is I think getting a fair amount of coverage um but it's you know among I would bet 90% of Americans don't even know there's an election I think a lot of people have heard about the election they don't know when it is but they've heard oh yeah Taiwan elections I think people have said it because you know there's been a lot of conversation in Congress about war and the Pelosi visit and all that kind of stuff I mean it's played out um the fact is that um there's a 50-50 chance that the guy that is pro-independence though he was not going to put it that way is not going to win so I mean next week that risk could go away um and if he does win I I think that there will be some trade challenges and there may be at the the extreme stream some inspections of boats some forcible boarding by the Chinese more exercises but I think the stuff is manageable because of the reason what's the risk what's the risk we're not talking about well I mean there are definitely risks we're not talking about one that doesn't matter but it matters a lot locally is the Horn of Africa doesn't matter economically or strategically but Ethiopia is about to be at war with Somalia because they're going to recognize a breakaway secessionist Province it's going to give them access to portway I mean no one's going to care it's not going to get any attention but it really matters if you're Ethiopian or Somalian I mean I don't know I think that that's a pretty big deal um North Korea gets very little attention I it was Kim jong-un's birthday by the way I think it's kind of cool that um these three Rogue States I talk about North Korea Iran and Russia their leaders are all 5 foot7 I think that's interesting you know nobody talks about different sizes different sizes and shapes so small man syndrome though maybe that's the biggest risk that no one's talking about a small man syndrome paint the optimistic case around 24 in the US what do you think the optimistic I find that when generally speaking when we're really worried about stuff that the market in the world climbs the wall of worry yeah yeah yeah and it strikes me that when we're most worried and most anxious about things that things usually it's the [ __ ] you're not expecting that hits you hard right it feels like we're expecting such doom and disaster I've never felt such negative sentiment going into 24 and I don't know if it's CU I'm getting older or because things are really scary right now but what's the optimistic scenario for the us through 24 well the realistic optimistic scenario is that Biden either Biden wins Big um or Nikki Haley gets the nomination on the Republican side and then she wins Big either of those two would be optimistic scenarios I think they're very unlikely um like sub 10% but they could happen and and that's a jackpot like if Nikki Haley is able to come in a very strong second or even first in New Hampshire take South Carolina get a wall of money she's suddenly the favorite people can become favorites very very quickly Trump attacks her attacks her attacks her throws her a whole bunch more tension she is now getting huge attention in the United States people are plausibly talking about her as the first woman president um yeah I think she beats Biden too oh she she crushes Biden it's not even close but I mean then you have a free and fair election and Trump is a washed up loser after four elections that he can't get right and you know he's still facing legal Jeopardy and maybe she pardons him but she pardons him in part with a promise that he goes away that would be huge I I think it's very unlikely the other unlikely scenario is Biden wins by such a large margin that Trump and his supporters who refuse to accept it go nowhere and the Republican Party jettison Trump trump May create his own party in that environment uh but he only has a group of rum supporters and the Republican Party falls apart and eventually coalesces into something else and Trump is irrelevant but you do have like you know paramit crazies in the US but they're not an extent threat to the system um and uh you know that's that and you no longer have Biden is you know too old to be president but he allows somebody else to take over after a year after two years and then you move to another Generation Um that won't resolve the deep-seated challenges that Americans have that you and I talked about earlier in the conversation but it gives us some breathing room right and right now this is a country that needs breathing room this the country that really does not need to have an election in 2024 this election we we'd all be much happier if this election we're in 2028 right for every reason we don't want this election right now don't and I recognize this statement is r with bias but I think there's some legitimacy and some veracity behind it don't all the rivers of risk kind of lead to the Amazon of risk and that is a reelection of Donald Trump no no I think that that is a bias because Trump in my view is of course it's much worse if Trump wins I get that but but he is not the problem he is a symptom of a much bigger structural challenge in the world's largest democracy which is dysfunctional it is not in crisis because of Trump trump has taken advantage of a system that is weak and vulnerable and deteriorating and eroding that people don't believe in and you need to turn that around that that I think is the problem it's too easy to blame this on a guy I I don't believe that that is where we are just saying that I this also you you said that it involves a bias uh but you think it's true my response involves a bias my bias is I don't want to Broad brush as irredeemable a large percentage of the American population I believe these people are misled but they're also angry for legitimate reasons and those reasons must be addressed or they will become uh increasingly hostile um and threatening I think that is we've seen that play out over and over and over again and the threat doesn't come in the final version from those people it comes from the elites that take advantage and can Channel The Rage and get the support and power from those people that is where we're heading in the United States yeah to your point I I think it would be a disaster for America if Trump is removed from the Colorado and Main ballots I agree that strikes me as as I mean last time that happened they were trying to remove Lincoln from ballots and started a civil war yeah most important and what are your New Year's resolutions for 24 what's what's up with the world of Ian Bremer and the Eurasia group well it's why I started with the South Pole I thought that you know a week and a half of no internet um was really really Valu and now you're working Your Way North no I mean just just you know you and I have talked about how polarizing and how toxic social media is and I recognized for what I do for what you do it's very important to be able to get our voice out there it would it's not feasible um to be relevant and to have influence and to be off but it's not good for my psyche uh and I say that as somebody who does not really get worked up but I just don't it just depresses me to see all of this misinformation and hate constantly so to get away completely away and to read you know some big think books about philosophy and Consciousness and anything that stick out that you especially enjoyed while you were frolicking with penguins I really enjoyed that book by Watts uh from I think it was 1953 the one that had the intro from deac Chopra it was about the uh the wisdom of insecurity I thought it was wonderful it was a great book to read at the bottom of the plan it it was a great work to book to to talk about like how irrelevant our worries our concerns are about the future and about the past and what it means to be in the present what it means to engage and enjoy what we have right now which is all we actually have and ever have I thought that was a wonderful way to start the year so this was not a year of resolutions for me this was a year of resetting of Reviving of revitalizing I was consciously aware of how hard 2024 is going to be especially not for you and me but for people you and I care about for people that you and I touch and we have to be resilient we have to have energy we have to reset to be there to have the strength for those people you know we've got to be able to give and not lash out over a really challenging year and I thought that the best way for me to do that um was uh to really recharge that was that's what I tried to do Ian Bremer is the president president and founder of Eurasia group the world's leading political risk research and consulting firm and GZ media a company dedicated to providing intelligent and engaging coverage of international Affairs he is also the author of 11 books including his latest the power of Crisis how three threats and our response will change the world he joins us from New York Ian as always it is great to converse with you and welcome back from the South Pole and most importantly he cares a lot about you Scott uh you're a really good guy I love what you do it's always a joy to spend some time either privately or publicly um as we do and it's nice to kick this off uh with you [Music] again
