can you give me any sense for the rationale or any color you want to add on the current obsession with tariffs the National Association of home builders came out with a message after the Tariff announcement that said this is going to be a catastrophe our inputs include lumber from Canada and drywall material from Mexico and now we're going to increase the taxes on those inputs by 25% this is a President Who understood his mandate which was all about unaffordability in this country to immediately raise the two key inputs of housing by 25% it's complete effing Madness at the core of their politics is suspicion of the rest of the world it is suspicion of immigrants it is suspicion of other nations it is suspicion that trade can ever be positive some that cooperation is something we should actually do that you are made Stronger by having beneficial interactions with each other gentlemen where does this podcast find you asra where are you I am in New York you're in New York and Derek I am in Chapel Hill North Carolina nice we're just talking about it I'm doing a college tour with my son and he's decided that he's interested in UNC and I asked him why and he said because of the logo and I thought well that's absolutely the right reason to pick a university so uh your new book abundance is about where America liberalism and the Democratic party went wrong over the last few decades you argue that right-wing populism thrives on scarcity and the answer is abundance let's start start there what does that abundance look like I'll start with you Derek I think abundance is a positive vision of the future that liberals can build if we get out of our own way and I think it starts first with actually having a goal this book is about politics and it's about policy but it opens actually with a Sci-Fi vignette of what the world of 2050 could look like if we get everything right in housing in energy in science and technology and governance but these are different markets and different markets have different problems and they have different bottlenecks and so part two after you have a goal of where you want to go is understanding what industries you're actually working in and a lot of this book is looking back over the last 50 years at how housing policy went wrong often in blue cities and how we failed to build clean energy in this country even when liberal cities and liberal Governors tend to say that they want to build clean energy to help climate change and then finally I think that abundance requires us identifying the bottlenecks that are in our way and the policies that we don't have yet that could improve our outcomes so for example I think it's pretty remarkable that when you think about how important Science and Technology are to improving People's Health and improving people's lives this country doesn't have a national invention agenda the Democratic party doesn't have one you might expect that Elon Musk now that he's Associated himself with the Maga movement would inscribe a kind of uh wise techno Optimist idea within that party he hasn't he has no vision of what America can be he has a vision of what he wants to to tear down and so we believe very strongly in having a positive vision for the future understanding the world and where we've gone wrong and then finally in resolving the bottleneck to actually build that future Ezra any any additional color there I mean I I'll give I'll give our I'll give our one sentence which is that the thesis of abundance is that to have the future we want we need to build and invent more of what we need abundance is a really nice word tell me on the ground what that means let's talk about energy does that mean drill baby drill like how does this notion of abundance impact our energy policy so I often get this question of if you think we've gone wrong in so many places if you think the government has hindered so much construction so much Innovation why are you not just a conservative don't we already have a Republican party the world you are trying to achieve matters when there's actually a huge uh disagreement I have with things like Doge which is efficiency towards what I hear all these Tech right people tell me that reading the government for AI and I'm like okay AI that does what what is its value function what is its prompt what are you unleashing it on you have to know what you're trying to build and the I think two of the core tributaries of the book are housing and decarbonization uh we are very very worried about the absence of sufficient housing in the big particularly the cities although not only that drive the American economy and we're simply not going to meet decarbonization goals I mean we're probably at this point not going to meet them anyway but you're not going to meet decarbonization goals if you can't build solar wind battery manufacturing facilities and and other things at a much much much faster Pace than we've seen so far and that are frankly possible under the way liberal governments including National democratic governments tend to create the rules for construction so yeah you our theory is not just more of everything I think we have a line in the book that it's not an omnidirectional mess you have to choose what you need more of look we've had also as you know better than anybody Scott uh abundance of consumer goods for a long time and behind that abundance of consumer goods where you know 40 years ago you could go to public college debt-free but you couldn't have a flat screen television uh anchored on your wall in your house now you probably can't go to college public college debt free and you can have a flat screen television so we kind of constructed government and the global economy to make the things that fill a house cheap and the things that build a life expensive Child Care Health Care education housing energy um and a set of other things that we think of as more of the building blocks of production and the building blocks of flourishing and so we in the book sort of run through these not just at a policy level but also at a more conceptual level sort of one by one housing energy State capacity these structures that lead to invention and then the structures and and ways we turn that invention into actual technology that is produced in a way people can use you have to choose and if there's any one I think uh pathology we are pulling at inside the way liberals govern and we're both you know American liberals it's that we often don't choose we l things up with too many goals too many standards too many regulations and we uh don't take seriously that if you're going to achieve anything you need to focus on achieving that thing getting anything done well it's hard and we pretend it's easy and then act surprised when we fail Derek I love the idea of abundance but I'll put forward a thesis and you respond we don't suffer from a lack of abundance what we suffer from is this oligarchical Zeitgeist where we've decided to optimize the US for the top 1% and we don't suffer from an increase in market capitalization an increase in wealth what we suffer from is policies that essentially insert certain companies in between the consumer on some public uh Goods including Health Care uh housing prison system where the objective or the metrics are shareholder value not the public good they private company inserts themselves in the middle it does a great job Innovation applies technology and then creates Market power raises the prices and we end up with one in four households with children in red states are food insecure isn't it I mean quite justes sound like a liberal is isn't our problem not abundance but quite frankly that we are slowly but surely sequestering all the abundance to the one% sometimes I would say the answer to our problems is that the oligarchy is getting in the way of achieving our outcomes but let's talk about housing for a second why is it that California has the worst affordable housing crisis in the country why is it that the five states with the highest rates of homelessness are all states that are governed by democrats is it because the oligarchy is stronger in Democratic states or is it because in place after Place governed by democrats we have allowed habits and customs and rules and regulations to get in the way of what you and I and Ezra all want which is more housing Supply right Scott your last great note uh for your great last great newsletter was about housing being the most important topic for the 2028 election right we've seen the average age of first-time homeowners go from 25 to 37 years old we now have a record high number of young people who say they cannot afford a home because the cost of housing as a share of average incomes has gone up and up and up of course I think sometimes the problems in housing have to do with incumbents but sometimes the problems in housing have to do with us ourselves and the rules that we write so you look at a place like Portland Oregon in Portland Oregon every single mayor and every single Governor that's elected says housing is our prior prity but if you ask can we build outside of the current lines uh that are drawn by the 1972 uh land use laws they say no we can't do that if you ask if you can build a new apartment building that blocks a view of Mount rineer they say actually our view of Mount reneer is more important than the additional uh than additional new housing units so I do think that of course there are many situations where the most important problem to focus on is the problem of entrenched money but in many cases for the is that you and I care most about which is housing Supply and housing abundance I think we need to take a good long look in the mirror and recognize something I think has gone wrong on our own side if the cities and the states that have the worst housing crisis are also governed by liberals and also I would say the cost of escalating housing prices is not just seen in how much housing is eating up the budgets of people who live in these cities it's also the people who are leaving these cities California is losing people New York state is losing people Illinois is losing people Minnesota is losing people working class families as Ezra just said in his beautifully done new video for the New York Times workingclass families are leaving blue States and moving the states that are more likely to be governed by Republicans of course there is there are all sorts of indictments that we can make of the power of oligarchy in this country and we can talk about the many ways that Elon Musk is turning government into some kind of kleptocratic Mania but look if we're really trying to understand why is the housing crisis worse in blue States and blue cities I think we need to look in the mirror as well Ezra you talk about or you say in the book that for a future that's progrowth prot technology and has Pro liberal values give me an example uh Beyond housing of how kind of a a pro technology progrowth and pro liberal values how that actually impacts things on the ground I think you guys could could have written your book just on housing because I think what you're saying really resonates with people where we've turned it into an investment class and turned over housing permits to homeowners and took it out of the hands of bureaucrats and homeowners have an incentive to restrict the supply but give me another example in another sector of how you think kind of being prot Tech and pro growth might change our current let's talk energy because I think energy is useful one imagine a world where it just turned out we never invented a form of energy that didn't require burning fossil fuels right we figured out natural gas we figured out oil and petroleum we figured out coal but we never invented the solar panel we never figured out what to do with a wind turbine didn't figure out Hydro power or geothermal you would have this I think politically impossible problem which is that the only way to do anything about greenhouse gas emissions would be to radically cut the living standards of functionally everybody who uses energy around the globe right there just wouldn't be another way around it you could try to make your burning of coal more efficient but if we did not keep moving the technological Frontier forward I mean I grew up I don't know where you grew up Scott but I grew up outside LA and when I grew up you still had La coated in smok you would still go in and you'd be like looking at this you'd think is it cloudy or can I not breathe today yeah remember I I grew up in remember coming home from school and your chest would hurt when you breathe in y and with crazy today and it's a way I think you know that the only future is not de growth what's crazy to is la is richer it's bigger and you can breathe the air and that happens in a lot of places I mean London used to be unfathomably smoggy I mean go back to any writing about the Industrial Revolution so okay so we didn't end up in that world we ended up in a world where due to a series by the way of policies right Government funding of research the German subsidies particularly for solar uh Chinese subsidies for the solar industry we ended up over the past 1015 years driving the price of Solar down by 90% driving the price of wind down I think it's by 79% and the battery storage around by something comparable it is only because of that genuine set of technological Miracles and I don't use Miracles here to mean just luck right that was a Hu huge amount of policy and human Ingenuity do we have any capacity to have a politics around climate change that is not just a politics of sacrifice because politics of sacrifice do not typically work and they have a terrible tendency to elect strong men from the authoritarian right you go to people and you say we're going to cut how much energy you have we're going to ration your energy nothing destabilizes a PO faster think about the yellow vest riots in France think about how comma Harris in a time of high energy prices was running not on the climate Investments of the Biden Harris Administration but on the oil and gas production increase of the Biden Harris Administration so one of the aims of the book is to repair what we think of as a dysfunctional relationship that has emerged between liberals and Technology there is a tendency to put technology I think practically after 2016 it's run by a bunch of oligarchic billionaires there's a ton of certainly in the liberal mind disinformation and propaganda on Facebook they both sort of turn on technology but there's a lot you just can't solve without technology and a lot about your politics that really change if you get the right technological advancements um we're saying we're not using housing for this example but modular housing would do a lot to change the politics of housing if you could use them in a lot of cities because you could do public housing much more cheaply and you could also do non-public housing much more cheaply uh energy and continue advance in things like modular nuclear could really really really make possible a situation where you could have countries like China and India continue to grow and continue to give people vastly Better Lives while also cutting carbon emissions it could Leap Frog the kind of development uh we went through it's also true for healthcare so I spent a lot of my career as a reporter on on Healthcare policy and sort of my intention in that reporting is I care about universal healthcare policy I was all over Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act but how valuable having any kind of health insurance is how valuable having Private health insurance is how valuable Medicare is Medicaid is is dependent on what devices treatments surgeries Pharmaceuticals are there Medicare and Medicaid that cover OIC is more valuable than Medicare and Medicaid that does not cover OIC or wovi or the other ones and if it didn't exist they would all be less valuable right they're people with huge numbers right now of autoimmune conditions we don't understand these Insurance uh products would be a hell of a lot more valuable to people if we knew how to cure those and the insurance could cover the cures so there's a lot you just can't do if you don't innovate um if we don't figure out green cement and jet fuel we're not hitting our climate targets one way or the other so liberalism has to have a technological agenda in addition to a social insurance agenda and that means taking the mechanisms and institutions of technological progress and then the distribution of the fruits of that technological progress seriously so Derek when we talk about energy policy just to steal man this that the very Republican state of Texas is now producing more wind wind energy than anyone and that economics ultimately wins out or that's a case study and ultimately that creates less less bureaucracy let the market decide more wind energy lower cost of energy more tax revenue to reinvest in our schools isn't a conservative agenda more of an abundance agenda it's interesting we've gotten a verion of this question a few times I think it's a really good question certainly Texas and Texas politicians do not have as their North Star the idea that climate change is the most important policy in the world right it is liberals it's progressives who have all of the backpack pins that say let's ban oil and let's fix climate change nonetheless as you point out you can't ignore the fact of outcomes it is Texas that is building the most renewable and it is often places like Georgia and Iowa not run by democrats but run Often by Republicans who do not value climate change as a top order priority that are building the most renewable energy and that speaks to the fact that in some cases if you allow a market to work without the interference of nimi politics you sometimes ironically end up with more Progressive outcomes this is as true in energy as you could say it is in housing what stands in the way of housing in San Francisco in Los Angeles in Boston in Portland is not demand to live there it's constrictors on Supply and in the same way I think there are people in California and New York who want to build and in Massachusetts who want to build more solar and want to build more wind but they can't do it because the political processes in these states have gotten so good at the politics of blocking that they' prevented the politics of building even building things that are in liberals interests houses solar wind geothermal even if you're a certain kind of progressive Nuclear So I think you've put your finger on a really really important tension between the processes that liberals have and the outcomes that they want why are our outcomes living in Texas if our priorities live in San Francisco that is an incredibly important question for the Progressive Movement to ask itself if it wants to answer the question and actually build the things that we say we want to build we'll be right [Music] back support for property comes from vanta trust isn't just earned it's demanded whether you're a startup founder navigating your first audit a season security

prg for $1,000 off e i see the epicenter of all the the things you're talking about or the perfect stum of bad things whether it's an obsession with scarcity or the administrative State getting in the way of objectives or losing kind of losing the plot I think the epicenter for everything you guys are talking about is my industry where you have when the dean announces we've re rejected 85% of applicants what are the faculty and the alumni do they stand up and they applaud I'm curious if you've thought about how this scarcity or non- abundance mindset has infected higher education and what policy recommendations you guys would make to address this problem I've thought about it a bit highed is not a huge focus of the book um but in some earlier some Californian and in some earlier work one of the things I think about in terms of what happened to the California the past I don't think there is a greater public achievement so not in education in the world than the University of California system oh right on my brother literally the [ __ ] on I am here because of the generosity of California taxpayers in the region of UC anyway sorry I goad it's an extraordinary I went to UC Santa Cruz I went to UCLA right like I am a full-on product of California Public Schools through California higher what was your tuition when you were going it was a long time ago um I don't remember off hand I I'm worried I'm going to give you the the out of state think I think mine was like yeah like it was like $110,000 I believe mine was $7,000 for all seven years of undergrad and grad do you remember the admissions rate at UC when you applied no for me at UCLA was 76% when I applied and I was one when I so UC had when I was in I was a [ __ ] student I had a 2.2 when I graduated high school you I had a lot of trouble paying attention um UC had a thing then called eligibility and it was a siding scale but if you got above a 3.3 or above a, 1400 on your SATs or something in between that sliding scale you were guaranteed admission to Riverside or Santa Cruz UCI or yeah and no by by the time I went UCI wasn't doing eligibility anymore because they were too too blocked up I don't know if any of them do it anymore but when I went that's how I got into Santa Cruz I qualified in on test scores but the thing is like in my lifetime and well before it having built the most remarkable Public University system the world has ever known and like take nothing away from Cal States or the community colleges there which are also great they added exactly one UC campus mer said [ __ ] did we stop building uc's for did California stop having people did we stop needing great universities but I've like looked into this and I mean one it's oh my God like the fighting in the legislature over where to go and you know who gets it and whose aux gets scored and we just stopped building a bunch of different kinds of things we can't build highspeed rail but we also need build new uc's you know we don't build houses but we also don't build enough clean energy I think the other thing I would say because I do agree with you Scott and have um pretty intense views on this I don't know I have people I respect who will tell me well you know the you know if you double or triple the size of Harvard it wouldn't be Harvard anymore and it would lose quality I don't know that I buy that but you could sure as hell open these places up to a lot more Innovation you could sure as hell do a lot of new things and put a lot of money into new institutions and I wonder about the fact that we don't I was it was a good piece in the New Yorker recently by Adam gnik is not what we're here to talk about but here's what we're talking about about the Gilded Age and he was making this point about how the robber barons were monsters in a million different ways they're also remarkable in other ways but man do they leave behind behind cultural institutions and institutions of learning Vanderbilt's a great University really is what are they all doing today what are they all doing today and he was making the point about museums and and art I was in uh Pittsburgh for a uh family event recently and man the museums are great we have like the federal government has stopped building but also there's nothing like the construction of cultural institutions that the rich did in that era right the rich of this era are you know building their you know personal rocket companies and getting their Yachts um but they're not creating like new institutions of local or for that matter National value so there's something I think about our institutional our absence of institutional ambition Elon Musk sure has the ambition to destroy things that have been built in the public sector but not to make new ones and you just kind of see this rep at there is as we stop the the narrow version of this is that as we find that we cannot build rail at any acceptable cost point we do a lot of less building of rail with tunnels in it because tunnels are expensive and they're difficult to do in other countries you do a lot more tunneling because they still believe they can build Rail and when you believe you can build Rail and actually finish it on time and on budget you'll do the hard versions of rail which include tunnels and I think there's something like that that is infected a lot of state governments for that matter the federal government a lot of societies wealthy where they just don't really believe in building great new institutions and like that's a poverty that is catching up with us and I think will continue to in the coming decades like the metaverse doesn't cut it I think it's impossible to argue against the notion that we used to have these individuals of extraordinary talent that would practice full body contact violence of capitalism and then became very civic-minded with The Spoils of that of of that full body contact violence and competition it appears now we have the former and not the latter my fear though is that waiting on the better angels of these billionaires to show up is not a strategy and that I have now become I've kind of just gone full Bernie Sanders and I'd like you both to respond to this and I believe that we just need a massive Alternative Minimum Tax my tax rate for the last 10 years has been 17% I'm very transparent about from my 30s and 40s I was averaging over 30% then I got very wealthy and my tax rate has been cut in half I mean in order to make these sorts of big bold investments in rail in UC and still have the money to pay for our defense department Medicaid Medicare doesn't it simply quite frankly just come down to restoring a progressive tax policy Derek any thoughts sure I'm absolutely a fan of restoring progressive tax policy in this country you know we're progressives in the American tradition which means that we believe in big muscular programs in the New Deal in the in the style of the new deal we believe in Social Security we believe in Medicare and Medicaid we know that we're going to continue to have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on defense not only to defend the country but also to invest in military technology to keep Americans and countries that have American values safe but also yes institutions cost a lot of money uh Next Generation energy costs money to build and sometimes it even costs money to subsidize right Fusion technology does not exist right now and getting it off the ground might be a very expensive Enterprise the with building highspeed rail across the country if that's what we want to do so absolutely I believe that progressivism requires sufficient funding but I also think that an important part of this book an important framework of abundance subtly nudges the question toward the opposite side of the Ledger which is how do we solve the problems that we have with Supply not the demand that comes from taxpayer money which is important but also the Strate that comes or the outcomes that come from expanding Supply in a way that's the unspoken question that we've been circling around this this whole conversation in hous doing how do we solve the affordable housing crisis with Supply with not reducing a corporate income tax but actually reducing a building tax in the cities that have the highest demand for housing and where we have the highest rates of homelessness in energy how do we make it easier to build not only oil and you know Drilling and fracking for natural gas but also building the the next generation of clean energy technology in solar wind geothermal and Beyond even nuclear even in science institutions the answer to your question how do we deal with the fact that education and college costs in this country have gone through the roof and it is prohibitively expensive now to afford four years of excellent Elite College in this country well how do we solve that problem with Supply how do we train our eyes in the fact that the UC system essentially stopped building new branches and new schools and in fact it's not just the UC system I mean name an elite college that has been founded in the last 100 years I think two of the last ones that are in the top 25 of any kind of us news and World Report ranking are things like Chicago and Stanford which are over a hundred years old it's been a century that we've taken a time out from building the kind of Institutions that we used to spring up and pop up every five years in the last half of the 19th century and Ezra's point I don't think it's a coincidence at the same time that we were inventing things left and right and building houses and building roads and building canals and building Telegraph wires in the late 19th century we were also building institutions and there was some strange thing in the air that even some of the most unethical people in this country who did stuff like with like Rockefeller did to the train industry of using his Monopoly power to essentially shut down companies and start riots nonetheless had a bone in his body that said I want to use my money to build something new that doesn't exist yet why doesn't that bone exist in the bodies of billionaires today so I do think that on top of your very important point that a critical part of Shoring up government finances the next generation is going to be having sufficient tax revenue and that sufficient tax revenue is going to be necessary to build a lot of the things in the physical world expensive things that we want to build I also want us to think about the question how do we solve this problem with Supply and think about all the various stations and departments and Corners that that question can apply to even outside of the scope of our book which is as we've said focused so much on housing and energy and science I I want to say these questions are not distinct from each other and I particular want to say here look I'm I will tax a rich to any level anybody wants to tax a rich I think the marginal value of those dollars they're just points on a board at a certain point and we should be taxing the [ __ ] out of them and we still got to use that tax money well and the reason California has not built has absolutely failed to build High-Speed Rail is not tax dollars we tax plenty in California and China has a hell of a lot less in tax dollars per capita than we do and they've built 23,000 miles of highspeed rail in the time California has failed to build 500 in New York City and New York state taxes here are high it's a fairly High tax jurisdiction uh at least compared to other places the Second Avenue subway highest uh cost per kilometer of rail ever recorded in human history there's no amount of taxing we can do that is going to allow us to build a bunch of Subway if it's all going to cost like that and by the way the next phases are projected to cost more we have to use taxpayer dollars well and the fact that rich people have too much money and we should tax more of it doesn't exempt us from the need to use taxpayer dollars well and I think this is a a conceptual and political mistake Democrats and liberals make a lot because tax and rich is popular it's great but the reason people don't trust us on all kinds of things and something I try to keep telling people is like yeah Donald Trump won in 2024 on cost of living he won because people trusted him on inflation over Democrats but if you go look at exit polls in 2020 when people were tired of Donald Trump he was even with Joe Biden on the economy and if you go look at 2016 he was ahead of Hillary Clinton on the economy even as he lost the popular vote people do not trust Democrats on the economy they don't trust Democrats to spend your money well and part of the reason is we often don't spend people's money well now musk and Trump don't give a [ __ ] about where money is being spent well and poorly they're trying to gut the Social Security Administration which spends money incredibly effectively incredibly effectively they're gutting the IRS and when you cut people at the IRS they don't audit rich people and you lose money right they're they're not trying to save money they're not trying to make government more efficient but there is not an amount of money we can tax people people where that is going to lead to the kind of public infrastructure we want if we cannot build that public infrastructure AOC has a bill to do more public housing that's great I am all I want public housing to be palatial I want it everywhere but if we force public housing to operate under the rules that it currently does which makes it much more expensive to build public housing Brandon Johnson the mayor of Chicago just tweeted out trying to brag about this that they had spent um I think it was 1.1 what was it 11 billion it was I I believe was 11 billion on 10,000 AFF units coming out to 1.1 Milli or yeah maybe it's 10,000 so yeah it's coming out to $1.1 million per affordable housing unit funded by the city we can't be spending $1.1 million on affordable housing unit and the answer is not we should tax rich people more maybe we should but everybody's getting taxed there deserves a better return on their dollar than $1.1 million for this so yeah tax rich people more oligarchy is a big problem I'm very worried about oligarchy of attention we have most of the world's attention being dominated on various social media platforms by like five guys who are all lined up next to each other at Donald Trump's inauguration I've seen a bunch of people be like well what about political power yeah political power is a big problem but one way you get political power is you convince people you're using their money well and to do that you have to accept and admit that you've been using it badly and tell people you got a plan to do it better in the future or they don't trust you and in a lot of cases they don't trust us now and they have a good reason for that I don't want to spend too much time harping on the poor mayor of Chicago whose approval rating at this point is way below the Mendoza Line but I think it's really important to distinguish that form of liberalism from the kind of liberalism we're advancing in this book there's a kind of checkbook liberalism that Associates success with how much money you can spend that's a liberalism that brags about 11 billion do spent on 10,000 affordable units there's another kind of liberalism that brags not about how much you spend but about how much you build and that's a kind of liberalism that would say look how easy it was for us to BU 10,000 affordable units forget the price tag look how quickly we did it and look at the people who are now living there that's an outcome-based liberalism that I think is very different from the kind of progressivism that has become a habit on the left in the last few years yeah look how awesome are highspeed rails in California don't you want that Texas yeah well even just you know manufactured homes cost 30 to 50% less that are dropped on a piece of land as opposed to building on site I I think at some point in this longer conversation we got to talk about unions if we're going to talk about inefficiency but while I have you here I I I would be remiss not to ask you guys to find because I think you've done both have done really good podcasts on this it strikes me and this is a bit of a softball amongst three progressives that the exact opposite the Antichrist to an abundance culture are tariffs can you give me any sense for the rationale or any color you want to add on the current current obsession with tariffs across the current Administration Dereck I'll let you go first I think Donald Trump is a scarcity candidate I think his political success was created by a sense of scarcity a sense that America wasn't growing fast enough a sense that people couldn't afford what they wanted to afford whe whether it was groceries or housing what we've seen in the first few weeks the Donald Trump Administration is that he's using America's existing shortages to demand more deprivations he's saying Americans don't have enough housing and therefore we need fewer immigrants America doesn't have enough manufacturing and therefore we need higher tariffs which are essentially attacks on Imports right America doesn't have enough science that we think answers the kind of questions that we want and therefore we're going to gut scientific institutions entirely I think that's an approach to politics that essentially says we solve our problems of scarcity with just more scarcity and we're asking for the exact opposite we're asking for abundance we're saying yes there is an affordable housing crisis in this country and especially in many of the cities that people want to live let's get out of our way and solve this problem with Supply yes we agree with Secretary of Treasury besson's plan to increase total American energy production let's not hamper our ability to build solar wind and geothermal which are certainly the Energy Technologies of the Future Let's Get out of our way and make it easier to build those things as well and so I think tariffs are just a perfect just quintessentially example of the way that Donald Trump looks at the problems of American society today looks at the shortages and the scarcities and deprivations that we have and layers more scarcity on top of it that's his Instinct and in a way maybe I'm even giving him and his political uh habits even too much credit by sounding them any kind of ideological character I do think that personality explains everything that Donald Trump wants to do he's someone who likes to make big pronouncements make people feel like they're less than get on the phone work out a deal and so he likes a world where he threatens tariffs against the entire world and takes phone call after phone call after phone call from Individual world leaders to work out little deals between him and that leader to get something for himself and the people who support him right this is not in any capacity a strategy to make more for Americans who want more this is not a strategy that's going to do anything for housing certainly I mean the National Association of home builders I don't know if you saw this when you're putting together your newsletter the National Association of home builders came out with a message after the Tariff announcement that said this is going to be a catastrophe our inputs include lumber from Canada and drywall material from Mexico and now we're going to increase the taxes on those inputs by 25% this is a President Who understood his mandate which was all about unaffordability in this country to immediately raise the two key inputs of housing by 25% it's complete effing Madness like thinking about solving your problems by expanding Supply is so much more rational than whatever nonsense we're getting from the government right now can I read y'all JD Vance tweet that I've been really looking for an opportunity to tee off on but now maybe I have it J Vance tweets uh this was yesterday we're speaking on March 11th president Trump's economic policies are simple if you invest in and create jobs in America you'll be rewarded with lower regulations and reduce taxes but if you build outside of the United States you're on your own okay um so this toy model of the economy they have is such lunacy what if you're a uh restaurant and you've built your restaurant in the United States and you employ people locally to cook your food and serve your customers and clean your dishes but like most restaurants some percentage of the fruit and produce that you use is imported from Mexico so here you are investing locally creating American jobs and you were not having your taxes cut and your regulations cut you just had a large tax uh put on one of your main inputs which is food what if I happened to just like you know be in the kind of waiting room place and I don't know why I opened up wine spectator because I don't actually like wine but it had a alarmed editorial in wine spectator about how American wine wineries their biggest uh export Market is Canada and so here are these wineries they are growing their grapes in America they employ people in America to pick their grapes and make their wine and bottle their wine and Etc but because they want to sell to Canadians and Donald Trump is starting a trade war with Canada they are getting a big price and being made less competitive what if you're a machine uh a f what if you're a you make Advanced Machinery and a bunch of the input materials and intermediate materials you need are sourced in from Europe or from Japan but you do the Assembly of making this highly value added product here like are they helping you out no they're not because one uh like at the core of their politics is suspicion of the rest of the world it is suspicion of immigrants it is suspicion of other nations it is suspicion that trade can ever be positive sum that cooperation is something we should actually do that you are made Stronger by having beneficial interactions with each other in the way that Derrick said a minute ago that a lot with Trump comes down to personality there are people like JD Vance around him trying to Theory wash his intuitions but what Trump fundamentally doesn't understand is as much interpersonal as it is economic he's not a person who believes in cooperation he's a person who believes in dominance and he wants to run everything that way too and so he wants to dominate these other countries and close our border because at the absolute guttural level he thinks you're either winning or losing in every single interaction and that is not the way the economy works this is not the year 1210 ad like this is 2025 we have a complex global economy and we are on the Forefront of it racing ahead of Europe in productivity watching China fall behind where we thought they would be five years ago because we've been uh we've had plenty of failures along the way and plenty of people we didn't help out and plenty of things we didn't protect or invest enough in but there are tariffs their immigration policy and their whole General attitude and mental architecture that informs what they do doesn't actually make sense even when they try to explain it which is why I was doing a podcast on tariffs the other day it was the day after Donald Trump's big speech during the podcast they kept exempting things from their tariff policy while I was trying to explain their tariff policy Trump was at the speech the night before saying he had talked to the heads of the big three automakers and they were all thrilled and I'm literally talking about this in the podcast and my producers like uh they just Exempted Auto goods and then later in the show I'm talking about wasn't it Trump who did the usmca trade deal the US Mexico Canada trade deal in this first term said it was an amazing trade deal now the first thing he's doing is tariffs on Canada and Mexico what like what happened to his great trade deal couple hours later they're at least delaying tariffs on usmca Goods they haven't thought about this they haven't thought about the KnockOn effects they don't have a model of the economy that makes sense Steven Moran the head of the ca his paper which people are looking at is a holy Grill of what all this actually means he talks about a narrow path in this dense 41-page paper about how maybe all this goes perfectly and his whole theory is that you work with other countries in a way that they don't put retaliatory tariffs back on you if they do put retaliatory tariffs back on you then his whole Theory collapses it's already happening we're already off the Narrow Path they have not thought about this [ __ ] they're just breaking things we'll be right back we're back with more from Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson while I have you here you're both great communicators you're both strategists you understand positioning understand messaging what thoughts do you have so as a progressive I found that I was sort of flat-footed and just overwhelmed just sort of they're flooding The Zone with things that are meant to I think distract us enrage US male versus email Gulf of Cheaper eggs Dei causing helicopter crashes cuz I don't think they want us focused on the fact that they're about to increase the deficit by $800 billion a year to give guys like me a tax cut that were surrendering to a murderous autocrat I think they're saying look over here because they don't want to focus on the important things that are just sort of indefensible I'm curious what advice and this has probably already happened and Derek I'll let you go first Democratic party calls and says okay we really got to figure out our messaging and our strategy here and assuming that assuming that people understand that some of these policies are probably just economically ruinous I don't even think it's the tariffs are the most damaging thing I think it's our inconsistency you want to see what he's going to do around tariffs or Economic Policy look at who I had lunch with last and you can't you can't have a consistent when when no country knows who they're waking up next to they're they're remiss to do anything with you it's like well he could call this off tomorrow like there just no way to operate an economy much less a country what advice would you have for Democrats and the DNC uh who say are of like mind and think yeah we we need to take you know reuser government and constitutional Authority this economic plan is disastrous what strategy you're in the war room with James Carell right now advising 2026 uh congressional candidates and then 2028 what what strategies do you think we need to deploy Derek I think we lost two games in 2024 I think we lost a substantive game with afford and I think we lost an attention game this is definitely something that Ezra can speak to I would tell Democrats remember why we lost the 2024 election it was because a plurality of Americans said that they couldn't afford the life that they wanted they couldn't afford the good life and democrats should be absolutely laser focused on how to provide the good life for Americans and that means pointing out all of the lurid ways that Donald Trump is getting in the way I mean raise in tariffs while trying to build a manufacturing base is one of the craziest things I've ever heard I mean the worst thing you can possibly do when you're building a manufacturing base in any country is to make it impossible for domestic manufacturers to sell overseas the first thing you want to do if building an industrial base this is what South Korea did it's what Taiwan did is find a way to make it easier for your domestic companies to sell overseas not to get every overseas buyer to hate to so much that they retaliate their tariffs up to 50% so the first thing that I would say is remember why we lost we lost because of affordability how do we focus on affordability how do we give people a set of new answers on affordability and frankly I think our book does that it does that by shifting attention toward how do we solve these problems with Supply and especially how do we solve the mother of all affordability problems which is housing with Supply in many cases the good news here is that Donald Trump for all of his authoritarian power does not control housing policy in sanan Francisco he does not control housing policy in Boston he does not control housing policy in Los Angeles it is those cities run by those citizens and the people that they elect who control housing policy there which means that they have the ability to answer problems no matter what Donald Trump does focus on affordability the second big mistake that I think the Democrats made in 2024 and in the previous few years is I think that we've become afraid of talking to people who disagree with us there's been a kind of Purity culture that has come up on the left and sometimes you could argue it came up for good reason Democrats were fighting for causes that they found incredibly worthy and they didn't want those causes contaminated by Voices that they disagreed with but as a result I think it's created an insular character on the left that doesn't feel like it is extending an arm toward people in the center who agree with some of what we support but not everything that we support so I want to from a substitute standpoint absolutely Focus like a laser on the issue of affordability not only because it's the it's the number one reason why we just lost because I think it's going to be the number one cause of the 2020s and then number two I want us to have a different attitude toward reaching out to people who might disagree with us about things that even we find incredibly important I want us to be less embarrassed and less shy about talking to the center because ultimately it's not just about building a coalition that's 48% plus one ultimately what we want I think is to redefine what the Cambridge historian Gary gerol calls a political order a set of political and economic rules that doesn't just win two and foure elections but actually can last for decades the same way that the New Deal order lasted for decades and to do that you have to reach Way Beyond the 48% that's automatically going to vote for you in every quadral election you have to reach out to the 55 and the 60% and that requires not just a different kind of substantive Focus I think it requires a different theory of how to communicate I think that's pretty damn good I'll add very little to it uh two things one is that you have to take seriously that people don't like you you have to take seriously the Democratic party brand is trash I mean just look at it in the polling it's less popular than Donald Trump himself and Donald Trump is not a popular person or candidate so one thing you're going to have to do is deal with the fact that you've lost people's faith and the only way to gain it back is to show in some way or another you've changed in some way or another that you have rethought something and that gets to the second which is that the Democratic party is become over time it has become over time too internally coalitional too afraid of giving offense too afraid of disappointing any members of its Coalition its interest groups Donald Trump if he's proven anything it's it you can reshape what a party is about now he's done it autocratically but over time Donald Trump has substantially changed what the Republican party is on trade on immigration on Russia on Ukraine on National Security uh on whether it is important for your leaders to lead a decent Christian Life or whether you want like the god of the pagans Elon Musk with his as somebody put it 13ish children to be your standard bear alongside Donald Trump with his you know three marriages Etc and endless sexual harassment cases lawsuits reports so you can can change what you are when what you are currently in the case of Democratic party is a party that says it's of the working class and is losing workingclass voters whether now defined by income or education then you have to change right or you are not the thing you think you are and I think Democrats need to change and that means in public saying how the next generation of them is going to be different and what they have rethought and what they are not going to do the same next time as this time you are going to need resistance if I was in the room with James Carville I could not disagree with more of the James who I have tremendous respect for the Democrats should as he put in the times play dead and wait for the Trump Administration to collapse of its own weight I don't think that works I don't think it's leadership but they do need in addition to being a resistance to be an alternative and they need to admit the places where they failed as an alternative and then the next standard bear are the people competing to be the next standard Bearer need to show how they'll be different because they need to unlock the energy the attentional energy of creating some internal fights of making some people mad and so you see that you see that debate we're having and that I'm winning you know if you win it like that shows that if you vote for us this time you're getting something that you're going to like better or at least it's going to be different than what you got last time there is attentional energy and controversy Democrats have been too afraid of it I want to propose a thesis I have two questions and I'll let you guys go you've been generous of your time I think that we often times get focused on we study to the wrong test and I'm trying to think what is what is the goal what is the mission AI GDP productivity I think it's all a means to the ends but the ends are creating an operating system a platform an economy that enables people to have deep and meaningful relationships and the three of us I believe I'll have partners and are raising children and much to my surprise I have found that that has given me purpose and a sense of being and a sense of satisfaction that I didn't I didn't anticipate I wasn't planning to have children for me the if in theory of everything that should be we reverse engineer all of our public policy and economic decisions to one thing and that is people 18 to 40 should have the opportunities to meet each other mandatory national service more freshman classes more third places quite frankly more alcohol such that they can uh tax remote works one and three relationships begin at work such that um we have more people quite frankly having more sex falling in love and then have the economic wherewithal to have children Universal child tax credit prek minimum wage of $25 an hour uh quite frankly just stuff more money in their pockets such that we go back to where we were 40 years ago were 60% of 30-y olds have a kid versus 27% now I don't think it's because people don't like kids I think it's because they can't afford them but the unifying Theory of Everything is that any able-bodied American should at least have a reasonable chance that they will have the opportunity to meet somebody and the economic viability to have a family and that everything should be reverse engineered towards that opportunity for young people that that's the unifying Theory of Everything and should drive all of our economic and social policies your thoughts I wrote a cover story for the Atlantic called the antisocial Century where I said that maybe the most important social problem facing this country is that Americans spend a record amount of time alone and a record low amount of time in physical face Toof face cont tech and as I've continued to report out this story one of the more interesting parts of it actually relates incredibly deeply to housing if you take a look at sort of the life cycle of American aloneness teens have fewer friends teens hang out with their friends less 20 somethings dateless and then 30 somethings are less likely to get married 40 something less likely now to have children there's a kind of life cycle effect of this drawing back from interpersonal relationships which Scott I'm hearing you say is absolutely core to your vision of the good life I personally don't think that it is a political agenda's job to Define and inscribe The Good Life explicitly into people's lives I think it's the job of political agenda to build a platform a stage upon which people can make free choices that make them happy and the most important part of that platform and Stage that I think many young young people today are missing is affordable housing if you look at the share of young people who still live with their parents in their 20s and even early 30s it's higher than it's ever been outside of a recession it's very very hard to go on a successful date and get married when you're still living with your parents in your 20s and 30s and the reason that people are living with their parents in their 20s and 30s is not because they don't have the courage that people in the 1980s have or don't have the gumption that people in the 1990s have is they don't have the money that they need often to afford a place of their own in the cities where they want to live and a part of abundance I think that every great political movement has in America been a kind of redefinition of Freedom right the New Deal order was about defining the Four Freedoms of speech and belief from want from fear and then the 1980s Ronald Reagan created a new a new political order in this country that some call neoliberalism which redefine Freedom not freedom of but freedom from freedom from government in a way I think abundance is another redefinition of freedom and at the heart of that freedom is the freedom to live where you want to live because we have a rational housing market in this country that makes it affordable to have a place of your own in the place you want to live and I think if we had that I think if we had a reasonable Supply focused housing policy in this country you would have more young people people not living with their parents living alone starting what some call adulthood a little bit earlier having the confidence that their money goes further so they can afford better dates with whoever they want to date and therefore becoming more likely to get married to get married and have kids because as we know fertility rates tend to very commonly track coupling rates if you want a country with more kids you need to make it easier for young people to couple I think absolutely core to that is making it easier for people to live where they want to live and fundamentally is a housing story so the answer to your question is that it leads as so many things lead in our book in an American Life today it leads to housing I'd like to do a whole podcast with the two of you on this um I definitely agree with Derek that the answer to your question is that people should buy our book like that is clear um I think beyond that I'm probably more pessimistic than both of you are so I'm a left natalist the the leadup here that that you offered uh is mine too I think that family is I think children are important I am worried about falling fertility rates and I'm worried about them because of what it means about human flourishing not just what it means about society's replacing themselves I've done a bunch of podcasts on this I've done a bunch of reporting on this uh I really recommend the new Gideon Lewis Krauss piece on South Korea in the New Yorker from a couple weeks ago but look you can have the most from the liberal perspective pratal policy you can possibly imagine right that's Sweden Denmark their fertility rate is collaps too all their great parental leave and paid family leave and you know Universal prek and you know egalitarian tax system it didn't do it they're down at 1.1 I don't know that we know at least outside of policy interventions of a scale that nobody really wants to think about what we could do that would dramatically change that I think it's uh much it's cultural it's also technological in terms of you know birth control and fertility windows and and all the rest of it I'm not sure we know how to do it I do agree though that we could make the whole thing a hell of a lot easier I do agree that housing is a big part of that and economics are a big part of that and also I agree that culture is a big part of that and I think it matters that I think you see in JD Vance with his scolding of childless cat ladies I I sort of have this thing that comes from something the sort of conservative British feminist um Luis Perry said in a very wise interview where she she has this point that the difference between Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson is that Tate is a Pagan and Peterson is a Christian which I thought was interesting and it made me think about how you could cut the uh Trump Administration the same way like Elon Musk is a pagan JD Vance is a Christian that kind of thing but JD Vance's scolding of people was an effort to change culture right I think that's why he was doing it and also because he's become very resentful um I think the left has given up on having even any way to talk about what family structures it believes in I don't think you're going to be able to go back to the 50s the way some of these people think you will that includes people like Perry um I think you're have to imagine things that are new think I think that housing actually be a part of it but also in terms of experimenting more like I know a lot of people want to raise kids in coing situations it's extremely hard to figure out how you can collocate with your six best friends you know who are coupled and all raise your kids together I don't think it should be that hard I think we should make that a lot easier to experiment with we like the thing where we're raising all these kids in two working parent families are often one single parent family that's a huge experiment in human history that is not how we did it so making things that are a little bit more Clan based a little bit more communal possible again but you can't do it if 70% of the housing land in this country is own for a single family so I think you don't just need to make new things possible I think you need to make experimentation possible and I think culturally I I do think the left needs to figure out how to not just be so individualistic about this I I hear so many people talk about and they ask me about in my amas and stuff having kids like it's you know just a cost benefit analysis like taking a trip to Costa Rica I think there's something more valuable about that and it's not just about your life it is also about the degree to which we should cherish the existence and the gift of existence others get to have right the question of me having kids is not are my weekends Better or Worse their experience of the weekend is important in many ways more important than mine and so I I do think there's cultural Dimensions to this too that are not easily amendable to policy but but do require a a kind of set of discussions and a sense of what is the good life particularly in a a fairly secular age that you know Liberals are pretty uncomfortable having I'm not sure abundance the book solves all of that but it definitely solves enough of it that you should go check it out Ezra Kine is a New York Times columnist and the host of the Ezra Klein Show podcast previously he was the founder editor and Chief and then editor at large of Vox Derek Thompson is a staff writer at the Atlantic and the author of the work in progress newsletter he's also the author of The book's hitmakers and on work money meaning identity and the host of the podcast playing English their new book abundance is out now I said this off m i just admire you guys so much I think you're Fearless I think you're great storytellers just keep on keeping on gentlemen well done thank you man I appreciate it Scott thanks so much
