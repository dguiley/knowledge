# Gemini 2.0 blew me away The future of Multimodal Model

Published: 2025-03-18

Google just released Gemini 2.0 experimental model which is probably the first multimodel model that support both image understanding and generation you can upload image and give it a prompt the model will respond back not just text but also a generated image and we already seeing loads of wild examples from people where you can send image of model and image of close and ask it to combine into a new image you can even upload image like this and ask it to extract the passport photo of one of the person in the image in a high fality Manner and it even have accountability to generate multiple images in a row so that it can almost generate different frames within a animation or GIF and overall the image quality seems really promising but most importantly this experimental model is available VI the API and as we know gerini model's cost is extremely cheap compared with open Ai and Cloud which is around 96% cheaper than the GPD 40 model and we already seen people building some really interesting application like a AI native Photoshop where users can just upload image and just chat to the AI and ask it to update image for it or a gift maker where you can ask Gemini to generate multiple frames of a animation and putting together a gift and those are just the beginning that's why today I want to show you how can you utilize Gemini model to building some truly interesting use case and the example I will take you through is how did I use Gemini 2.0 experimental model and also connect to one 2.0 which is one most powerful image to video model they can generate really high quality videos based on image so that we can build some sort of commercial products for e-commerce site to Chad to Gemini to generate a p shot that they are happy with and then use 1 2.1 to generate quick P shots without further Ado let's get it firstly Let's test out how good Gemini 2.0 experiment Moto actually is so they do provide a few example use case and prompt some of them is like image editing where you can upload a image course song and ask it to adding some chocolate toppings as well as this visual story generator that you can ask Gemini to generate an actual story with the image for each SC but also want to try out some use case myself for I can upload this image and tell it to change the flag behind the man to USA flag awesome so you can see the result is actually extremely good even though when you're look into details some details face does change a little bit but it is majority the same and it is able to change just the spe flag and I can also give another try I upload this sketch and I give Pro mix this sketch into 3D render colorful style and it would be doing a pretty good job and I can continue promp it change the hair color to be red and make him smile okay so this part does look a bit weird or change back and then say don't change the face a lot but make him smile okay so this time it does looks a better cool I found that normally it does really high quality image generation at first shot and the more more turns you have in this chat lower the quality will be and in the end I also really want to try the gift use case so generate five frames of GIF in a 2D pixel games of a dragon monster cool so this looks really awesome except the last two image does look a little bit different but I'm pretty sure I can just change the prompt and make it consistent and you can pretty easily build application that just putting them together into a GI generator so here is enough test but overall what I found is that it does really good job in terms of image generation and keep the character consistent across different images but it performed less good when conversation became longer basically the more you prompt it the worst performance it get but overall really impressive and I can't totally see how this enable more people to be able to do image editing jobs and very likely people can build a new type of Photoshop or Cana experience with those real multimodal model abilities but the most interesting thing is let's try to use Gemini 2.0 API to create some prototypes so I just open up a new project cursor and let's first say add a EMV file to store the Gemini API key here and you can get API key on Google AI studio and let's create a Gemini experimental. py file and first they import a few libraries are going to use and then create a Gemini client and then I'll create a user prompt message so this is the type that you use to create a message history in gini and our pass this conversation history to the Gemini 2.0 model where the config here saying the response modality should be both text and image and we can probably expect this to extend to audio and video later and in the end depends on what type of response it return if the text will print out text but if the image we save this image file so let's give a try I will do python Gemini experimental. py all right so you can see that it generate an image of cat here so this how you can get Gemini 2.0 to generate image but what if if you want to pass a image response uh into gimini as well well what you can do is inside Parts here you can also add a types. part from bite and data equal to pass lip. pass generated image.png read bites and M type equal to image PNG and this should get the cat image we have here and then we can update prompt to make this cat hair like a red color and let's try again cool you can see the cast hair color turned into red color so this how you can utilize Gemini model to both read the image and also general image and next let's learn how can we turn this image into a video using one 2.1 model so we're going to use this 1 2.1 model host down replicate if you don't know what replicate is replicate is like the model marketplace where they have tons of latest AI models across image Generation video generation and lar L model itself you can either use those existing model models directly or you can find your own model with fairly limited amount of data set required and have a cloud service that you can call anytime so after you create a replicate account we can just click on this model they we're going to use which is 1 12.1 480p and we can click on API page and select Python and I will firstly add replicate token to mymv file here and then I'll create a new one going 2.1 and I can just copy this code example here the only difference is that here it is using a image URL but we actually want to rate a image from the local dis so I turn this into a function where it can open a local image pass on to this specific replicate model and save the video here and I can test it by running this function using this cat photo that we generated and give a prompt cat is looking around if you haven't installed replicate yet making sure to do the PIP install replicate and then we can round the script cool so you can see this a 5 Seconds video generated so we have both endpoint working the last thing we want to do is we'll create a quick web application using streamlet that can simulate the whole chat experience so our first create a general function for General response from Gemini we it detect if is first message that user try to send if it is then we'll attach the image user uploaded as part of cont as well as a promp and pend messages and generate to return the response meanwhile I will also turn the replicate model calling into this generate video function where it will try to call the replicate model and return the video pass when it's ready and also a helper function to reset the video state or also create a utility. py which has a bunch of utility function like save the binary file process upload image and check if the image are duplicated and in the end I use streamlit to quickly build a GUI and if you don't know what streamlit is it is a python framework that allow you to quickly build user interface and spin up a web app that you can share with other so I created app.py importing all the packages and the library that we have set a title and we will also Define list of state to keep track of what kind of message has been sent what image user has uploaded as well as image Gemini return and videos when 2.1 return now weer the title Define sidebar where users can upload list of image and we display the list of image and update State and then create two tabs with the tab one will be the chat experience where user can chat to Gemini to iterate the image and we'll have some logic here to display the chat history as well as logic after users click Send message and second tab for the video generation so all the image that Gemini return will be displayed for the user here for them to select and they can basically select image that they want to generate the video and once the video is generated we display the video here on the screen and once it finished I can quickly do streamlit Rong app.py and you can see here we have a web app that is ready to use I can upload some image I can promp it generate product shot of hand wearing the bracelet you can see here it generate a pretty good image of a man wearing this bracelet and I can also prompt it to say change the hand to be black man's head and now generate new image with a black man hand so you can see that users can use this chat interface to keep iterating the phoshop and if I go to video generation there are two image that I can use to generate video so I will select the second one give a prompt a p shot at showcasing the bracelet now get video generated so this is how you can build a example per using Gemini 2.0 API if you want to get more in depth about how to use this API and step-by-step process of reild the exact example I showcase here you can join the AI Builder Club Community and building
