# Morning Brew Founder 100B Bet AI

Alex Lieberman, founder of Morning Brew and current head of 10X, shares his journey of transitioning from a finance career to establishing an AI transformation firm and discusses the strategic considerations for embedding AI within business operations.

## Core Thesis
There is a pressing demand for AI transformation as businesses face pressure to integrate AI into their operations despite often lacking the understanding to do so effectively. Lieberman emphasizes the importance of combining strategy and execution to successfully map AI solutions to business challenges. 10X acts as both a strategic consultant and an executor, filling the gap traditional models leave by merely providing reports without follow-up action.

## Key Insights
- AI solutions need to be tailored to address specific business bottlenecks by combining consulting strategy with execution capabilities.
- The venture studio model poses challenges, particularly the "power law" phenomenon where the success of one venture overshadows others.
- An effective approach combines elements from different monetization and consulting models, ensuring both strategic alignment and financial sustainability.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Businesses should seek to establish a clear AI roadmap that aligns with their operational objectives.
2. Consider transitioning from traditional models to consultancy-based frameworks that ensure stable cash flow.
3. Continually evaluate the efficiency and scalability of different software solutions, prioritizing simplification and innovation.

## Notable Quotes
> "AI is the most fundamental technology change that's ever happened and it's really difficult to go through that change as a business."

> "We're treating this as a research lab partly as well for software opportunities."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
- Consider a blended model of consultancy and technology execution, particularly in AI, to deliver sustainable value.
- Foster an environment that supports innovation and collaboration among talented individuals for long-term organizational growth.
