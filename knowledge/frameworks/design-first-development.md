# Design-First Development

> As AI handles code generation, UX/design becomes the new bottleneck.

## The Shift

| Old World | New World |
|-----------|-----------|
| Coding is hard | Coding is commoditized |
| Design is nice-to-have | Design is the differentiator |
| Ship then polish | Design then ship |

## Why Design First

> "With the explosion of AI, it's becoming obvious that writing code is less and less of a bottleneck. So, what's the new bottleneck? Design."

AI can generate code from specs. But it can't:
- Invent aesthetics you didn't specify
- Know what "feels right" for your users
- Catch UX anti-patterns you don't see

## The Framework

### Before Any Code

1. **Design system** - Colors, typography, spacing, components
2. **Reference designs** - Screenshots, inspiration, anti-examples
3. **User flows** - What happens, in what order
4. **Aesthetic intention** - Not just "modern" but specific attributes

### The Design System Analogy

> "Building an app without a design system is kind of like trying to cook a five-star meal by just throwing random ingredients together."

Design systems provide:
- Consistent visual language
- Reusable patterns AI can reference
- Constraints that improve output

## Practical Application

```
1. Gather reference screenshots (5-10)
2. Define design system tokens (colors, spacing, type)
3. Create component inventory (what UI elements exist)
4. Document user flows (happy paths, edge cases)
5. THEN start AI-assisted development
```

### B. Related Concepts

- Structured context (design is context)
- User-centric planning (3-level pyramid)
- Vibe coding (works better with design constraints)
