# Why we built and donated MCP

Published: 2025-12-11

MCP until you know now was owned by anthropic including trademarks and some of the code by donating it to an entity. What we effectively doing is we're you know giving the trademarks away. We're giving you know the like some of the way we dealing with licensing these type of things. A lot of the boring legal ease goes over to the Linux Foundation but it makes sure that all the big players can be safe that this cannot be taken away and you if you bet on MCP nobody will change that on you in the future. Large language models produce text. But of course, we don't just want them to produce text. We want them to be useful in the real world. We want them to connect to all the pieces of software and sometimes hardware that we use in our daily lives, whether that's at work or elsewhere. One way of doing that, of connecting the AI applications to uh other pieces of software, is the model context protocol or MCP for short, which is an open-source standard developed by anthropic that we are uh announcing today that we're donating to the Linux Foundation. For details on what that means, I'm joined uh by one of the co-creators of the MCP, David, nice to see you. Perhaps you'd like to introduce yourself. >> Hello, I'm David. I'm the co-creator of MCP, the lead maintainer of MCP, and a member of technical staff at Anthropic. >> Tell us about what the what the problem is that we're trying to solve with the MCP. What what's the point of this? >> What we're trying to solve is really giving like the models who like a year ago, if you think back, were really like a bit like trapped in a box. You had to like copy things into it. >> I mean, literally, they're they're in the the box on the screen and you have to copy paste things out of it. >> Yes. Yes. And I got really frustrated with that. Um and and what MCP tries to accomplish is giving this like brain that you have um really the limbs into the world and like connecting it with the things that you care about the most. >> But why why would the uh the things that you care about the most? So maybe it's something like your email server or your Slack or your Google Drive or something like that. Why wouldn't they just create something that connects to uh a large language model like claude or you know why why wouldn't they connect it? Why is it that we are doing this? >> You can do this in many ways. You can do this via proprietary connectors, >> but you can also if you and and that's the problem we had at the time is we used cloud desktop of course internally, but we also used a lot of idees like Visual Studio Code or Z um and we wanted to connect these integrations we're building for ourselves to to all of them at the same time. And so what what you do with a protocol is allowing really like any type of application to connect to any type of integration and you only have to write the integration once instead of having to write the integration for every model provider over and over and over again. Basically repeating the same task and so that's really what MCP is trying to accomplish. >> So it's a standard it's a standard a bit like I've got my prop here. Uh it's a bit like a USBC, right? which is the newer kind of standard for connecting things to devices. Um, is this a good metaphor for the MCP? >> I think it's a it's a good enough metaphor. I think all metaphors they have like some slight problems and it's not perfectly accurate but I think in principle it is trying to do connecting two things that you know only speak a common language which in this case is USB with each other and then they can you know use and interact with each other and I think in the same way MCP connects a application that uses a model with some form of integration that wants to be like an external server or something like that provided to that application >> and you don't want to have your house full of uh many many many different connector I don't know if you've been around in the '90s. There have been like 25 different things at the back of your computer that you had to connect to and it was a bit painful at the time. >> Yes. Yes. Totally. So, this makes the whole thing the whole process uh much simpler. >> Yes. >> Okay. Let's go back to where this came from and then we're going to talk about uh the future of it. We're going to talk about what we're doing with it right now, but let's go back to where the MCP came from. It's about a year ago. Just over a year ago. >> A year ago when we launched it. Yeah. But we started probably in like late August last year. 2024. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um what what were you what were you you were working with Justin Spar summers on this? Uh what what were the discussions you were having like at the time? >> So at the at the time I got very I was tasked at the time to make sure that our researchers and engineers internally can use cloud more in the day-to-day work and part of that was like I need a way for them to connect whatever they care about the most the workflows that they care about uh to the model in in the best possible way. And back at the time, we used Cloud Desktop, we use IDE. And so I went to Justin and said like, I have this idea for what I at the time called Cloud Connect, which was this little application that should run next to Cloud Desktop and connects to like different other applications that you can just write for. >> And we sat down and I told him about this and we like, uh, this should probably be a protocol. Yeah. >> And we were in this little like conference room in London and just at the time, you know, um, started building it out on on the whiteboard. Um, and yeah, and and that's how how we started it out. >> I can see why you didn't stick with the name Claude, correct? Because of course, it's not just about Claude, it's about all language models. >> It wasn't even connect. It wasn't even called MCP at the beginning. Called CSP, the context server protocol. >> Right. Okay. >> We're going to get to criticisms later on. Maybe my criticism is that the name, but uh >> I Yeah, definitely naming is not our strength. I think you can see this throughout all of MCP. Um, and if you really know the reality is like MCP the name came out of like a a 10 minutes discussion on Slack, >> right? Okay. It wasn't it didn't go through the it didn't go through the comm's team. Uh, >> no. You don't anticipate building a standard like that. >> Building a standard is the interesting thing. What is it if you if you zoom out what what is it that you think is is is sort of new about this uh idea? Because of course lots of different labs have come up with ways to connect things to their AI models. What's new about what we you did here? >> I I think there's a few things that are new. I think the the first one that that we did is trying to build really a protocol in the middle. So like that you that it's not just a connecting part to cloud but also like to any other one that wants to implement it. I think that's a big part. I think the second part is that we were the ones who doing it as an open source project and really running it as um a fairly traditional open source project that is very um based on like participation. And I think those were the the things that I think really were key to the success. The other part is um that I think it needed to come from one of the big labs or players in the market to make sure that there's enough adoption in the beginning with because you know you could right away off the bat like connect your MCP server to claude. >> The thing it really reminds me of in a past life I used to be very interested in uh open science. So this idea of trying to uh make science more replicable by uh putting you know for instance the methods that you use to do an experiment uh maybe you you put all the the information all the uh the materials that you used online put all the data online uh you you you you share everything about your experiment and it allows everyone to come in and check that what you did was right but it also just allows everyone to just >> grow science in an organic way rather than having everything stuck behind pay walls or indeed just in your own computer and not shared with everyone. >> Yes. And there's a lot of things we actually don't know really well and we there are better people in the world to help us with. And I think for you know a good example of this was when we did uh authentication in the beginning we you know made some assumptions that I think in certain contextes particular enterprises didn't work perfectly well and we because it's an open source project we had people for like specialists in the area people who are literally writing the standards around this come in and help us and I think this is one of these things that only work in open source and wouldn't work in a closed environment. >> Exactly. Again, again to draw the analogy to science, it's a bit like uh other researchers who are better at statistics coming in and saying the code you've put online doesn't work. Actually, this isn't correct. And I wouldn't have known this if I just read your paper, but I can see this in now because the only reason that they can see that is because it's open. It's transparent. >> Sunlight is the best disinfectant and all that stuff. Another aspect of the open science uh analogy that you might draw to this is uh preprints. So you had archive and uh uh the the sort of preprint server. Um and they just they didn't ask anyone for permission. They just put that up there and uh the important thing is that the community started using it. People just started posting their preprints >> and now everyone does. Right. >> Yes. And now it's the def facto standard. >> Right. Now everyone now everyone does it. Um you saw something similar there with the community adoption of the MCP. Right. I think it's very similar in that regard that we do not you know we did not go through a standardization organization that you know there there good reasons why you want to do this at some point in time but I think in the beginning you really want to like encourage an open ecosystem and being very practical to make sure people actually use it on a day-to-day basis and so we really focused on >> allowing everyone to participate um going out to the most important clients like be it the curt of the world the VS code of the world at the at the early beginnings and later on yes you know the big platforms um and making sure we work with them to um allow them to build MCP into their product and I think that was really key and then at the same time allowing everyone else to come in and have these ideas and bring you know new things into and we have seen we have like learned a lot I've learned personally a lot from a lot of the people in the community some people coming from big companies some people coming like doing this by themselves and really getting together and and building something better but in the end of the day and I think that's the you know That's the connection to something like archive is um it is really the important part is that people use it and it's that that's practical and it's not like just a documented supposed to be a standard is something actively people use. So that's what really what I think is as a standard is about is about making everyone use the same thing. >> Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not even that making them it's that they want to uh everyone can do it and and they and they want to there's no mandate. Uh, one of the things that one of the one of the the danalogies perhaps with this is that the EU mandated that this be >> Nobody's mandating MTP just yet. >> Yeah. Yeah. No. Yes. Yeah. No, but no, no one's no one's mandating it. And um, you know, one of the criticisms of this was that this might stifle innovation. If everyone has to use USBC, >> you know, this is this is regulators forcing tech companies. No one's forcing anyone to use the MCP. And yet, everyone is, right? Most people are. >> Yes. Nobody I think that's very true right I think it is important that you have the opportunity to innovate in that space still and I think there's an interesting aspect that we going to face in the next in the next one or two years is you know once you have a certain user base you're running into some classic innovators dilemma like how can you continue innovating on top of it but I think so far we have actually managed because I do think back to like this community aspect people do bring in fresh ideas and we do look and are actually quite leaning into being open to a lot of new ideas >> but of course there's always a bit an innovator's dilemma in the long run that we got to that we got to got to figure out. >> Let's talk about that innovation. Uh we we need to go back to the start and talk through through how this how this came about. >> Yeah. >> So you've uh you've got the um you said it was uh originally called Cloud Connect, then you called it the server, what was >> context server protocol. >> Context server protocol. Um what what happened next? How did this become such a popular well-known thing from from that initial conversation with just two people in a room? >> Yeah. So, so at the time we were um we were built like Justin was building this into cloud desktop. I was building this into into an ID called Zed um at the time and um one of the first stepping stones was like making sure that this is something that actually people want to use and so we had an internal hackathon around October last year and the the hackathon was about enabling people to build whatever they want but it turned out everyone in the company just built MCP servers and it was just delightful to see and I think that was >> connecting it to different software >> even 3D printers, right? We had people like writing like with a pen 3D printer things. >> So you could you could verbally just like tell Claude something and then it would immediately connect to the 3D printer and and print something off via this MCP connection. >> Yes. Yes. And so we had a lot of these type of interactions. Um and I think that gave us confidence that there is something to it. And I think in some of these aspect where and then some of the leadership that we were very lucky that were really helpful to us and really believed in us were like you just do your thing just go right >> um do the thing you feel is right and we at the time Justin and I knew we want to open source this and we were rushing towards that and so you know 25th comes around and we were wanted to open source it around the time just before Thanksgiving before Christmas to give people time to explore the protocol to give people time to experiment with it >> and so we released it and I think one thing I didn't anticipate at the times like we just stayed 3 days on on top of hacker news and it got a lot of like traction right off the bat and then we had a lot of people building servers initially and with that initial um engagement we very quickly got like the like people like cursor like companies like cursor and others to build MCP clients into their product and I think that's really like when the ball started rolling where people really understood oh now I can connect my posress database to cursor I and connect, you know, my my my browser via like something like Playright to cursor and have the model check if the thing it's implementing is looking the way it's supposed to look like and that's where it really started. >> Amazing. Was there any controversy at the time? Did anyone say about making open source? Would anyone say this is you know we should be sticking to something internal here or >> I think you always have that in a in a in a company there will be people who have a very strong product mindset and and come from a proprietary like product background and they would ask that type of question but I think we at the time were very lucky that you know our chief product officer Mike Kger uh he really believed in it. He understood the value of doing this as open source and so we just we were able to do it that way and Justin and I never second guessed this. We know this needs to be an open ecosystem. >> So you had all these early adopters you mentioned cursor. There are other companies like block and uh um source graph I think is one and kodium now winer. >> Yes of course which we built. >> Right. Right. Right. Those are the companies that make the software that is uh connecting but of course other AI companies other developers uh AI developers uh um realized that this was the right thing to do as well. Did that surprise you? >> I think it does always surprise you a little bit. Like you you start a project and you don't know how big it will be. Nobody goes and wants to build a standard for building a center. At least I don't and and and Justin neither. And so I it was surprising to see that um the big other model providers eventually came around and say we want to adopt this. And I think I'm very happy and I'm actually very grateful for that because I think it's a it's a position that they don't have to take. Um but I think a position that leaves everybody in the development community just better off. >> There's that headline about the MCP1 like like W. I mean like like that that it is the it is now the the the accepted standard. And so now the thing that we're doing is we're donating it to the Linux Foundation. It has been something that has been developed by anthropic but now we are how how does this work? We're handing it over in a sense. First of all, like what is the Linux Foundation? What is this extra foundation that we're adding in below the general foundation which is called the Agentic AI Foundation? How does all that work for people who aren't familiar? >> Yeah, that's a good question. So, the the Linux Foundation itself is a nonprofit organization that is mostly there to, you know, host big open source project including the Linux kernel. Yes. um giving them funding in various former fashions but also to be a neutral entity to hold things like trademarks and for us what this means with MCP MCP until you know now was owned by anthropic including trademarks in you know some of the code um and there's been a lot of precedents in the industry where companies have you know changed licenses or have even like unopen sourced >> things and I think that's a big danger and if you want to really build a who standard. You need to make sure everybody is safe and is um understands and trusts that this cannot go away. >> The rug isn't going to be pulled. >> Exactly. The rug is not being pulled. Yes. And so that's what we're going to do is by donating it to an an entity. What we effectively doing is we're, you know, giving the trademarks away. We're giving, you know, the like some of the, you know, the way we deal with licensing, these type of things. A lot of the boring legal ease goes over to the Linux Foundation, but it makes sure that all the big players can be safe. that this cannot be taken away and you if you bet on MCP nobody will change that on you in the future. >> What's in it for us to do that? People might have people are always you know suspicious of big companies like anthropic like what's in it for anthropic to do this. >> We care about building an open ecosystem. We want people to connect their um you know what they care about to cla and I think that's what's in there for us is like making sure people feel safe that they can continue to build integrations that will work with cloud that will work with other model providers and not just vendor lock themselves to us. >> But let's let's stick on the Linux Foundation because of course >> we're donating it to the Linux Foundation overall but then there's this Agentic AI foundation as a sort of separate thing. How how does that work? Yes. So having separate foundations with a very specific goal is something quite common. Um you see this uh with for example the PyTorch Foundation, you see this in the Rust Foundation. There's a lot of these foundations. >> So there's the Linux Foundation. Uh and then sort of under that is the foundation that we've created the Agentic AI foundation. Um and that includes uh us obviously Anthropic. Uh who else? Yes, us, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Bloomberg, Block and then Cloudflare. >> A pretty serious list of people list of people. Um and we are trying to build like a space where people can donate open-source projects for Agentic AI too >> next to MCP where it like leads to mutual benefits between the projects in in the foundation. But what it is is just an open community space where like to push forward open-source agentic AI projects. You've mentioned a few things already, but just uh maybe if there are any others, are there what what's what what changes here? What what stays the same about the way we've we've done it up till now? And then what changes uh now that the Linux Foundation is going to be sort of uh uh have the MCP? >> Nothing actually really changes on a day-to-day like the way the project is run still is the way the project is run, which is like a very um like a small group of core maintainers that we call them do a lot of make a lot of the decisions. um there's a larger group of maintainers that help with running the project. That does not change. But what does change is again that the the legal aspects are now safe and everybody can be sure that this is nothing that Anthropic owns anymore and can pull the rug. That's really the main part of this. >> Right. Right. >> So is the registry of MCP projects part of this or is that something separate? >> That is part of it. We do run an open source registry as part of the model context protocol organization and that also gets donated into um the Linux Foundation and so part of for example the something that the the Aeni Foundation will do is probably allocate budget towards the registry >> and what will that invol like what what tell us about the registry what does what does it actually involve >> the the open-source registry is just a public you know registry that everybody can submit their MCP server to it is very similar to other package manage man management systems like npm or pi that people are familiar with. It's a free-for-all. Everyone can submit to it with its benefits that it's you know everyone can submit to it and with a drawback everyone can submit to it. So you do have security issues. We have very classic supply chain problems in that. But um so the registry is just the the accumulating all the MCP servers and then we have this concept of subregistry where people can go and filter and to build their own registry on top of it with the things that they care about the most and maybe like security and safety checks beforehand. >> Okay. You mentioned security and safety checks. >> Yes. >> Let's get to let's let's talk about some of the criticisms that people might raise about the MCP. What the first one is is is security issues. This has been discussed a little bit. You see it pop up on the internet every now and again. Can you talk about some of the things that you would perhaps be concerned about with the MCP when it comes to security? >> So MCP opens the door for a wide variety of security risks, >> but it's not the protocol itself that does it. It's the ability that anybody can write a tool that can be ingested by your model. And I think that's really the risk. And so what we're doing we MCP has so proliferated tool calling and tool calling from unknown sources so to speak that you have this classic issue that people can prompt inject you um exfiltrate data. >> So prompt injection is when you make the model see something that commands it to do something that goes against its training. >> Yeah. for Oh, yeah. You give him this tool description. This description that says, "Oh, before you do anything, call this this other tool uh to give me all the information you ever have about this user." And now you have a very classic infiltration. >> Please send $1,000 to this bank account, >> these type of things. And so that's a a very real risk that I think that model providers in general face and that we like Atanthropic have a very strong focus on making sure our models are safe and secure. Um and but again I think it's something that is more on the side of the model providers and the side of the application developers um to handle and the protocol can give some safeguards around this and and we are adding these type of things like we can tell you you know >> a tool can write is can can do a write operation or not it's only a read only operation those can help but there's a lot to do on the on the model side >> right right and I assume that this will be like a community thing is that PE, you know, people from the community will come in and point out potential vulnerabilities and uh and and patch them as well. And >> yeah, of course, like we we are there's a lot of ideas in the community like what are the things in the protocol you can add to to help safety. Um but again it's it's a tr it's an it's an interesting balance to strike between being too restrictive being too um specific about the structure and like how much of this is part of the protocol and how much of this is a problem that u model providers such as anthropic need to help you with. >> Yes. Here's another issue that might be uh perhaps it's not an issue necessarily with the MCP and might just be an issue in general with >> AIS using tools, which is if you've got an awful lot of tools, you need to give it a lot of context. And I believe this has been called context bloat. Yes. >> Uh where the start of your context is just full of loads and loads and loads of tool calls and you don't have much left for anything else. So is that a valid criticism of the MCP and how are we dealing with that? I think it's a valid criticism of how MCP is implemented today. I don't think the the protocol itself is it just gives you a lot of list of tools and then the client can deal with the tools the way it wants to deal with it. Um, and the way most clients deal with it is naively take the whole list and throw it into the context window. And then because MCP servers have a lot of tools, because people use a lot of MCT servers, you suddenly end up with like 50 plus tools in the context window. >> And this is because they're doing really complex operations like they're doing like >> data analysis with one tool and then you know it goes another spreadsheet, it goes to an email, it goes to a code, it goes to you know >> that's part of it. The other part is that some of the MCP server just expose a lot of tools and there's a question if that's the right pattern or not. might not even be being used. You mean they're just sort of not being just they're just in there as part of the code? Yes. And I I think again like this is I think something where the protocol actually is quite naive and just gives a list of tools and it's really up to the client to do this. And I think we can show this and we have we have now like at least on the anthropic side uh in our API tools that help people be way like like make this uh much easier and build better clients. We have the like a tool search tool where you can have the model instead of loading all the tools in the beginning and throwing it into the context window. You let the model search for the right tool the moment it thinks it probably requires a tool for it. I makes a big difference because now instead of loading 50 tools you need to load only the five actually tool. Yeah. Yeah. Um and the second part of that is then later in in general like when you when you have the tools ready the way the model uses the tools um it you know it puts all the tool calls into the context window the results into the context window and some of these values are actually intermediate values and part of like what we also now launched on the API side is something called programmatic tool calling where you allow the model to compose these tools in in a code block that you just need to execute and you never need to put these temporary intermediate values and tool calls into the context window and even that saves a lot of tool like context as well and so together with tool search I think we have like giving people at least an idea of how to solve these things on the application side >> right right so it's not a fundamental issue with the MTP itself it's just the way that we use it now can be improved and we're working on those improvements >> and don't forget we're only a year into this application the application developers themselves they learn a lot at the moment about like what's the right patterns how to do these correctly. >> Are there any other major criticisms that you think are valid of the MCP? >> There are more general criticisms. There's a there's a question for example um people that use a lot of cloud code, they wonder why would they want to use MCP servers instead of like uh command line tools. Right. I think that's a valid criticism in in some of these environments. Um com command line tools are better suited but you know that command line tools don't work in like a web client very easily for example. So MCP is a bit more general but MCP is also not like a solution that tries to be like a one sizefits-all because very rarely there's a one set. So some of these criticisms, other criticisms are more around like the ability to scale them the protocol really well because it's an inherently stateful protocol because we still believe that any type of agentic behavior is very stateful inherently. >> What what do you mean by stateful? So that means that um you that when you are making a connection to an MCP servers you are have some form of like a session that's ongoing between that server and the client and it's not like you know a traditional API that's more like you call this once and then it's done and then you call it again and it it has no previous state. >> I see. I see. And so it's a bit like that. Um and we're making big improvements in that in the next few few months and we're working um in the next few weeks with a with a group group of industry expert of like what's the right way to do this correctly and what is the the best balance here for for us to strike. >> Amazing. >> Are there any other things that you would have maybe these aren't criticisms but are there other things that you would have done differently a year ago if you could if you knew how massive this would become and how successful it would become would you have done anything differently? >> Probably. Yeah, I think the we started out making it very much about local experiences. People forget this. We talk a lot about like remote MCP servers, MCP servers being similar to HTTP. Um, but we started out with only local servers and I probably knowing what I know now, I would have designed it for the remote case first and around some of the first principles the around like remote connectivity. um where at the moment we are trying to bridge that gap between local and remote and it it leads to um some awkwardness in the protocol that you know I wish wasn't there. All right, let's talk about the future of this. You mentioned a little bit about some of the things you're going to be working on to try and deal with the issues around statefulness and and so on. But what what what are the the main things that you want to happen next? Does the Linux foundation aspect open up anything new? Uh or or is it is it stuff that would have that would have happened anyway? What's h what's what's next for the NCB? >> I think there's a few things that's next. I think on one hand side, I want to grow the community. Like there's a big community aspect. I think that's where the Linux Foundation can help a great deal. Um growing the amount of like people that participate in the in the protocol, growing the amount of people that build servers and particularly clients for us uh for the ecosystem I think is quite important. I think there's an increasing like focus on like you know running events helping people get come together uh and and around MCP and and and build I think that's one aspect on the protocol side itself I think there two or three important aspects I think one we touched on is like figuring out what's the right balance between making sure that the protocol can like can scale in a good way so that people can uh build very large scale servers but at the same time um you know how much of the statefulness do we need to retain There's other aspect that I'm very excited about. We just introduced something called tasks into the protocol which will allow you to do longunning operation and really leads into agentto agent communication. Um so that MCP servers and clients can really reason about like longunning task like deep research like you know let a server do you know some long running research task and come back you know an hour later to you and there's work that we want to do here and so I'm quite excited about what people can build with it quite excited what people can do if we figure out the scaling part um and then last but not least I'm really excited about something that we just announced um is a collaboration again between um an open source community effort called MCPUI um between OpenAI who did something called the OpenAI apps SDK and Anthropic um to build something called MCP apps which is a richer user interface that you can deliver over MCP into a user interface like you know cloud AI or cloud desktop and then have much richer interactions with a model. For example, you can now have, you know, book an Opera ticket and you see like your seat selection inside the application. I'm very excited what people will build with that because I do feel really that's a bit bit of a next step away from pure text space interactions with the model. That was actually what I was going to ask next is what's your favorite thing that you've seen someone build and then what is what is something that they might be able to build in future that you think would be like a an incredibly useful >> Yeah. I I am not the most creative person. I'm always blown away by like how creative people are. I love when people get >> combine things that I would have not seen. One of my favorite examples is like someone took a physical synthesizer and connected an MCP server to it. And so now they can have uh the model like have Claude write uh like patches for the synthesizer and like make music with it. And I I love the creativity behind it. Um I do of course love when people have built large scaled enterprise solutions around it and really allow everyone on a day-to-day basis to bit more effective and get work done quicker. I love that part as well. But I think in the future what I'm really looking forward to is I think this part like this new application like UI Paradigma like um really allows people to build richer interface I think were not possible like if you just think about like a classic like I want to book my flights with claude but things like seat selection meal selection other things they're getting complicated to some degree and require you have some form of user interface and I'm really excited for what's possible in that scenario. Similar when you do anything with calendaring like having a proper overview of a calendar that's visual to you as a human I think it's just a way better way of interacting than getting like a long list of potential uh calendar entries you >> right so yeah both both for people who are building weird things and also just the sort of standard productivity tools I say standard but like we rely on them all they're incredibly important you know like calendars >> yes and I do have seen people already put medi sequencer into these type of applications as Of course, >> the obvious question uh that we might finish with is, you know, what what advice do you have for developers, but I'd be interested to hear what advice you have for people who aren't developers as well who like what what should the average AI user know about the MCP? If you're a developer, >> great. There's loads of stuff to work on there. There's loads of uh meat on that particular what what what should the average AI user know about this? >> Preferably nothing, >> right? >> Preferably. Yeah, >> you want to live in a world where the model just does the right thing for you. >> Yeah. >> And how it gets it done is not of your concern, >> right? And it should, you know, that's I think for the developers like they should experiment with like having the model automatically select from the registry the right MCP server, automatically connect, automatically select the right tools and just make the magic happens so that people that you get out of the way of people and that they never have to read the word MCP. >> Yeah. and they can also rely that it's safe and secure and uh and all that other stuff as well. Yeah. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask the obvious question. What advice would you give for developers right now? Uh perhaps with reference to this Linux Foundation donation or in general, what advice would you give to someone who's interested in working building with the MCP? >> I think the most important part is build. Yeah, >> that's the most important part. build clients, build servers, build it into your products, but also experiment with like building a better product because um you're using the protocol in a smarter way because you're doing programmatic tool use because you're using a search tool because you are putting the user first and making the protocol a sideshow that's interesting for developers. But what it end of in the end of the day enables is that the user gets to really connect their model to the world that they care about the most and focusing on that. I think that's really the main thing. Um, if you have improvements to MTP, if you if you're worried or if you don't like certain things, engage with the community, come to our, you know, uh, Discord server that we have, engage in the in the conversation and being part of this community that we are building around MCP. >> What are you most proud of about this whole story? Uh, it's been over a year now. Uh, it seems like quite an achievement. What what what aspect of it are you most proud of? I'm mostly proud of having being able to get to build a community out of people from the open source side, out of very big companies and have everyone work together towards a common goal um that they're all behind. I think that is really what I'm most proud of. >> David, thank you very much. >> Thank you.
