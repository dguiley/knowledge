I got to ask what what do you make of the Republican ble by Senator [Music] Brit I go on I was stunned well it was like the Democrats night we thought it couldn't get better and then Katie brick comes on I was like this is this heaven have I gotten there um am I about to defend my life with Albert Brooks up [Music] here Jess where does this podcast find you um I'm home in New York nice uh so let's bust right into it it's been a week since Biden State of the Union what have been your biggest takeaways not only in terms of the talk but the reaction to it I guess the biggest takeaway is how hungry the American public was for Biden to seem like he can do the job like everyone was kind of waiting with baited breath for will there be this moment that could put you know as reclines concerns aside and a lot of their own concerns about his age and his mental Fitness and you're asking a lot of someone at that in that age bracket I know you've talked about this before to give you five more years of the hardest job on the planet and I think there was this Collective sigh of relief we've seen a little bit of a bump in the polling from it but more just everyone's psyche is a little bit lighter about it uh when you talk to people they're like okay we can do this yeah it feels like he spoke with a Vigor and a strength that's totally Unbecoming and 81y old I mean just just uh just just while you said on the five that you you know the address went well because quote the Republicans would have used the age attack and are now basically saying that he's an aggressive uh partisan what leg do you think or what will be the Republican go-to now I think that they'll continue with he doesn't have the temperament for it so we'll switch from that like he vacillates between old man and old man you know get off my law they're calling him like Old Yeller for instance I've I've heard tossed around we'll get a little more of this uh does he take Aderall some people going so far as the co the cocaine bag in the White House was actually his um Aderall is completely legal if he is taking Aderall I really don't mind um at this point but I think that they'll and we'll see the Fallout from special counsil her's testimony um which is going on about Biden holding classified documents and that he didn't charge him because he's a a nice elderly man or something like that and people will play around with that but above all else I feel like they won't go to the issues which is really where they have the highest chance to win and that's where Democrats can make up a lot of ground by just focusing on that for the moment so you actually have a background in dating Consulting and I want to see if you agree with the CIS and then ask you a specific question my thesis is the national polls especially now are literally meaning meanless that they're fun to look at but they just mean almost nothing if you look at you know I think Herman Kane was polling at the top of this point 12 or 16 years ago it kind of comes down to five states have you done any research or do you have any thoughts around what is or is not happening in those actually small number of counties in those swing States not necessarily on the county level I think it's a little early for that but definitely it's kind of five to seven states that decide all of it and you know how important it is from where everyone is going for their early campaign stops right like they're showing up in Pennsylvania they're showing up in Georgia they're showing up in Wisconsin um they're raising money in New York and California but we're really only good for dollars right um otherwise if you want to be persuadable you're going to the place where there actually are persuadable voters um in terms of focus let's say on the big cities that shows the Democrats are concerned as always with turning out their base what will black voters do what will Latino voters do what will young voters do um and Donald Trump is holding his campaigns in more rural areas for instance where his voters tend to be so you can see the beginnings of it but I wouldn't say that the polls are totally meaningless because trend lines matter right like we look back to 2020 and a lot of the kind of big honcho pollsters like the Nate cones of the world the Nate Silvers of the world have been referencing the fact that Biden never trailed Trump in 2020 so we are seeing a little bit of a difference in in terms of how the electorate is responding to these two four years later and I think that that is Meaningful because you need to change your behavior as a result of it it doesn't mean Joe Biden's going to lose but if you see enough polling that says for instance he's a little soft with X demographic like black men for instance is something that always comes up black women no problem they're showing up they're jazzed about it they're ready to vote for Biden Harris black men there have been all of these quote Barber Shop tours Focus Group um where they're hearing like I don't know what has he really done for me kind of the Charlemagne the God argument which basically says Donald Trump is an insurrectionist I'm not interested in that but I really want to see the brass tax of what Biden has delivered and so you know because that's showing up in this early polling that that's a soft area for you and you've got to pay attention so that's where I think that it's meaningful just like a snapshot of time you know mid-march these are our issues mid April these are are issues miday ETC and then you hope by September October that you don't have those issues anymore let's talk a little bit about demographics uh my sense is I mean we take for granted we think that the nation is a static organism and it isn't the populace and the nation has changed since 2016 a lot of people have died and there's a lot of new voters and my sense is and again I just might be talking my own book or you know engaging in confirmation bias but does don't the demographic shifts favor Biden and that the people who died are mostly older white mostly conservatives whereas the new voters are going to be mostly nonwhite and lean left don't the demographics foot well to Biden right now they definitely do if everyone is engaged I mean it sound it's like the stupid trism about elections you know it should go this way if everybody turns out but we know that that's the biggest threat certainly that the Democrats are facing KLA Harris gave an interview a couple weeks ago where she said we're not really Afra of Donald Trump were afraid of the couch right that it's bad weather that day and you're just going to sit at home I was in Iowa for the caucus um was it like a month ago a month and a half ago and it was the coldest day in I don't know 50 years they had really low turnout now it didn't matter on the Democratic side it really only mattered for Republicans who are actually having a competition but you saw a really depressed turnout as a result of that but overall yes about the demographics but we are seeing this uptick in a little bit of conservativism especially like if you look at an issue an issue like Israel Hamas which we've talked about before um where you can see minority voters leaning a bit more to the right than you would expect or that I would like and that's something that the Democrats really need to work on catering to and what so you're advising they say right Jess you're datadriven smart pragmatic we want you to advise us on the two or three core messages of our platform do that for the Republican party right now do that you're a Hired Gun I mean even with the billion billion half bucks each each party is going to raise for the presidential race they have finite capital and they have to zero in on a couple messages what do you think those messages are for each of the candidates I think for the Democrats and I hate to say this because it's such an important issue and one that really matters to me I think we really got to wa get away from talking about saving democracy that January 6th isn't something that works for people any more that's kind of baked in that they think it was an Insurrection attempted coup Etc and you have to talk about these frankly really boring things um my friends run a very cool polling firm called slingshot strategies and they're doing all this work for Reed Hoffman and they've found that talking about things like preserving Social Security and Medicare um you know creating good jobs protecting a woman's right to choose bodily autonomy that's really what you have to be talking about and if you are not focused on issues that matter for everyday people like it's a privilege to sit around saying like oh do you do you remember this exact detail of what happened on January 6th or can you believe Trump said this at a rally people real people glaze over right they're still in the phase where they know that their prices are a bit up um they're going down they're going in the right direction but I said the other day you know having a campaign slogan of we've had the best recovery in the G7 it's just not sexy right no is putting that on a bumper sticker um so the real brass tax kind of stuff again the entitlements are huge um not just for older voters but matter to younger voters it's interesting also how much the debt and deficit um ranks as important things that people want to talk about no one actually wants to reain them in but people love to hear that kind of stuff so I would like a campaign that was pretty boring entitlement reform you know or protecting entitlements or or ensuring you know they always couch entitlement reform and let's put in a lock box and make sure that it's around for a long time at the same time you know we're spending 6 and a half trillion OR7 trillion doll a year when we have five trillion receipts so people are concerned about debt and deficit yet the two don't square up right do you do you think that you these are talking points or do you think that the nation is ready for the hard truth about uh do we need to raise taxes or cut cut entitlements the answer is yes I mean all Road lead to the same place with this level of deficit spending do you think that the public is ready for that type of uh you know straight talk or it's more just jazz hands talk about the debt but also say we we need to save Social Security to me those are just diametrically opposed it's interesting they're ready to talk about it when they're pulled on it so my old boss actually did a ton of work uh for the Simpson Bulls commission which was probably the most sensible commission that we've had in decades and people are willing to give a little if it means saving on the other side right they are genuinely concerned about the debt and the deficit understand there has to be some personal sacrifice whether that's means testing for instance or just rich people saying like I should forgo this there's no reason that I should get a couple thousand dollar from the government when I live in Malibu and everything is great for instance um that does not work in an election it's like all morals go flying out the door and voters then don't want to hear it it's a very select group that can continue to have these very sensible conversations when they're actually picking their candidates um so you are completely correct and it will never change in an election year uh that people want to hear like nothing will ever be taken away from you and you know if we have to print more money it's worth it and stimulus is the way to go and the Biden Administration has a pretty strong argument for it actually that the investment in the country has benefited us and now do Republicans well the messaging that they are going to go with is definitely this border security issue which is the number one issue now across the board and for a lot of Independence I was surprised to see how many Nikki Haley voters um so kind of moderate Republicans and independents uh were into that same thing happened in 2018 remember when the Caravans first came around um and then they miraculously disappeared the day after the election I don't know how that's uh that's feasible but they're going to go and they probably should for what their base wants talk about border security and crime and policing and then the economy the problem is with the economy is that they're really struggling to make the metrics work for them right now and a lot of Republicans who are maybe being more honest about it like even Larry cudow who worked in the Trump Administration has given some of the more enthusiastic two thumbs up uh for what we're seeing in terms of the economy with job reports with wage growth fighting back inflation Etc um so I think it's a difficult Road I think for them they need to stay away though from all social issues they can't even touch them if they're not willing to revise their platform and say things like climate change is real or maybe kids don't deserve to die while they're sitting in a classroom or maybe uh heartbeat bills are a little archaic or ridiculous they're going to get pummeled I got to ask what what do you make of the Republican bual by senator I go on I was stunned well it was like the Democrats night we thought it couldn't get better and then Katie brick comes on first of all we see you we hear you and we stand with you I was like this is this heaven have I gotten there um am I about to defend my life with Albert Brooks up here um I I don't understand cuz she's actually very competent and very smart I've seen her give a bunch of interviews she's Charming she's exactly what the Republican party needs right like uh she's 42 I think has two kids she's married to a strapping football player Alabama values Central yeah and whoever coached her cuz they must have sent someone in to do that uh did her a grave disservice and then it got comes down to the basics and they just they gave her a bunch of junk to say I mean the story about the poor woman who was sex trafficked through Mexico that she made the Bush Administration right 20 years ago which does not make it yeah any better I guess or Worse how was B's fault yeah right and um now you have that woman speaking out against her and it totally deflated the sales out of the Riley Story the tragedy out of Georgia where the young nursing student was killed by an undocumented guy or I should say illegal if I was Biden though now he has backtracked on that and you know everyone's talking about that and then we're all watching SNL and thinking Scarlett Johansson is funnier than Colin Jo and you know she's the savior of all of this and um I mean I don't know if the reports are true but apparently internally the Republicans are really freaking out that that that's what they put up there on a night where Biden also looked so strong we'll be right back I I want to talk about you Jess you're this is going to sound very sick ofan I think you're a fantastic role model for young women I would just like to know like how give us the cliff notes on on your career and what kind of the biggest influences were on how you got to where you are at such a young age so I moved to London after college I did my junior year abroad there moved back to London and went to the London School of economics and did a couple of master's degrees and a PhD that was focused on the impact of political Scandal on politicians careers um it all started from a love of Bill Clinton um I have since revised a little bit in the me too era My Level congratulation but I'm very in the Clinton camp in terms of what they were able to accomplish and what kind of politician he was you know someone who really just excites you and that's something you know obviously he and Obama have had and I think part of what Joe Biden struggles are right is that he's not a generational talent in the same way but I thought oh if I could figure out a formula for what you have to put into an apology to get out of a jam like the one Bill Clinton was in I would have like the coolest consulting firm of all time so I was going to create this apology Matrix yeah crisis man anyway it didn't work out um there aren't enough examples to do it that way so I did a big quantitative study which is the beginning of my uh data background looking at two different UK parliaments I finished up I went to work on a political campaign actually for Boris Johnson um he was running against Ken Livingston who if you know London politics uh he was the mayor of London a crazy anti-semite um and obviously what conservative and liberal mean over there is very different than here so I did that campaign moved back here and went to work in political polling mostly on issue campaigns um like for Mike Bloomberg and then I started going on air in about 2014 2015 and my old boss who was Bill Clinton's pollster in the '90s actually pushed me to do more conservative media not only does it kind of sharpen your skills he said they need good people out there representing our point of view and so I started going on Fox and they liked me and I liked them and I have been there formally since the 2016 election and became the co-host of the five uh a little more than two years ago you represent a new trend and that is typically when there's these group or panel media shows what they would do is if they were conservative they'd bring on what I would call a foil or someone who made them look good like remember Hannity Colmes whatever you think about Sean Hannity he's smart and he's charismatic Shan Colmes was not I remember the view had Cindy McCain and I thought Cindy McCain just helped them make their points and what I have found interesting and it's a testament to Fox is um and a testament to the view is I think of and I think um Lissa Farah of the same generation they said you know what when we bring on smart people to push back on us it just makes the whole show better anyways your thoughts well I you agree I don't want to you know people who have sat in the seat prior um I have a tremendous amount of respect for and they also you know built these brands that have become so iconic and that I'm benefiting from um but I think that there was definitely a trend towards having either someone more shrill or someone more moderate necess you know in the seat where there could be a lot of kind of nod and smile I agree with what you're saying or shying away from a fight and I think that part of the reason that it works and that Alyssa does such a good job and I totally agree with you about that is there's also some intergenerational fire and that's something that's really important about what's going on right now that you have a lot of older people still in positions of power that are telling younger people what they should think about XY or Z issue right and it's important to represent the ethos of a generation to be able to speak authentically for people who are in their 30s though I just turned 40 last weekend so I have I have a whole new decade to speak for um but I think that that's part of it and then it's also the balance between you know what kind of environment you want to create for your audience that might like to live in a safe Space versus also what rates and what expands the bubble and that's a lot of the internet clip culture like I know for instance that the five uh the show that I co-host has the highest share of democratic viewership it's about 22 23% but also that majority of people who quote like me right or think that I do something cool or important are not traditional Fox viewers and they're accessing me through Tik Tok and YouTube and Instagram and to some degree uh Twitter or X whatever we're supposed to call it and that gives what you know what we're doing right now and I should say that Herold Ford Jr the former Congressman also we share the seat so we do it um half the week is me half the week is him and I think it's great for the viewers to get to see more of like a blue dog Democrat and then also like a more kind of modern Democrat um out there representing the point of view but people are just not ingesting TV in the same way even with the view you know it's 11:00 a.m. how many people can be sitting at home watching The View mostly people who are stay-at home or retired I mean the average cable news uh viewer is what 66 to 69 there I heard Fox is 69 oh wait I did the math on this once maybe it's 63 so every 43y old who's watching Fox there's an 8 there's an 83 old CNN brags cuz theirs is like 55 it's really it's shocking that young oh I would still think it was kind of later 60s it could I mean it could be but also the numbers aren't that fantastic as well so um without doing kind of a ratings brag um you know people are and I think that it Loops back to the conversation we were having about politics and the independence and the moderates deciding the elections people are not interested in the kind of circle jerk conversations that we're having they don't want to see the fights remember at the beginning of the Trump era it was all like Anna Navaro and I forgot who she was always paired with and they were like yelling at each other um that was Crossfire yes but like louder and more aggressive and I don't think that that works for people anywhere they actually want to see a conversation they want to know that the people that they're watching are being thoughtful about it and prepared um and I think that that's a big yeah you definitely you're definitely you and Alissa both bring I think are great role models for young people thinking about how to disagree in not only a civil way but an effective way because whenever I see you respond to what I feel are just kind of ridiculous statements U by your co-hosts you don't ever make it personal you don't ever get loud you just respond with facts and data and a view and they all look like they were just caught you know stealing something they all just look oh God God we've been exposed in the middle of of doing something that's clearly clearly not accurate um so a couple things as we wrap up here you're uh the mother of one is that right mother of one until mid April and then and you're expecting I I knew that but I've been told unless you see the head crown and you never say anything about uh someone is expecting so I was I was setting up for you to say that that's that's good advice if and how has being a mother and someone who is expecting changed your view if at all on politics what's important to you in how you approach your job having kids for me was the most fundamental change in my life and it wasn't like instant I mean actually it was instant when my first child was born like immediately freaked out that I didn't have my money but it also that definitely happens oh my God it's like oh I'm successful and I need to make a lot more money anyways um talk to me about how it's changed your view of the World At Large and and and and specifically how you think about politics and our country well it makes you more Forward Thinking right like you're before we were expecting you know you think about like what amazing vacation are we going to take next year right like I call it that how come I I call it that how come I week can be more fabulous that was my focus before I had oh my God totally and you're like young living in New York City you have enough money for any brunch you want and like any great trip and suddenly your retirement means something you're being swarmed with information about 529s you start to think about all these things that we did like higher education I mean I'm one of the more overeducated people uh certainly even in my friend group and I went to private school in New York City and I'm thinking like well what if she wants to do a PhD right what what if she want wants to go to med school what if all these things need to happen what do I need to do the being more successful part but also what does the world look like for her and it sounds like a cliche but it just changes and you start to reimagine lives purely based on what will be better for these little people like we could make it work from anywhere I mean you're said I don't know exactly where you are right this second but you have a very International life I don't know if you're in London or New York or you're still in Austin atin Texas you're still in Austin mhm right and you're hooked up and you're doing this and you don't have to miss a beat for your lives but your boys have a whole ecosystem That Matters to them from their friends to their academics to the kind of culture that you want to raise them in I thought a lot about how do I get back to Europe I I still think that it's better to raise children there you know on the weekend like do I want to go to Paris or do I want to go to Philadelphia I love Philly but that's a tough one that's a tough one if you want a cheese steak I guess you have to the Philly option um but then you do think about like I'm not some climate change radical but you do think about the quality of the earth I think a lot about obviously reproductive Freedom I'm going to have two daughters you know what happens if they go to college in a state that's not going to let them get the care that they need you know girls sometimes get pregnant in college and they sometimes don't want to have that baby or something terrible happens you know and family plan anyway I don't need to give you a whole Do's recitation but everything becomes more forward-looking and everything becomes less about you I have never cared about myself Less in life than when I've had a child 100% it's the way I describe it is for the first time in your life you are legitimately instinctively and naturally more concerned with something else more so than you and I found it actually quite it's there's a lot of anxiety I got to make more money if I fail I fail for this thing too but it's actually quite liberating and um I find I find it relaxing it's like by Thursday I was like how do I hang out with more fabulous people have more relevance make more money and now it's like well I know what I'm doing I'm going to soccer practice and taking them to some it's just it's somewhat liberating you to think about something else just automatically it's like your life is redefined in a pretty positive way it's hard first couple years especially if you're like me and you're selfish the there's so much of you're saying that's that I relate to I lived in New York with my partner and kids and I remember when our second one came along I'm like well we want to send them to Grace Church or First Presbyterian because we're narcissists and we want to be able to tell our friends at birthday party said oh we're First Presbyterian at Grace Church family it was $58,000 Plus in the interview they ask you if you're philanthropic which is code for how much money are you going to give us are you giving to me not to other causes yeah they don't care about plan paranoids they're like how much money you going to give us at the auction and so I thought okay uh pre-tax I'm going to have to make another quarter of a million dollars a year or $200,000 a year to have two kids in this city and I moved to Florida and I did it for a lot of reasons their grandparents are there but some of it was economic I just thought okay if I can have a remote lifestyle and I can I'm blessed with that I can my cars my house my plane tra everything can be paid for in tax savings and it and then in terms of Europe the reductive analysis I've made is I think you should stick I'm really good at Living other people's lives just so call me anytime you want me to tell you how to dictate your life but America is still the best place to make money Europe is the best place to spend it although the the real gift we purchase of living in London is that you know school shootings trans rights uh a woman's rights these aren't even conversations in London we like well of course a women should have rights to Family Planning of course we're not going to have a salt w it's not even a conversation they're like they look at us and they kind of their head and but also to be clear seven of 10 companies that have gone public in the UK in the last 10 years are below their offering price the UK hasn't grown in five years there's just Money Matters and there's not the same opportunities for Economic Security there are in the UK so my net advice is keep killing it Bank some money in the US move to a low tax state make more money and then move to London boom you see it's all figured out Jess I'll just go on the Galloway plan there you go there you go right ride solv all of my problems if you could birth for me next month that would be great as well because that's pretty icky you know a few more ketamine trips I might try um so uh last question and I know this is something uh near and dear for both of us and I'm I'm having trouble um uh I'm gonna talk about Israel I'm having trouble reconciling how to thread the needle of speaking openly and honestly about how we feel about it while recognizing the very real concerns the quite frankly it's turned me off the far left it's it's almost taken me from Center left to center right it's created really strange bed fellows here but I'm curious one if you're willing to talk about it personally how it's impacted you personally but also how do you think it plays out in the election I can't tell if this is going to help Biden or Trump what are your thoughts so two-part answer I guess um I'll start with the election part of it first so I think it's basically a nothing for Trump I I I don't think he's actually touched the issue and I expected M much more actually out of him he C came out of the gate pretty terribly criticizing BB which I I myself am very critical of him but to the people who would support Trump because of Israel that was a major no no and he he doesn't really talk about it anymore at all um in terms of for Biden My Hope Is that this is not an issue that we are talking about because whatever hostages are alive and I have very low expectations for how many of them are still alive or in kind of any sort of good working condition um obviously the reports from the child psychologists to the general practitioners of what they have seen on these hostages that have been freed are so harrowing that you it makes you wonder if these are lives that are going to feel worth living for these people and that's a total heartbreak but I don't Envision it being what we're going to be talking about come the fall um if Netanyahu can you know continues with kind of what he's doing with the settlements and making this about other things besides October 7th he should be out by then um and you have seen this kind of sea change in the admin rtion not that there isn't a support for Israel but that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has gotten so enormous that Biden cannot afford to just stand there and say Israel you do whatever you need to do anymore um so I I don't foresee it being being a thing at this particular moment you know in Dearborn Michigan is it a thing for sure um is it going to be when you see those two candidates names on the ballot I I just don't see it Jessica tarlo is a co-host on the five Fox's weeknight news program she also offers political analysis across fnc and Fox Business networks fbn programming Jessica is also the vice president of research and consumer insight for Buell digital group she joins us from her home in Manhattan just I was asked uh by my my superiors at Vox if you could co-host a podcast with anyone who would it be and I said the woman who showed me up on Bill Mah I started out I started out not loving you Jess was the the other panelist on my fourth experience on Bill Maher and um to be blunt I've always done really well on that show and I love going on the comments and YouTube and getting you know hearing people say how wonderful I am except when I was on with you it was all she's amazing just for president uh I I I metant what I said I think you are such a fantastic role model for young women and young people you work hard you're dat driven you are incredibly courageous you do not back down but you're you have this nice thoughtful caring demeanor about you you're making a ton of money you're successful you're married to a big handsome dude you're having kids I just think you're a wonderful role model for young people and an inspiration and I just it's so gratifying to see someone like you this new generation of leadership just Ascend the way you are ascending so well done and and and go girl you go girl thank you so much uh um I think you're fantastic I was so excited when we got paired on bah um I did not read the comments but I doubt that it was all about me certainly for everyone on my side of the fence they were like what is Scott Galloway like tell me yeah it was it was trust me anyways Jess have a great w the [Music] week [Music]
