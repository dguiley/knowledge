# 99 Percent Founders Missing AI Agents 2025

Published: 2025-01-05

this is a post Ione on LinkedIn where the person is just saying how we replaced a 100K per year media buyer with an AI agent built on CLA and this post has 10,000 comments so it is just incredible how people are having fomo about AI agent why combinator that literally says vertical AI agents could be 10 times bigger than SAS if you look at the trend it's it's rising it's very it's going up so why is that why is there such a hype and actually what is an AI agent right because that's the first uh question we want to answer and this is what I'm going to try to do in this video what is an a agent and why you should care about it but the very important thing I would like to share with you in this video is what do we consider as an agent what is an automation and what is an actual agent because you will find people mentioning agents everywhere but they are not all agents there are different things there are basic automations or AI automations or agents or multi agent system and I BR it down for you so you can really understand the different steps and I also created a real world example so you can see what you can create with this different step of automation up to AI agents and since you are watching this video you probably a Founder either you you don't have many employees and you would like to um grow yourself with a or you already have employees and system in place and you would like to automate and optimize as much as possible uh your workflows then I've created this um framework to for you to start thinking of how can you optimize that I'm not talking about replacing all your employees I'm just thinking that my point is that people should do meaningful things and with this framework you start thinking of okay what are the daily tasks that don't have value that I can replace with different kind of either automation um Dynamic AI automations AI agents or multi-agent system but okay it's not that easy right building this kind of system um is tough and but I'm still going to show you my point is not to give you a tutorial about a agent I just want to for you to understand what you can do with it what is the state of AI agents right now and if you want to dig further then I will point you to two different ways either you can build it with code or you can build it with no code which is what I've done and I will show you the different tools and where you can start uh Gathering data finding people um so you have a very good start in your journey of thinking of implementing AI agents in your business all right so first let's talk about what is my AI agent this is a very simple tool and I'm not going to go technical here but basically I've created a telegram charts that you can see Trigger here uh and when I interact with this telegram chat it goes it just takes the the input of my chat right here and it sends it to the agent and the agent has first a brain then it has a memory then it has um Vector database um which I'm going to talk about a little bit later and it also has access to another agent which is an agent that is special Iz in managing my calendar and if I ask this agents to set up a meeting then it will ask the the other agent to set up the meeting and the other agent has access to the tools it will proceed the task send back the information and then this agent will tell me okay that was done then I can ask to update it to delete it whatever it is a very basic step but it's just a learning project uh but it can go a lot further because this agent can have a lot of different uh accesses to tools to other sub agents um to databases it can be huge and you can literally create an army of lital agents and that's what samman was talking and that's how in the future it will be possible for a one person business to have the equivalent of what a complete organization is doing these days this is with no code but the same thing can be done with C obviously uh but the thing is the fact that I can do it that fast while finding all the information on the internet right now tells you that this is something that is going on and evolving very fast because it just took me a few days to come up from nothing to learning this new tool and creating that so imagine what we can do in the next six months all right so let's talk about what is an agent I will tell you the the the only cool definition iPhone for an agents and then we will look at it after we break down the different step an AI agent is a system that uses an llm to decide the control flow of an application it's very straight forward and it it kind of makes sense to me now okay this is um different steps that I want to go through from the very beginning of a single task to an army of agents that replace a complete organization at the very first step we have an action and if you are not familiar at all with automation um actions are taken through AP eyes which is basically what programmers are using to talk with different tools and you have tools like make.com for example or zapier that make makes it make it really easy for you to access those apis so basically um you can connect any tool with any other tool um but I think at this point you are probably aware of that because a lot of people are talking about it already so it's very easy to connect tools even for someone that is not coding but this is just actions we are talking about what's happening Point by Point send an email create a calendar event post social media we can do all of that with every tool so that brings us to automation if you use for example make.com then you can say okay uh when this happen take this action then this action then this is the final result and this is not an agent right this is an automation it has been around since probably decades I don't know years for sure but it's even possible decade nothing fancy here and you probably have heard about AI Automation and this is where the confusion um starts happening when you have an automation that uses AI it does like that so when this happen this is just an example when this happen take this action then send it through to chat GPT or Cloe whatever process whatever result I have then you can take another action then I have my final result and some people would say that this is an agent after a lot of research I can tell you this is not an agent this is an automation that is using AI I but it is not an agent because the definition of an agent is a system that uses an llm to decide the control flow of an application and in this case it doesn't decide it just processes an information then we start entering what we call the agentic systems it's like the category where we start talking about agent Behavior it's not an agent yet but it has this agentic Behavior because it decide the control flow of an application and now we can still build that in make. come is the exact same thing but we will have an input so I call that Dynamic AI Automation and we would have an input that an input or when this happen then with the information provided an llm CH GPT CLA Gro Lama whatever llm you want you can access them all will decide what action to take based on the information that are available to it and this starts being called an agentic system it's a simple automation but the fact that we give the llm the large language model the choice to take one action or the other then this is the moment where we start talking about agents or agentic system not agents sorry all right so the next step so so far we run to an action then we can put several actions together then we can add an AI in the middle of it and it's still only an automation then we give AI the choice to take different action that's a dynamic AI Automation and then comes the AI agent and this is where like the the biggest breakthrough is happening right now is because we gave tools we gave the ab ab ability to an llm to not only decide the flow but also take actions and so here we have if that this happen with the information available an llm can go through it's um R mean stands for augmented generation this is access to a database this is what you see here it's a vector database and I'm not going to go too far on it then it can also access to different tools and it also it also has a memory now what tools can he access can it access so it can take just an action you can do something like send an email calar event add the r to spreadsheet create a contact in cm it can also process information to a simple automation so an agent can call an automation it can also use an AI automation and it can also use a dynamic AI Automation in this case this llm will decide which tool is the most relevant for it to accomplish its task and the last one is that it also can call other agents that also have access to retrival augmented generation tools and memory and this can go on and on until it creates a complete system with different agents talking with each other hey just a quick break if you are an e-commerce fer you might be interested in that I recently started working with two incredible Ecom marketers and we decided to put together all of our knowledge and and start creating the first AI agents for e-commerce Brands so it's a long process because we don't want to just talk about the what create clicks and and the hype around it as you can see in this video we really want to create useful systems for e-commerce and especially for marketing whether it's creating new new ads creating vsls advertorial uh uh reporting analytics dashboard we want to optimize as much as possible this part so if you are an e-commerce owner and you want to dig into that with us then check out the description uh you probably will find um a quick form so we can get in touch with you and simply have a call and start talking about um your current problem and how we can help back to the video before I go to the multi-agent system let me uh quickly tell you about retrival augmented generation if you haven't heard about it I put somewhere here um a little graph um so it's a database uh a 3D database basically you enter an information and the AI will transform this information whatever it's whether it's text or image or whatever the information in a a string like a piece of um numbers that place the information in a 3D database like that based on Plenty of different parameters and the next time you ask something to this Ai and it goes ahead and and look into this this Vector database it will look at the most the the closest result to the query it just made based on your information and for example here uh that's the query and those are the things that all next to it actually I don't even know what's a kitten but probably you know uh but for example if I would querry um uh give me another fruit name then it would go ahead and say hey we have H in our database so that's what is retrival augmented generation and that's the way company can store all their workflows all their processes all their guideline values the the way that they talk with the customer they can have all of that through into different Vector database databases and every agent can call the right database to retrive the right information about the company it's a process that is very fast so and always give the the just the right amount of information to the LM to accomplish the next task of course when it's done well and it's not that easy to be honest but it's a it's very feasible and and it's feasible without any line of code so it's pretty cool okay so now let's talk about multi agent systems just before remember we have an agent that that can already access to all the tools above plus the act the agent can access different agents and now we talk about multi-agent systems which are basically automations that work with different agents that can call other agents right that under each agent we don't know how many layers we have I didn't come up with that stuff the um it comes from a very interesting um uh article by the way you have all the sources the the most important article I have read uh for This research uh and it's here building a effective agent entropy came up with different ways so you can create those systems and I have just changed a little bit the color put them together so it fits to what I wanted to demonstrate in this video but I didn't change the the way they built it so here you have the prompt chaining workflow so you would have an input then it calls an agent then this agent whatever other agent or tools or automation calls will create an output that's a result and based on this output then we can decide if it stops or if it needs to be to go to another agent that has another role and the same thing the output would go to another agent and finally we have the result we have here the parallelization workflow which is uh having one uh it goes It's good to to to act faster because you will have several agents working together at the same time then we aggregate the result then we have the final re uh here we have the routing workflow which is like one main agent that will decide which agent to call to accomplish the right task here you have the orchestrator workflow which is similar um but maybe it will um I to be honest I didn't really get the the difference between those um maybe it just can call several but it just give you another aspect and you have one that is very kind of trendy is the idea of having an evaluator um agent which means when you ask an agent to create something then he he would sometimes hallucinate sometimes he won't C things right away but you if you give another you know if you if you ask in another conversation uh to chat GPT to check uh to review the the I don't know the article that you just wrote then it will be much more thorough to find the potential mistake so the idea is to have one agent that is generating something and send it to the evaluator which is going to make sure it's it's following um the company's guidelines if yes then it's over if not then he says hey please change that then the uh agent generator will change that send it back and again and again until it goes out because it follows everything we wanted to do so those are might seem complicated um but and I didn't want to spend too much time on this one because what I want is for you to understand the Global Concepts that bring you from U this simple task to an army of Agents acting all together and they are not the only ones that exist right it's all about creativity and you have like thousands of programmers these days that are coming up with new ideas and building new systems it's it's a complete new field in the building right now but let's have a look at a real world example I I tried to come up with something that you can rely on uh as a Founder so let's say we are talking about um an ad campaign optimization you want to maintain um to manage an ad campaign that is running so if you have an automation here then what you can do is every morning collect the ad performance data from Facebook create a simple report and send it by email the same process repeats daily okay that's very easy to do now if you add AI in the mix then you pull the performance data pass it through AI to generate a standardized performance analysis that's the AI part then send it to a predetermined team memb because AI didn't choose follow the same path every time with AI an announcing the analysis all right now we starts the agentic system uh and we have a dynamic AI automation so here AI monitors performance data and decide what action to take which metric needs attention who needs to be modified what kind of reports to generate and when to escalate issue the P changed based on what the AI discovers so obviously here you have only two routers but as soon as you send the data of the daily performance to whatever AI then it can decide on uh what should I do where should I focus my attention and who should I call um should I send an email to the fer uh or should I um talk about the performance manager uh and this can be each a different router road I don't know how to call that a different Ro in the automation it's not like an agent it's just like okay you have an input based on this input what do you think we should talk to this yes or not this one yes or not this one yes or not okay do you think we should alert about this metric yes or not yes or not it is pretty simple but already really useful and you can definitely create this with make.com it's very easy I love this tool by the way and so far it was the only one I was focusing on before I started uh using the one I showed you before which I'm going to talk about in a minute all right now let's back to it to the the real world example we have ai agents and now the a agent would monitor your ad account performance coordinate between your ad platform and Reporting tools send the right information to the right team members and maintain a clear dashboard of all advertising activities so you get it here every day would have an input and it will have the the agent would have access to different tools so it can uh update the dashboard it can send an email to the right person that needs to pay attention to something it can um do plenty of things in parallel and then say okay I'm done with the task for today the agent decided the action to take and it also decided which tool to use for that now if we have a multi-agent system then one analyzes performance across all platform so this is a guy like that right another creates add variations to test so there is one that is a Creator it just comes up with it researches and then it comes up with a different idea it ideates about new angles and create them um somewhere store them somewhere and maybe even start creating the ads for example another handles reporting teams and teams notification and team notification so it's I say it's just one that is specialized into talking with the right person and you can have a supervisor agents coordinating everything and deciding the next step so this is where you start creating a team basically all right I hope so far it wasn't confusing and you were able to follow along because now I would like to show you it's pretty simple but this is how you start thinking of how do I implement it in my business and if you think basically the the idea behind it is to take what you do in your business and split it into chunks that are as small as possible so you can start automating them and that's not an easy thing to do but outside of Agents businesses that have solid processes in place literally have a lot more chances to success there are plenty of business that operates on a daily chaos that's not the right thing to do even before thinking of about agents it's a lot better to write down everything so when an employee leaves with the business then the other one just have to go in and read what is it's supposed to do and and act upon it so technically you should have WR that written down somewhere if you don't then you need to to start writing down um because that's the first step before starting talking about automation but now let's assume you have done that or you have access to that so let's talk about if we have um the paid acquisition Department in your business I don't like the the word Department it sounds really corporate but it's just for the sake of the example let's say you have two employees one is a media buyer uh and then the media buyer is doing campaign management uh is also doing uh analytical reporting and it has another whatever responsibility so we have the department the the the person then the responsibility they have and each responsibility includes different tasks so perform for example in company management you have performance monitoring you have ab AB testing you have creating new ad copies and in performance monitoring then it includes um different access and actions to tools so for example you have Facebook ad manager Google analytics and what different kind of spreadsheets and now if you look you start by the the very bottom and you say okay let's try to um in to optimize the paid acquisition system so what can we replace by the simplest way as possible you don't want if you if you can automate all your business without ever create an AI agent then just go for it because AI Agents come um with different problems latency um hallucination cost and so that's why it's not there yet and if you can do it with simple automation it's way better so always keep it simple for example um the Facebook ad manager maybe maybe we can the person is only doing what we described here so if we can replace this action with this then let's create an automation for that then the same goes with Google analytic maybe we can just pull um the data from Google analytic put them through report and send it VI email to the same person every day with the simplest automation as possible then we have um the spreadsheet so for example we'll fill uh up the the different data for the day the the CTR the CPM and in this case we also want for example to add a little observation that uh would talk about the the performance from yesterday so it's just a little comments um that we want to put on the spreadsheet so we need some kind of intelligence so let's say in this case we would create a linear AI automation it's just a simple automation but we just uh process data through um a large language model so we have a better result and completes the spreadsheet all right so now we have uh kind of automated the three different tasks that this person is doing for person monitoring and now we can say okay let's create an agent so it will it will do all of that and decide what to do no because if there is no need for an agent then fine you can simply just uh create a dynamic air automation or even another automation if it's if it works perfect so here let's say we create we just need a dynamic AI automation um that will every day um make sure the the the result of each ones have been checked whatever it's just an example you do the same for AB testing and creating ad copies you look at different actions you find a way to automate them the simplest as possible until you have everything under control and then here for example you can say okay now I think U for C management um I need some kind of intelligence to manage and um I also need some kind of um compressed outputs like a results that um I need someone to talk to for this campaign management I need a chat where I can go and say where are we on the AB testing what's the last thing that we did can we do that then maybe here you want to start implementing an AI agent and that's the first one in the line that you are implementing you do the same thing for analytic and Reporting maybe it's an a agent maybe not again right but maybe it's the first one and now you have like okay so the person the metab at some point if only if you arrive to the the conclusion that everything is working fine with different automations na agents here here and there then you can have an agent that is the coordinator uh so if I go back here uh which one is it so or orchestrator workers workr so you have an agent that talks about different agents here that acts on upon different automations they have access to actions whatever and at this point then you have replace the med and this is what the person is saying here I I know that the person didn't mean it this way um in this case it's not like really you look at the the the post it's not really replacing a maab because it's only like from what I've seen it's uh showing data met does a lot more things than just talking about the the data of the day um as we can see here and that's really not exhaustive the list but you can really do it here is that there is a real walk underneath uh but at some point if you if you dedicate time on it then it's going to be possible and to go back to what I've said um so I'm I'm well done with this approach but I wanted to take a moment to talk about the different problems that we have for creating agents and I found this report quite interesting um it's the state of Agents um it's a very recent report and let me pull the right information does your company currently have agents in production so yes no 50/50 are currently developing an agent we plan um plan to put it into production so a lot of people are working on their agents not a lot have them working yet um in your opinion which task agents best suit uh are best suited for to perform today not all of the tasks are are well done by agents these days um a lot of them are but not all of them so that's why it's not totally possible to replace every business with with agent we that's a that's a fact right uh what kind of control no that's not interesting uh what kind of tool okay wanted to find another one all right what is your best limitation of putting more agents into in production performance and quality half of the people um un performance quit cost safety concerns latency and although I don't know what it is but those four things here performance quality means the more you give freedom to an agent the less sure the less the answer is solid basically if I have um this A multi-agent system that talk to another multi-agent system that talk to an agent that talk to different agents and automations then at some point if I give too much freedom to each of the steps then the the potential error increases along the way that's why it's better to build on automations because when automation is completely finalized then there is almost no there is no bug no hallucination as soon as you start putting an llm in the into the mix then it starts like maybe you get to 90% success rate then you have 10% that are not working and that a lot of company can't afford it that's why it's very hard these days to come up with such a system but anyway I just wanted to mention that um and so far we have had a look at the the agent that I built we had a look at what are the different steps and how you can implement it in your business and now the last thing I would like to um show you quickly how you can build them or rather how you can start digging into it um in case you want to to make that as a priority or important topic for the year to come so you have two ways the code and the no code so that's quite obvious if you want to go for the code routs then here you can find this uh gup repository which combines all the different tools that you need and it starts by the cloud providers and the different models you can use like mistol entropy Grog and plenty of other model that I don't even know those are like the equivalent of CH GPT right and then you have different layers that I honestly I have no idea what it is um I can guess for a few of them but this is really something for programmers and the thing is if if you go to this Reddit this subreddit sorry AI agents and you spend a moment reading the the different threads then you can see that the people are not joking with that they are really working on it since months if not years and they are building things that are in production that are working so in the Cod code world of AI agents you can go very deep and find people that are actually really qualified into AI agents I Haven found this newsletter let me put it so this is a post by uh Shu shanka which is developer I think is um is working in the Silicon Valley um very interesting read um a lot of ideas on how to build the next steps of agents at a very very deep level I put the link in the file here which I forgot at the beginning uh but that's that tells you that they are already like suback dedicated to building agents there are people working every single day on that so you can really find important information there is also this YouTuber which I haven't completely explored yet because he's doing both code and no code but is really good in explaining the different steps uh explaining the core principles so this is definitely something to check out if you want to start leing into uh creating solid agents for business uh then there is the no code rotes and that's my way because I don't know how to code um and I was able to quickly find a lot of information and actually the one that put me on the way was this video which I found was really awesome it it led me to to understand that I could create it with Ann which which I couldn't um before and then I dug in the rapid hole and so I put here a lot of videos that you can check that brings you to the channel um that you can dig into to find more information you also have anen um courses I'm talking about n8n since a while now I didn't explain what it is um that's basically if you haven't um I hope you have heard about zapia zapia is like the the automation tool that everybody knows it's kind of the beginner layer of automation when you want to go a little bit further than you you have mag.com which is an incredible tool which is as a very user friendly uh UI um it's really Pleasant to to work with and you can do so many things but there are things you can't do and those things you can do it with NM which is basically the same kind of tool but on top of that you can run code in an and anen it's hard for me to say and you can also you also have what I showed you at the beginning an agent system that is built in which means and here I'm going to go back to this part I wanted to show you uh here what makes this Parts possible is what we call an agentic framework and there are plenty of agentic framework like let me show you two for example um I've heard a lot about on YouTube specifically um here you have L chain which is another one so what it does is basically it it it's a layer layer of code that make it easier for people to interact that creates an agent basically the open AI for example would provide the model you can say ask the model something and it will tell you something back but they create this kind of block of code that you would plug on it and now you talk to discode and discode will U interact in the model in a certain way to tell it to okay now you need to look into your database now you first check out your memory and then oh yeah you need to call this tool and call it this way use this variable and that's an agenty framework it's what's it's not absolutely needed but it what makes uh agents a lot easier to create and the thing is this this block already so it's an8 it's already using this agentic framework length chain and that's why when I go back to uh where is it oh yeah sorry when I go back back here to my three tools I mentioned even though I love using make then it doesn't have an agentic framework built in so you can you literally can't build agent the same way as you do in an8 you could but it would require such a complicated process that's why if you go no code I suggest you just go with NM at first make is good for creating awesome automations but Maden is good for creating agents you can use both but if you want agents then it is this way and the thing is a lot of good and um smart people are using anaden for creating um agentic systems and you can find plenty of content uh on YouTube already uh you can also go to the um the Reddit the subreddit n8n where a lot of people are sharing what they're doing and obviously it's a good place to hang out all right that's it for this video uh I hope you found it useful I hope you now understand a little bit better why you should pay attention to agents because they are real thing they are not a hype you really maybe you don't need to change to switch completely your business and and and think of replacing everything with AI and agent right now but at least you should really pay attention because the ones that are doing it at the the the first will have a competitive advantage that's for sure and this is this is going to happen we don't know when we don't know the scale of it but it's already happening uh it's not like um I don't know web 3 where it's an amazing technology uh and and we know that it will be useful at some point but no one was was using it so at some point people got B but now agents are are delivering a result are in production right now let you decide what you do with that all right so see you in the next one bye
