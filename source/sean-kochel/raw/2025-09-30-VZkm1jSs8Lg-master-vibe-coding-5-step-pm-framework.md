# Master Vibe Coding 5 Step PM Framework

Published: 2025-09-30

If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times. If you're having Vibe Code problems, I feel bad for you, son. You've got 99 prompts. But a comprehensive planning process ain't one. What I mean is this. If you're struggling with AI coding and vibe coding, not giving you the outputs you want, and you see all these people on Twitter or YouTube building really cool stuff and claiming it's all done with AI, and you're sitting there saying, "There ain't no way they're doing this vibe coding." Well, then your problem lands in how you vibe, plan, and coordinate the system. Well, this product management prompt sequence I'm about to show you solves that problem. So, I'm going to break down the five pieces and how they all connect together. And we'll specifically talk about why I use each piece and how it helps solve those problems. And if you stay around to the very end, I will show you how you can build them into one agent prompt that you can use in any tool that accepts agents. So that said, let's start where all great things begin, the beginning. So why do we start our process with this product manager prompt in the first place? Not all SAS companies are the same, but at the end of the day, most of them have an organization that follows a similar structure. You have a development team responsible for an area of the product. And you have a product manager that is responsible for that team and what they choose to build. And they make that decision by interviewing the customers, understanding their real core problem, understanding the use cases that might help them, and then determining if this is worth the resource investment of their team. And if it is worth the resource investment, what should we see on the other side of this feature to tell us it was successful and is actually solving problems? So imagine a scenario like this. Imagine your company is YouTube. You've got an entire branch of teams that is likely focused on the core platform. So you have a team that's responsible for the core YouTube viewing experience. You have a team that's responsible for YouTube shorts as a platform. You have an entire team that's probably dedicated to just YouTube TV or live streaming. And then you have an entirely separate set of teams that's responsible for things like the creator side of YouTube, the YouTube studio dashboard, the entire ads platform as its own beast with sub teams galore. And so a product manager within each of those teams is going to determine what are the core problems that my users face and how can we solve them. So for example, if it was the YouTube ads team, what are some problems? Well, media buying is a very intensive process. Copywriting is a very intensive process. Making creative for your ads very timeintensive process. Those are all problems that that team is trying to build solutions for, where they're automating media buying, where they're using AI to actually make your ad creative. They're trying to streamline that process. And a product manager is going to help determine what exactly gets built and why it gets built and how we're going to measure success once it's built. And so that is the process that we're trying to replicate. And so here's an example of this end product that we're going to create where we have this entire agent definition that goes through and creates us a comprehensive documentation of everything that we need to build for our MVP. And it kicks off with a basic prompt where we explain what the app is and kind of high level of who it's for and then the system is going to go through. It's going to kick off the product manager and it is going to document everything for us. So we're going to run this process through piece by piece building an AIdriven fitness app spec. So instead of just prompting randomly, we are going to start building with purpose. So let's go look at the first piece of this process. So, the first step here is going to be making sure we are very clear on the problem we are solving. Because most problems that you run into if you skip this style of planning is that you're going to build stuff that you don't really need. And I'm sure you guys have seen this before. You tell it, hey, go build me a sleep tracking app. And next thing you know, it decided what it was going to build to make a sleep tracking app. And so, especially if you're making an MVP, the question you really need to ask yourself is what is the narrowest problem that you can solve that will still bring value to an end user. So, if we aren't getting super deliberate about getting clear, then what happens is you are abdicating the responsibility of choosing what goes into the app to the language model. And at the end of the day, the language model doesn't know what your vision is. So, what we're going to do is we're going to take our first prompt and we're going to paste it into a tool like Claude. Now, I will say when I run this process, I've actually grown to prefer doing this in a chat interface because I like to have a back and forth dialogue about what exactly we are building. And you'll notice you do get slightly different responses when you're talking to something through like claw desktop compared with using something like claude code or gemini or codec cli or cursor and just saying like hey I want to build this thing respond back to me. You're going to typically get better outputs in this planning phase when it comes to the concept of the app when you're inside of a tool like claw desktop. So we started off with a little bit of persona prompting saying hey you're a product manager with a founders's mindset and you you're really obsessed about the problem that we are solving and then we give what our general approach is. So what is the specific problem? What is the solution? And is it really valid in the context of solving that problem? And then how will we know that these two worlds have been married together? How will we know that the problem is concrete and specific and that our solution solves it for the user? What would we see as far as metrics go to be able to say that that was done properly? And then what we do is we pump in our audience. And you're going to see what you get out the other side is a pretty good first pass at analyzing this app. So again, in the context of this fitness app, what is the core problem? In this case, I'm building this for men specifically. And so men aed 25 to 40, they tend to struggle with bridging the gap between knowing that they should work out versus actually achieving those goals. And why does that happen? So again, the high level of this app was that you upload a photo of your current physique and your ideal of like what you want to look like and then it helps bridge the gap and build a fitness plan toward those goals. That's the high level of this thing. And so the core problem that this audience faces is that it's kind of difficult to bridge the gap between, hey, I know I should work out versus, hey, I'm trying to actually achieve this goal. Now, why does that happen? Tons of information out there, which is often conflicting. Lack of real personalization when it comes to what did I just do and how should that affect what I do next? No real feedback loop. And then you have general time inconvenience barriers, which I don't think is a good excuse. But I do think that these three are very good reasons why someone might not achieve what they're trying to achieve even if they show up and work hard. So then we get into some of the personas who really embody this, right? You have like the former athlete who in college or when they were a kid, they were very athletic, but now that they don't have someone pushing them all the time, they're not really achieving what they need to, right? You have maybe like the new dad who's really time limited and just wants high impact workouts. You got like the desk strapped guy and then you have the person again who just goes all the time but they're always on and off and on and off and on and off never really achieving that result. So then how well does the MVP that we described actually match that? So this critical gaps to address these are going to be areas where we want to think through do we need some sort of feature set that actually addresses these? Do we actually consider that these are real blockers for our app or not? Then we get a little bit of an understanding of who are some of the competitors in this space. This is important because we don't want to just build something that someone else already does and has a huge user base. We want to have some degree of differentiation. And then again, how will we know that it is done well and what decisions do we need to consider making? And so, you can already see how skipping this problem analysis stage might lead you to building something that isn't really valuable because I'm building for a very specific person with a specific problem. I'm not building this app, for example, for a bodybuilder. And so if I were to just go tell it to, hey, go build this fitness app that has AI in it, it might end up building something that's not even for the person that I want it to be for. And then I look at the output, I'm like, hey, I mean, it looks kind of cool, but it's not structured for the person I wanted it structured for. But now that we have this problem solidified, we can transition into the next phase, which is putting those problems into a very concrete vision or a north star. So now we can start putting purpose to our plan because the the real problem if you struggle with using AI to build apps comes down to this. You're not being specific enough about what you are choosing to build, who it is for, and what makes it different from other solutions. Because our app depends on that information in order to build properly. To give an extreme example, the way that you're going to build for your 70-year-old grandma is going to be a lot different than a 24year-old technative Jim Chad. And so, back inside of our chat, we can just use the same context that we had earlier, and now we're going to pass in like this Northstar executive summary prompt. And so what we're trying to do is take all of that and we want to really make this thing very compact and concise because this is going to serve as like a living document that we reference everything back to. So I really love having an elevator pitch like a one to two sentence description of this thing. Again, what problem like what's the coremost problem that it really solves? Who is really the target audience? What makes it unique compared with other competitors? And again, how are we going to know that it was successful? And so we can see when we scroll down exactly what that looks like. It's like having a personal trainer in your pocket who looks at your photos and creates a workout plan just for you and changes it whenever you need, all through a chatbased interface. Problem, men who want to get fit and are stuck between expensive personal trainers they can't afford and generic workout apps that don't work for them specifically. So, we kind of codify that into our target audience. And the thing that I personally like about this app and the approach is that it's a visual goal setting. The way most people work is that they're going to look at, hey, I want to be like what that guy looks like, but then they go out and they try to find like, well, well, what are all the different ways that I could make that happen for myself? And they don't know how to bridge that gap. They don't understand exercise programming. There's no way without working with someone that knows what they're doing that to be able to match or bridge the gap between their physique and that physique. So, I personally think this makes it kind of unique. And then lastly, what is the thing that makes this thing actually unique, right? What makes it stand out from other competitors? And this is why it's important to really hash out those competitors when you're doing your research. So, it's the only fitness app that I've heard of that starts with visual goal setting. The way most people's brains work is they look at something that they want to have and then they think through how can I build a plan for me to get there. So, I think that makes it very unique. And I've really only seen like one maybe two other meaningful chatbased personal training apps like this. So I think combining those two worlds together with a few other things that I know I want to add in here eventually, I think it'll make it very competitive. So if that were all true, how do we know that it is successful? So we want a certain percentage of users actually completing their first program cycle. We want to have a high retention rate. We want to make sure that they are actually doing the workouts. And then we have obviously some business metrics. Now, the one thing you'll notice and what you should be doing if you're actively running this process when you get this first output, you do want to have a back and forth chat conversation because they asked specifically about the monetization, which I did not answer. And so, what you're going to notice now as we scroll down is it has decided for us what the subscription pricing is going to be. Now, if you were to extrapolate that problem across building features, it's going to do the same thing. If you're not specific about exactly what feature you're going to build and how it should flow and how it should function, the language model is going to make decisions on its own. And so, this planning process is about trying to get as specific as possible with what we are going to build. And so, now what we're going to see is this problem where it's now created something that was not our initial idea that we don't agree with. It's going to carry itself through every single prompt. And so I've left this in here intentionally so we can really understand how important it is to be concrete with our planning and leaving no stone unturned. There's a common adage in marketing that applies here. If you try to sell to everyone, you will sell to no one. And similarly, if you try to build for anyone, you're going to build for no one. So, this document should serve as your north star so that anytime you go to build something new, you're always referencing back to who you're building for, why you're building it that way, and the impact it's meant to have on them. So, think of this kind of like a lens that everything passes through to tell you yes, no, go, no go. But now that we have that, we can get into the exciting stuff, fleshing out our features. So, at this point, we're pretty clear on the problem and who we're building for. But how do we translate that into features? Because again, we're not at a point where we can say, "Here's my summary. Now go build the app." Because you're going to end up getting whatever the LLM thinks might be good, similar to how it filled in that pricing for us. So, it's going to do what it thinks might be good, not necessarily what is good or what you want. And so, we want to take the time to plan those features out and go back and forth about what we want and what we want changed. And so the way we do that is with this prompt here. Let's go take a look at it. Now, at this point, if you had any other ideas for your MVP, you would want to paste that in at this stage so that it can take the full context of everything that's gone through and merge that in with what we're about to do. So, what are our core MVP launch blockers? Well, first we need to have this visual goal setting system. And now thinking through our user personas. If I'm the desk worker, I want to upload my photo and my inspiration photo so that I can see exactly what I'm working toward and get a plan designed for my specific transformation. That's a pretty clear well scoped idea. So what are the acceptance criteria? How do we know that it's been done which is going to inevitably inform when we go to build the actual feature? What are the specifics of that feature that needs built? So user uploads two photos. Then when the processing is done, the AI generates a gap analysis understanding the differences between the two people. If there's a poor quality photo that it can't actually get insights from, then it tells the user that it needs a better image. Right? Then we have edge cases. We have our dependencies. We're going to need to have some sort of image processing API. if we want to do body composition analysis. So then we're going to have what are our dependencies to do that properly like how are we going to process the image how do we store the image can we store the image what are the technical constraints on doing that like image file sizes formats and then what are some important UX considerations so this is going to get fleshed out in extreme detail when you go into your user experience and system architect prompts which I go through in a video I will link around here with my eight agent process But this serves as a pretty good highle understanding. And so we go through and we repeat that process now for every major feature. We're going to need to have that conversational program customization agent. So if I'm a new dad and I only have dumbbells, I need to tell the system, hey, I've only got dumbbells. And it needs to go through and be able to fix the plan based on that understanding. And then similarly, we go through what are the acceptance criteria? What are the dependencies that will be needed to make that happen? What are the technical constraints for that? Right? We can't just allow an unending chat with a ballooning context. That will get way expensive for us. And then we probably want to have like some preset boundaries in there. If he says he wants to do five workouts a day, we should probably say, "Hey, that's a terrible idea. I'm not going to do that for you." And then again, some quick little UX considerations, which again, we expand on when we get into the UX exercise. This is our starting point of the exact features we need to have in the app. And so we go through and we continue this process for all of the main features. And then we get into well what are the other features? And I think the mistake a lot of people make is not telling the system to cut these things out. So I want to have an understanding. I want to have a backlog. I would probably put these into like a linear project management app via like an MCP connection which again I have a video on. But I do not want to build these in the first pass. And so what I am going to do is I'm going to say remove those other phases and return me just the MVP. So now I have a very clear-cut understanding of the minimal version of this product that will still bring value to my user. So again for each of these you ask yourself who is this feature really for and does it benefit them based on my northstar. So user stories are what bridges the gap between abstract goal and concrete functionality. Without them, you're going to build features that functionally work, but it doesn't actually solve the core problem of what you wanted this app to do. And then you're going to go comment on YouTube videos and Twitter threads about how AI's hyped and doesn't work when in reality you were just abdicating all responsibility for decision-m over to something that doesn't know how to read your mind. Now the user stories provide the foundation for the next stage which is building our functional requirements for those features. So let's zoom out for a second to a thousand ft view. I have this app and it's meant to solve a specific problem for this person and it does it through these features. But what then are really the requirements of those features? That's not enough for us to say, hey, it uploads an image of two physiques and it builds a plan for it, right? That's kind of abstract still. And so we need to take it a level deeper and understand what are the functional requirements, the non-functional requirements, and the real user experience of this thing. Where does a user actually interact in the app? How is data going to be stored and passed around and handled? What services do we really need to integrate? How fast does it need to be? How many users does it need to scale to? What are the security requirements? How is it really all going to be presented to the end user? We need to answer these questions because again, it informs how the app gets built to solve the problem. So again, we paste this prompt in. And again, you'll notice we have three primary categories. So first up, what are the functional requirements? What does the actual onboarding flow look like from the moment someone opens your app? Well, in this case, we're probably starting with the uploading of the photos, right? Like building out that initial profile. Then we build that gap analysis. So, we're hooking in that backend service. We need to understand what type of equipment they have. Are they more like a home gym? Are they a commercial gym? Are they minimalist? Is the goal entirely unrealistic or unsafe? What's their availability? What's their experience level? what's their injury or limitations, movement patterns they can't do, right? We need to understand all of that. So, that's part of the onboarding flow. What does it look like as someone's executing workouts? As someone's having a conversation, what are all of the meaningful touch points within each of these feature stories that we created? What does like the state of the data need to look like in the app? user states, the different program states for like the workouts and the exercises and the cycles that they're on. How are we going to manage the actual context of the conversation and that the AI understands or has context behind the user's experience level and equipment when they go to make those plans for them? How are we going to manage all of that stuff? And so we start going through all of these functional requirements again. What are all of the different external services that we're really going to need to have? We're going to need to have a CDN for storing images. Probably going to want in-app push notifications, user analytics, payment processing. We're going to need to think about like real time syncing back and forth with workouts. What if the user accidentally closes the app down or the app crashes or something and they're in the middle of a workout? Do we save that state or not? These are again all very important because when we go into the next stages of our process, we need to have this stuff ironed out or else the app's going to decide, right? you might not want an offline queue and then it spends a ton of time trying to build one for you. That's the type of stuff we're trying to avoid. What are the nonfunctional requirements that are still important? Photo uploading can't take forever. Chats can't take forever to respond. The program should be generated in less than 15 seconds. If we're trying to show somebody a form exercise of a video and they're on their data cuz they're at a gym and they're not on Wi-Fi, it can't take 20 seconds for every video to load. how much data are we actually expecting, right? Because we're going to incur a cost. If somebody's storing 50 megabytes per year, that becomes part of like the unit economics of what makes this business profitable or not. So, we need to kind of understand this stuff. So, we go on, we then pass through security requirements, and then we get into like highlevel UX, which again we're going to deep dive into in later prompts and agents that we have. But on a high level, what do things look like? How is information being architected and presented to users? What does the nav look like? How is content presented in the app? What are all the different subviews someone can pop into? How do we choose to show people information strategically so that they're not overwhelmed all at once with the amount of stuff that might be in here? How do we prevent surface and handle errors? How are we really engaging the user with feedback in the app? All of this stuff very very important for us to consider because again it's adding in another layer of granularity to our plan which we can use later on to make sure that everything conforms to that plan. A lot of people start backwards. They start with like the tech stack and a general idea and say hey go build me an app on this tech stack with this general idea of what I want to have. And then after it's gone and built a bunch of stuff they say now add this feature. Now add this feature. Now add that feature. Next thing you know, it's a hodge podge and it doesn't really work very well. But now that we have these clear requirements, we can move on to arguably one of the most important stages, which is finding our gaps. We want to make sure we don't have critical blind spots that will derail our entire plan. So again, last major piece of the puzzle. What are some unexpected things that maybe we haven't thought through fully enough yet? Odds are you are not an expert in all of the things related to your app. So we need to make sure that our fundamental assumptions are properly challenged. Without this step, you might miss out on a huge black swan in your implementation. So we paste in the prompt. And one disclaimer here, when you do this in a chatbased interface like claw desktop or chatgbt, you are going to get a lot more push back on the fundamental business assumptions of your project. Not everything that the language model says is going to necessarily be a valid criticism. I specifically made this prompt to be an anti-yman. And so it's going to go over the top with some of the things that it tells you might be a critical misstep in your assumptions. Now, if you use this as an agent inside of a tool like Claude Code, for example, it's not going to go into the business considerations. It's going to give you critical blockers as far as the actual code is concerned. That's an important distinction to make when you go through this process. So, just be aware of that. So again, on the business side, it's laying out a lot of admittedly pretty critical things to consider. Obviously, with an app like this one that we're working on, major liability risks. It's saying number two, the AI can't see form, like it can't see people's workout form. That's fine because I don't I don't want this to be an AI form app. So, I'm not really concerned about this. It's meant to just build the programs and then I'm going to integrate like open-source or public form libraries for them. So, the next thing that it's saying is that the program logic is vaporware, meaning it's saying that like you're claiming you can look at two photos and create a valid training program, but that's technically questionable. I've run this myself personally, and so I know that it can do this. I know it can look at two photos and actually understand the differences between the two photos. And so, I think part of like the thing that's going to help this be a little bit more of a moat is how it creates the plan intelligently based on the gap between these two photos. So again, I don't really agree with this one. And now you can see why I'm saying it's not creating technical considerations for us here. These are all about the business model itself and your implementation. So again, this is tied to number three. It's basically saying every fitness app will eventually have conversational AI. And so that enough that like that alone can't be what you think differentiates you. And that's fine because that's not what I I think differentiates it. Again, it's saying the unit economics might not work. And that's because we didn't actually talk about what the price was. We just let it decide. So, I'm going to ignore this one for now. I'm going to consider it obviously, but not a super valid criticism for me right now. And then again, it's it's talking about everything in the context of the business case. And so if we were to pop now over into where I ran this inside of uh Claude code in this case and we go to the same output and we scroll down to these critical considerations, we can see that it's been a lot more concise about what it considers the key gaps are and they're almost all about like technicality, right? It's talking about like the actual data sets that this stuff's going to be based on and how we know it's good. Does the monetization model actually support what we're doing? How are you going to consider a mobile first versus like a cross-platform development strategy? Are you going to expand this internationally because then you need to consider localization? So, a lot more focus on like the actual technical areas of clarification. So, this is an area where you could run an entirely separate prompt that just looks at like technical gap considerations. Now, this is something that honestly could be its own agent definition where you're going to have it go out and do research and spend a lot of time looking through all of your feature stories and what you plan to build and really finding critical gaps in each of those from like a technical perspective. Being very specific about how many users you plan to scale to and all of the different edge cases of things. And I would run that process when I get into the actual like task planning of things. Now, in the description below, I have this entire agent definition that you guys can download out and use inside of your own workflows. And obviously, feel free to modify it to your own needs. So, why do we do this? Unknown unknowns are really the Achilles heel of vibe coding, especially if you do not have a technical background. If you weren't like an actual software developer or product manager, unknown unknowns are one of the things that can really slow your progress because you do not want problems to emerge when you're 75% of the way done with what you are building. And now you realize, holy I'm not going to be able to handle all of the image uploads that take place and I'm going to be screwed. If only I had built a queuing system. So now that we have this product blueprint, what do we do next? This is where we turn our documentation into much more concrete plans. And we do that through our UX prompts and our system architecture prompts. Meaning, we're going to get super detailed on the exact user experience with each feature and very concrete details of what exactly that feature is going to flow like and look like and how the user is meant to interact with it. And then once we have that, we build an overarching technical architecture document where we go into all of the tech that's going to be needed. So if you want to see that process done with a real app, I have a four-part video series on this channel where we actually use these prompts. The first two of those videos are done where this process is already covered. I will link that around here somewhere. You can go watch it. So that's it, guys. Five steps to creating a product plan that actually works. Make sure to subscribe if you want more downto- earthth, very practical tutorials and workflows like this that will help you bridge the gap from entrylevel vibe coder to someone that can actually produce things and send them out to people knowing that they will actually work. But that's it for this video. I will see you in the next
