# Market research is easy actually

Published: 2024-12-08

this video I'm going to show you how to master market research why do you need to master market research it's because that is the core fundamental of marketing you need to understand your customer so you can create a good message so people pay attention to your product to your business and everybody talks about market research everybody tells you you need to do it but no one really tells you how and yeah you can go and read it and and try to see what people do but you can also do it in a processed way in a logical way and you can also do it as fast as possible by using the right tools and this is what I'm about to show you in this video not only the right tools but also I'm going to show you the right places where you need um to look for information so let's take a step back here and let me show you what this graph means this is a complete process that I have spent the last weeks experimenting and putting together that will bring you from a place where you either you don't have business idea yet and you're in the process of looking for one so you will need to just start with a market a niche or an industry you interested interested in to dig into or if you already know what kind of problem you want to solve that's also good or maybe you already have either an idea or a business that is currently running but you want to know more about your customer so those one of these is your starting point and I'm going to help you here with a few resources but let me quickly go through the whole process and then I go back to the the first one second step is to go where the people are hanging out and as I told you I have listed all the different places online forums like the old good old school uh Forums on the internet cor and obviously Reddit which is the big one especially these days we are going to look at how we can very quickly access Pages like this one for example that straight away give you um exactly what you want to find so basically I have created those Google queries that you just have to put the name of your markets and it will find the threads where your customers are expressing their pain and their frustration and you just have to go there check if it's um relevant and get the data and import it in the Second Step that I'm about to show you so after online Forum we also have a social media and we have it's a little bit different process but in the end it's the same thing we want to find the right conversation that your potential customers or your customers are currently having and we want to make sure they're relevant and extract them so we can process them with AI YouTube Twitter LinkedIn of course and then we will look at communities there are plenty of conversations in communities and we will check which ones are the most relevant for you it depends a lot of your business actually and Marketplace also depending on the product also you can find a lot of relevant information here all right so we have now assuming we have gathered all this data we want to take every single source and put it in Notebook LM which I'm showing you right now this is a place where you can create cre a notebook basically where you can import all your sources so for example if I want to import a YouTube video I can import a website for example redit thread or I can import text that I have just copied and we will do that for every single source that we have found and we can upload up to 50 sources and the difference between using notebook and just copying and pasting the data in chpt or clo which I use a lot but for this specific case they are not as good because they have what we call conversation window which means they only have 200,000 tokens possible at the moment I'm I'm recording this video while the notebook LM has one and a half million tokens so you can process a lot more data at the same time than you can in ch GPT and clo that's why we use this tool and it's also made for this kind of process with a lot of data and some inputs all right I went too far already on the notebook LM I just wanted to tell you okay first we get our data then we put it in Notebook LM then we process the information in the way we want it just depend on what you want to do and I've created different prompts that you can use it's just basically copy and past that will help you to do different steps in your market research but you can do whatever you want but basically we will identify problems for example if we start with an industry which will be the the example that I'm about to show you we can identify problems and know what people in this industry are struggling with then once we have all the problems that are struggling with we can say Okay I want to struggle to to focus on this problem so what are the struggling with exactly with with this problem and then we will have all the quotes of this people expressing their frustration about this specific problem and it's like a huge list of quotes that is only relevant for a specific program that's just pure gold then once we have that we can if we want to start a business for example We can brainstorm solutions to create a business and solve the problem that we just looked at and we can finally create Persona or ideal customer profile it depend of what you want to do basically but it's like we can create marketing materials we can here go and create um value proposition headline Define the problem desired outcome core benefits everything but using all the information that we have gathered and filtered and processed and and create the M marketing material with the exact wording that the people are using to describe their problem which makes it just it's so good I I really love this process I I hope I will be able to really transfer the the excitement that I have because it's a really good one actually that's another cool one is like I create an industry glossary the example I'm going to show you here is with General Contractors and this this industry has a lot of specific Expressions that they use between themselves and as a marketer you want to talk their language and one of the first thing we can do is to create a glossary where we have we will have all the Expressions that they use and what what it means exactly and then we can use them in the marketing all right that was A8 minute introduction well done buddy all right so let's go a little bit deeper through the whole process from scratch now I told you before you need one of these things to start if you don't have anything you can just click here and go to my channel I have four videos here that you can watch that are probably helpful for you to come up with something to start with I also have put together those two resources which are function verticals and Industry verticals uh long list of industries that have generated unicorns really so you can just start from there pick one and dig into it find something interesting so this is just for you if you don't have anything any idea and you just want to start from scratch you can start with that all right now let's assume you have something and we have something since I told you we will use General Contractors as the industry threee for the example and I have already done the research and because I was able to find interesting information I wanted to use the same example so the video is more relevant because you can see what happens when you find actual information about a specific industry so the first thing we want to do is actually to create our notebook in Notebook LM so I have created it here but I haven't gave it a name so example simp Le General Contractors all right now this tool let me make it a little bit smaller on the left side you have the sources and every time you click the plus icon you can add a source then here you have a chat you can talk with it and you also have the notebook guide and in the notebook guide you can even create a podcast and that's basically what made this tool viral but in my opinion this tool is way better than only the podcast option even though it's cool but what we are going to do with this schol is worth way more than creating a podcast anyway that's not the point my point is I have my notebook now I'm going to look for sources all right let's start by online forums okay on the internet you have those old school forums and they are everywhere this is not like Reddit or cor it's they are everywhere in different website but they are still really interesting so what we want to do is use this kind of Google queries we use Google and in most of the case every time you see the green here it means that I'm basically using Google as a database Google already knows all the website there is and the basic search on Google gives you nothing basically if you want want to have something interesting then you need to tell exact Google exactly what you want and that's what I did here so for example here I say okay that's my market so here you put for example general contractor and it says okay in url you will have that so in the address and and then we will look for all those terms I think I feel I was I have been I experienced my experience my opinion all those terms that should have people are actually sharing their point of view their opinion that will give us more relevant data let me click here this is this every time you have the example it's basically this query with general contractor as a niche so if I click here then I can see that I start having a few things that are interesting general contractor agreements general contractor on or handson owner mhm well okay so let's assume you go there and you start looking at it you want to see if it's relevant for what you are looking at and here let me just read quickly okay this one doesn't seem that relevant because it's someone working for General general contractor it's not a general contractor basically general contractor responsibilities all right let's have a look at this one yeah yeah sure okay so that's a discussion a conversation it's way too old and you will see that this is most of the time that's the problem you will face with this old forums so I just put it here but I actually don't really like to use it but I just wanted you to know that okay there is not only Reddit and chora and and social media you also have plenty of websites with conversation and depending on the program you're you can dig into this conversation and find really good insights so let's move on to the next one we have Kora and if I check the example here this will happen to you frequently is because once you start getting giving too complicated uh requirement to Google it really thinks you all but so you just have to say no I'm not a bot and now you can see all the cor question answer I don't know how we call that for cor that talk about general contractor and have in the body all the terms that we have seen I have already checked it and I know that in Kora for the specific Niche we don't find relevant information because this is more people that are struggling with General Contractors and people that are answering on how it works but it's not like General Contractors that are struggling with their own problem basically so that also tells you that not every source is relevant for every industry you need to go through all of them and to understand if it is relevant or not for you now let's look at one that is relevant I know it already it's Reddit so if I click here you could also just go on Reddit and find communities and but I figure that Google is a way better search engine for Reddit than Reddit is and I talked a lot about tools to understand Reddit and they are good when you want to ideate but if you want to look for something specific Google is just is awesome so here now I have a lot of interesting data wanting to become a general Constructor in the future okay problem with my general contractor no that's not false what to expect during an interview with a large I'm a terrible contractor okay let me just close all of that and I will keep only the good ones here uh how did you become a general contractor moving conversation I had a 70y old general contractor that's could be interesting what is your life and day to-day like as a general contractor that's good I'm misled about pyramids and it's too far in now don't know what it means life as a general contractor you could also check how many comments there is the general if they're ranking on Google it's it means that they are somehow relevant and they have some kind of Engagement okay let me just go through that quickly and select a few okay I picked I don't know three four five 6 S 8 nine 10 11 threads that I think are really relevant if you are not recording a YouTube video but you are actually making research you are better off reading understanding because I didn't mention that but everything we do is not preventing you from understanding your customer right the whole point is to understand your customer better better than they understand themselves and to solve their problem so you need to read you need to understand but what we can do is process the data a lot faster I close the parenthesis here all right so now I want to pick the link and then I want to go in my notebook add source and I am using website for this one I insert here here move on to the second one get the link do it again plus opsite then the third one take Link close website all right let me finish and I get you back when I'm done all right I'm done importing the sources all the ready threads and you can check out every sources separately and as you can see here I have a quick summary then I have the actual post and then I have all the comments from the post for Reddit when you just use the website Source it really gets all the data exactly how you want so that's just awesome to use a notebook LM and redit together but we don't want to have only Reddit to be honest sometimes you can only find one platform you don't have to do all of them if you find something that is relevant then just go for it and don't spend forever to find more data that are useless but in for the purpose of this video I want to show you every single place you can search in YouTube YouTube is a little bit different between because we don't want to use the YouTube thing actually because when you use the YouTube link it actually takes the transcript of the we do so it's for studying understanding topics uh but what we are interesting in as marketers as Market researcher is comments because this is where people are talking about their problems but they only talk about their problems if the video is relevant so it's not like you just need a video about the niche you need a video that make people talk about what they are experimenting and also that make the right people talk about that so again we have a Google query I love to do that so you can see it and now it only shows up videos where somehow you have a chance that people are expressing their pain and problems you can also simply Open YouTube and type for example General contractor and look at the title and decide for yourself this is just um a shortcut basically and here you also want to have enough views so you have enough comments and you don't know exactly how many comments you have looking at Google but you want to pick one where you know that you have some materials to work with I think a lot of people okay so I checked this video by the way the I think visual is just awesome so so good and this one is actually pretty good so we have 200 comments the title of the video is being a general contractor what it actually it's actually like so experiment experimented guy is explaining what it is to be a contractor a general contractor so you guess you bet that a lot of actual contractors would watch that rely on some things that it says and share the experience for me that's the perfect one and what we want is simply to get the comments and hly there is a very easy way to do it there are Chrome apps and whatever stuff um you can find on the interet but for me the easiest way is just to copy and tast so I'm just going to scroll down and down you don't have to take them all right uh you can stop at some point you just side when you start okay so now I'm copying everything yep it's a little bit long okay now cish and I open this one notebook LM and this time it's past text so here YouTube video so just so he knows that YouTube video comments and then I can past everything and as you can see I already have all the data now which is mean is that I have BD IQ which is a Chrome app which add a little bit of useless text which you don't have to have but we have the most important thing all right insert I'm doing it only for one but you can do it for several ones if you want now we move on to the next one which is Twitter and Twitter is a little bit complicated because they are really careful that you can't do exactly what I showed you with Google with YouTube you can't do that on Twitter you can't copy a lot of a lot of comments so there is a work around let's see if we I can show you so the first thing you want to do is to click here on the link I put which will bring you to the search advanced advanced search basically it's the same thing we do with Google but now it's within Twitter and to make sure that you find the right thing that you want basically I will use general contractor here as you can see I turn it already and we will just use this list of words any of this words and then search and now it will pull up some relevant post contractor are in a blood bu right now here's the hamster wheel we go through often I think that's quite relevant and we we also have another 200 comments a bunch of views if we go down specific things that I look for When selecting a general contractor fair enough not as much engagement though um I just heard from a general contractor friends in Los Angeles a vacant home he was doing construction and received hundred of ballots how is possible not relevant all right let's stick to you can see that you find good and bad you you have to judge let's go on this one this one is actually really cool here if I start to actually copy I can copy but my copy will only take like the last 10 comments so that's not cool that's not what we want the only way I have is I was checking for some Chrome extension I found this one per it's a French one by do way and but is it's a paid one you have to if you want to upload to take more than um I think it's 150 comments then you have to upgrade it's like 11 EUR per month if you are building a business I think it's a fair enough investment um but you can also use it for free and in the end you end up with a CSV file with all the comments and I'm going to import just the cssv file that I have exported previously I actually don't know if I can add this csb file let's see no so I told you something wrong we can't actually use a CSV file so basically what you need to do is once you have exported them you need to open the CSV file let's do it right away new then I'm going to import it here all right so I just imported the file you can see them here now I can just copy that and I will import it as a text close text so Twitter comments how many do I have yeah that's enough that's cool all right let's move on to the next one so we have found something interesting on Twitter on X sorry now we have LinkedIn I again um came up with a query although it's not that fancy um you're probably better off just scrolling and finding the right people as you can see I've tested them all I didn't find anything really relevant on LinkedIn it's more like companies bragging about the what the aesome things that they have done so we are just going to skip it but I'm not explaining you how you can find something on on Lin but you can have some help using that example also you can use oh yeah the let me no I actually have something to show you here let me one second okay if you just click here that's another Chrome extension oh that that's a shame because it says that it won't be available soon because it doesn't respect the rules that would be a shame because it's a very good one it's here and it just it works on LinkedIn so once you are in the on the post like that you can just copy here open the extension and now most of the time most of the it will take the comments sometimes it won't Whatever you can always try this extension if it works that's good otherwise you still can copy and add as a text but we are not going to do it for the sake of this video um you have seen how we can find data on LinkedIn okay now we are coming to communities it's a little bit more complicated because communities are very specific and not everybody hangs out on commun I figured that actually School posts are ranking on Google which is cool for the public communities which means we also have an example that is not working that's awesome okay let me make it work so I copy here and then I will put it here let's go back and change general contractors all right now it works and I will just change that you have the right example where was I yeah if you dig a little bit into it you realize that I don't think contractors are actually hanging out on school so that's why we don't have anything interesting here but depend if you in the gaming industry in the marketing industry then you will find people that are on school you can also use of course School discovery which is the basic way you just open school and then you search for Community that's it now you have Discord Discord is actually really hard to find communities on Discord for discords like Facebook group and Linkedin you still can use this tool which I don't know how up to date it is but basically if I do General contractors you will see that they are not really hanging out on communities but I tested for several topics and and you can find some it's all mixed up I don't know how relevant it is I let you judge of that but for I found kind of a hack to find Discord servers again using Google I'm asking Google to show me all the YouTube videos that have a Discord Link in the description and actually I don't know why my links are not working it's so annoying wait here I think I need to do like gaming for example yeah because I tested for contractor and there is absolutely no one uh but if you go on an industry that is using uh Discord then you can find some Discord server like that but honestly finding the good Discord server is really hard the whole point here is that once you find communities where your people are hanging out in then you look for the best conversations and then you copy and pass I just want to point out something we are going to arrive at the end I just have Amazon to show you and then we will start processing the data that we just gathered but the result you will have here only depends on the quality of the input that you have here so if you just put everything together then don't expect something awesome that's why it's not completely automated it still requires you to be the judge of what's good what's relevant and what will help you to generate ideas and marketing messages and whatever things you want to process okay last one now Amazon I quickly show I I just realized I missed the I forgot to add the prompt or it's not a prompt actually a query but same thing we have query for Amazon and in this case it will take mostly books uh depending on your topic it could be if you're in Ecommerce probably it will take if you talking about something solvable with a physical product maybe we have different products but here for example um it's time to think like general contractor no the ultimate formula for winning works with general contracting contractors okay four ratings so that's not good enough for us we want something with a lot of ratings and something that is relevant as usual so in this case I won't pick one but you get the point if you go on Amazon some people would share their thought about a book about something and this is relevant for you to U create a solution for whatever program all right we are done with the step two we have now imported um bunch of different sources in our notebook and we are going to start processing everything now I'm just closing all the windows here and we are going to look at the different prompts that we have first I want to identify a program context I have gathered oh I have gathered Ro markets research data from varus online sources about a market I am exploring please analyze this data to identify key problems and opportunities as a market research analyst special blah blah blah and I want this output so I want title of the progr that def found I want how many time to know how many time it what mentioned in my sources so I can see which one is the more frequent I want urgency and impact like how hard is the program for the people that are experimenting it I want a search query and that is what would these people look for on Google to solve their problem so I can double check on Google with this specific program and I want just this one is just describing the program and the most important is I want a few quotes of the people talking about this program and I just have to do to copy that then I go to chat pass the prompt and let it run and see how it goes normally it's not too long it's not chptr Cloud it's appears right away although it it has a lot of data to process actually I don't know how long it will take maybe I'm going to watch this camera for a long time ah here we go let me go back to the very first one problem one finding and managing reli sorry reliable subcontractors plus 10 plus mentions it's not always accurate but at least it says okay this one has a lot of mentions high impact High urgency search query reliable subcontractor finding good subcontractor from construction if you think this is something people will look for on Google you just copy that and double check I don't think it's relevant in our context because there are not that many subcontractors so we won't have a lot of data all right so description General Contractors he on on subcontractors for various aspect of construction project finding reliable skilled subcontractors who delivers quality work on time and within budget is recurring challenge managing this relationship effective is also crucial for project success and here I'm not going to read that but you can see what happened at the time I did not understand you can see that those are actually subcontractors talking about this specific problem now we have problem two managing C client expectation and communication eight mentions impact High urgency high as well same problem explanation the search keyword and the quotes and then you have another one burnout stress and you have accurate pricing in bing that's true that's a rare one I was in construction before so I I know that lack of organization in system that's definitely one all right so we have a few problems here and now this is for you to decide what you want to do with it and the next step in the process will assume that you you want you find one that you again just a step back I'm sorry if you already have a business then this is you don't want to identify a program if you already have a solution so you can skip to the next step right away but also it's always interesting to to learn about your customers so let's assume you defined a program and in our case we are going to take this one finding and managing reliable subcontractor as the example as the program we want to dig in so I'm just taking it here and for the sake of Simplicity I'm just pasting here so it basically says that's the program we are investing so I just pasted it here extract all relevant mention of the program to understand its various manifestations and impact on users it's not users actually it's a people whatever your market research your mission and then I give some instruction of our formatting and that's it but now after have looked into all different programs we ask notebook LM to jimy to tell us specifically what's happening for one single program okay and reliability and incompetence of subcontractors and now we have we are all of that is talking about subcontractors but in subcontractors you have different variation of the program and for each of them there are a lot of quotes my biggest struggle is how unreliable people are which I then have to own up because I am the general subcontractor the general contractor I once had to tell one of my Subs that's a spec specific word not to smoke in an elementary school why I've had Subs again talk back to clients walk out from jobs who does that and we can see all the general contractors that are expressing their pain about their subcontractors and that if you want to find a to build a solution for general contractors to manage the to find good subcontractors then this is go because from that you can create your marketing material I'm not going to continue reading because I know it's a little bit painful so let's move on to the next one now I want to brainstorm solution again it's assuming you don't know exactly you don't have a business yet so you want to find something and here I just repeat everything just to make sure so general contractor problem investigated I think let me okay so what do we have we have collected detailed data about a specific prr our goal is to generate different types of potential solution as a product and business strategist specializing in innovating solution design that's very fancy actually uh by the way I use AI to create the prompts so I'm guiding AI to generate this complete prompt and specifically Cloe to do that it's the best iPhone but in the end I ask AI to create a prompt I run get the output and give feedback on the output I got so I get a new prompt run it again until I get the right output every time I I run the prompt so that's why sometimes it seems I didn't write it I didn't actually it's it's a okay so now take let's take that one and enter okay Solution One subcontractor vetting and Management Service cor concept this service would provide General Contractors with a reliable source of prev subcontractor it would also offer tools and resources to help manage your subcontractor's relationship and project that's the broad solution I'm not going to continue read that because I find that this is not extremely relevant and let me tell you why here I put Cloe and this is exactly because of what we are seeing now notebook LM I couldn't find exactly what llm is using but I guess it's the the small version of Gin not the complete one and as much as it is fast and can process a lot of data it's not as good as cloud or GPT 4 or 01 to for reasoning which means when you say identify programs least quote the specific the people for specific program it just finds just have to data when you start saying brainstorm Solutions it's quite limited so in this case if I would need to brainstorm Solutions then I would get what I got here this one I think is is extremely valuable and then I would go into cloud and use this prompt to brainstorm solution and cloud is way better to do that that's it so I'm just moving on to the next step because here I just wanted to show you you can do it here if you don't want to waste time or if you don't have a subscription to CL or to chpt but you can do it here also I didn't show you something which is that in Notebook LM you can save the note so now I have it here and I can choose for example I can remove the sources here and I can select this one and it will take only it will work only about on that that's not what we want I just wanted to show you that you can do that also be very careful on Notebook LM if I refresh the page here I lose the chat it's good to know so that's why you want to save as not the things that you find valuable all right let's move on to the next one create Persona icps quick break here a Persona is a person an ICP is a company generally in b2c if you have a b2c SI an app consumer app then you will think in Persona a general generally so it's a person that's experimenting some kind of situation that has some thing that they want to do and an ICP is for B2B and they are thinking of okay what kind of company could we serve the best ideal customer Prof uh and within the ICP you also have personal which are the people in this company who are they that we want to Target so here I've tried to create a prom that would fit a little bit of everything you can make it so much better but actually this one at least would give you depending of if your idea your program you want to solve is B2B or b2c it will choose one or the other and it will also think of the job to be done um not going to go into that but that's a framework for marketing people hire a product to do a job um so it it will tell you exactly the the job it thinks uh it does so let's just do it quickly because as usual I wanted do a small video and I end up doing a long video general contractor unra sub subcontractor and yeah that's what we want okay here okay it just makes me saying before I get into that something else that I didn't show you is that the cool thing is you always always have the quotes So if I click here then it will show me exactly where it found this information so every time you see a little number it means that you can go on the source where I found the information and find the source basically anyway subcontractor rating and writing platform understanding the general contractor job to be done when I need to hire a subcontractor for project help me quickly find and assess TR for that is not good it's not good at all anyway you get the the principle it just it makes you think of your personal but again I would do the exact same thing as I told you before I would take all my information and I would go to clo and give the same exact prompt to create ICP and personels and think of the job to be done because it's so much better for reasoning and creating I am not I'm going to skip this one because this one is the same as this one I will do something and I will tell you no it's not relevant you should go to Cloud but basically if you want to have another prompts just to create value proposition headlines PR definition start generating some marketing material if you want just to Kickstart and to test something very fast the one I want to show you though is this one and I think it's really cool let me just copy and past and tell you afterward what it does I'm posing by the way in between because it always takes quite a long time all right for some reason this one has taken so long actually I know it's because uh in the prompt I say I want a very complete list U maybe it could be a little bit smaller but let's look at this it's huge it's actually huge so here you will basically have the the wording that the general Constructors are using between them and that they understand between them so remember we were talking about Subs short for subcontractor what do we have interesting complex cust build so gcpm General Contractors project manager you can get basically like a list of the exact word that you will use in your marketing all right so we arrive at the end of this video honestly it took me a while and at the beginning I didn't know how to present it I didn't know if I explained first how to use Google queries if I make a video about the different places on the internet if I make a video about notebook LM I decided to make one where I show the whole thing um and maybe if if there are pieces of this video you would like to dig more into let me know in the comments I have plenty of other video on different topics and right now I'm thinking of covering different things vertical AI agents Reddit marketing that I'm I'm interesting interested in so so many things but I just wanted this one to be done because I know it's useful knowledge that hopefully you and a lot of people will take use and create cool things to add value in our world and to build a life for themselves so I really hope you like this video if you do please like it and tell me in the comment because then it will push it to more people and then my work don't say and seen and I haven't spent all these weeks working on that for nothing so please and comment on this video and I see you in the next one bye-bye
