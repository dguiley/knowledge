# Why We Built and Donated the Model Context Protocol

In this episode, [Guest's Name] discusses the motivations and implications behind creating the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-source initiative now managed by the Linux Foundation.

## Core Thesis
The episode presents MCP as a solution for seamlessly integrating diverse AI models into applications and workflow tools. By promoting standardization akin to USB-C, MCP addresses the challenge of isolated language models, facilitating better real-world utility and collaboration. The open-source approach encourages community contributions, setting a robust foundation for future innovation.

## Key Insights
- MCP bridges the gap between AI models and user-dependent tools like email and cloud services, reducing developmental redundancies.
- Open-source development is essential for fostering innovation, drawing from open science principles to enhance transparency and collaborative growth.
- Partnering with the Linux Foundation ensures that MCP remains a trustworthy standard within the tech ecosystem.
- Engagement with major industry players and the broader developer community enhances the protocol's adoption and practical relevance.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Organizations should adopt MCP to streamline AI integration across platforms and increase productivity.
2. Embrace open-source methodologies to leverage collective expertise and improve technology standards.
3. Actively partake in community-driven development to benefit from diverse contributions and maintain system security.

## Notable Quotes
> "What MCP tries to accomplish is giving this like brain that you have... really the limbs into the world."

> "We understood the value of doing this as open source... we know this needs to be an open ecosystem."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
- Wilde Agency can deploy MCP to enhance AI-driven applications, ensuring compatibility with diverse tools without bespoke integrations.
- Adoption of open-source development principles can lead to more agile and innovative project executions within the agency.
- Engaging with the MCP community may offer insights into cutting-edge AI applications, providing strategic advantages in client work.
