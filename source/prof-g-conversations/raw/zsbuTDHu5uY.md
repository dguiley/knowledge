the general advice I give to young men versus young women and it goes like this so one for men be the guy you'd want to date and two for women give it a chance I think the essence of what you're saying is spoton I would package it a little bit differently we're finally seeing a lot of women realizing their potential in a way that we hadn't previously I'm not suggesting we go back to the 1900s I'm just saying men haven't kept pace with women the last 30 years that's just the reality of it [Music] Le me where does this podcast find you I am in my apartment in Brooklyn well of course you are of course of course you are where else would I be yeah of course all the cool kids all right so let's bust right into it you've been observing the ways modern relationships have changed for quite some time now can you walk us through how you ended up researching this field sure um well it was probably like back in like 2009 um I was a bartender for most of my life and then I was a brand strategist so that's kind of the two sort of you know different parts of my life that merged and I was sort of watching how online dating was changing people and this is like before Tinder but I mean you could already see the effects happening so I started mapping out the timelines of people who met offline like met in person and then um I was mapping out the moments of what happened when people you know met online and they were completely different and so it's not that you know meeting people online was like wrong or that it shouldn't happen it's just that we were starting to lose the I would almost call it like a category of relationships that sort of forms over time and over moments and so those two weren't lining up and so I noticed that and I think just like somewhere in my in my gut I was like you know there's going to be a lot of good things that probably happened from online dating and and this industry and there's probably going to be a lot of not so good things that happen and uh I was sort of keeping track of those let's double click on that and I I'll give you I'm fascinated by what I'll call the The Mating market and generally um speaking what the observations I've gleaned is that if you talk to couples in their 60s and 70s almost all of them will say one was more interested than the other or one wasn't interested in the other in the beginning so uh online dating is pretty you know two-dimensional it's the person's appearance and then some kind of Topline cliffnotes about what I'll call controlled boasting and bullet points and people make an assumption on if they like them or not and that's it whereas when you're at work with someone when someone approaches you at a bar or a softball league or a church or nonprofit you're you're hit with not whether whether I want to mate with this person but you start an interaction some sort of social interaction and smell Vibe humor and maybe you decide I don't want I'm not romantically interested in this person but then you see them give a PowerPoint presentation you think wow she's really smart I like her body language or you say you get to know a guy and you think he's I like the way he treats his parents and love at first sight is just not that common but people do fall in love and so what we've what abson has said unless it's love at first sight it's not going to happen and also that it dramatically skews favor or seeds Advantage for men to women because men are much less choosy I think women have much a much finer filter for mating because just anthropologically the downside of sex and pregnancy is much greater for them than it is for a man and that this has resulted in this massive mating inequality where it's much much you know the top 10% of men get a disproportionate amount of the interest and uh U essentially it's leaked value or currency I don't even know if it's leaked from men to women I'll say it's definitely made it worse for men so a lot there can you respond to where I got it right and wrong there yeah um it's made it worse for everyone in different you know um the thing that I hear you saying and I I think you're you're right is what what online dating did is it made everyone really really dependent on whether or not there was an like a very quick spark an immediate spark and nobody really had the chance to simmer anymore and so the other thing is that when you when you spend time on the apps and again I I I think a lot of people think I'm anti-app I'm not anti-app I am anti- apps being the dominant form and the way that every you should do it all right I mean put it into the mix you should put it be the only thing but I think what's what's hard right now is there just aren't as many places and so you know what I was trying to do you know back in the day I actually did events and I did all these different sort of experiments to see like if I changed the order in which people learned about each other the information that they were given about each if I change that change that order how would that change the trajectory of the relationship and how would that change how people got to know each other could I slow them down could I just slow everybody down from the sort of snap judgments and more importantly what what you're describing which I think is correct is when you spend a lot of time on an app that the side of you that is the shallowest most consumer focused side is the one that comes out so one one of the things I had people do as I said like while you're swiping I want you to talk out loud you know kind of share your internal dialogue with me and as you can imagine people were like I am horrified that this is what I'm saying and this is not how I want to be and this isn't like the kind of person I would be out in the world and it's not just the dating apps it's also the culture of dating how people advise each other and how people talk about each other it's like oh if you like why would you why would you go on go out with someone three times oh you're not feeling a spark you should move on so there is the dating apps Scott but then there's also this bigger way that we talk about how people are supposed to feel and how quickly they're supposed to feel it yeah I like I love the research around um you know think verbalize what you're thinking so I'll put forward another thesis I'm I'm sure you get asked a lot I I get it's I get a lot of emails asking for advice um it's usually professional advice and then it's around things like business school or moving what I call lifestyle and I get a lot of people who ask me for dating advice and I give I don't mean to you need to ask questions before you give good advice but I'll I'll be reductive here and because I do bifurcate the the general advice I give to young men versus young women and it goes like this and again I'm very open to coaching here with young men I tell them essentially men are metaphorically something like 50% of women say they want dat a GU shorter than them I believe it's I believe it's greater than that it's just an embarrassing thing to say it makes you sound unkind but metaphorically men are getting shorter and shorter fewer are going to college um they're not maturing as quickly as they used to which is strange they're not socializing as much um and they are becoming less economically emotionally viable and some they're just less attractive to women and what I tell young men is okay it's not about finding the right person it's about becoming the right person and then putting yourself in a place to meet somebody but you know what is your plan professionally and economically physically without having your mom or a girlfriend nag at you to iron your shirt and take a shower and get in shape and all that stuff are you doing that are you finding interests that make you a more interesting person and then we can talk about putting you in a situation but you want to be the person you'd want to date and I basically tell young men you need to get your together and I take time out of their phone I ask them to give me their screen time and we reinvest it in um I call it money muscle and relationships and I say with women okay um I find the advice I give to them is I don't want to say lower your standards but be open to the notion that a second coffee on someone that you maybe didn't love but didn't turn you off might be a good investment and the reason why is I believe that media and Tik Tok are essentially constantly feeding women with this notion of you deserve better leave that guy or you can have it all and it creates a set of expectations whether they're realistic or not what they do is they lower they they reduce the time Horizon that you're willing to engage and give a potential relationship and opportunity so one for men be the guy you'd want to date and two for women give it give it a chance so I think the essence of what you're saying is spoton I would package it a little bit differently um so let's start with what you said about um women and okay so I know you know the I've heard you say before the the Chris Williamson thing like you know men are getting shorter and you know women are getting taller is that what usually say yeah yeah the he of the high heels effect yeah okay so here's what I'd say I I I completely appreciate that framing I I understand it it's it's very provocative I don't know if it's always useful because I would say did women get taller or were women finally allowed to grow in the past few decades is that what's happened that we're we're finally seeing their we're finally seeing a lot of women realizing their potential in a way that we hadn't previously so but that's a so that's a societal statement whatever the reason is women are more e more single women own homes and single men now which is a wonderful thing it's so I'm not I'm not suggesting we go back to the 1900s I'm just saying men haven't kept paced with women the last 30 years that's just the reality of it right sometimes that framing can seem a little bit adversarial what I would love to see is both in in in this framework like both people sort of appreciate the other gender more and so you said something about like women wanting to you know like kind of lowering their standards and I guess what I would say to that is I would say a little bit I think there is this idea that you know both men and women should in some ways be going out and like trying to find some sort of like the right person or the perfect person and so what I tell people of like instead of thinking about like lowering your standards like create your standards like what do you what what is it that is truly valuable to you in a relationship as opposed to what you think is like the right guy or the good enough person or you know the the achievement I think there's a lot of like um this idea that I should achieve a relationship I should get like this this thing that you know is like a a trophy or a prize out there and um in terms of like the height thing and I think I said this to you before I know that you know people people say that and I think part of what the apps do is they Prime people to care about things that aren't actually as important once you get to know somebody so the more that you get to know somebody the less you may be hung up on something like that um and then I think I do you have so I just want to do you have any research on that because I find that that that's aspirational I'd like to believe that's true the data I've seen does not bear that out that the the dating apps the dating I'll just give you one piece of data the stuff I've seen is that ay who's 62 is is as attractive and has as much success everything normalized a guy who's 6'2 who makes I think $60,000 is as attractive as a guy who's 5'8 who makes 120 so you have to be substantially more uh professionally and economically successful if you're substantially shorter that height is still um you know incredibly important at least on the IAL impression yeah and that's where I'm I'm agreeing with you and what I'm what I'm saying is like on if that's the information that you're presented with and you're going to wait that more importantly right if you're on an app and most people spend time on apps so the when they're making those decisions height will Factor importantly and what I'm saying is like when I'm when I do I talk to tons of people um that have met you know both offline and online and I have lots of stories of people who you know if they met someone in context then height wasn't as important to them right so height becomes more important when we have fewer venues to get to know someone and um so so go back to the framing again A Better Way Around the notion that around the the the high heels effect that there's a better frame so I I want to acknowledge that it's great and we can celebrate that women have made progress um my sense though is that as they have registered that progress their talent pool or the potential pool of mates in their eyes has shrunk because women made socioeconomically horizontally and up men horizontally and down and because there are fewer and fewer people horizontally and up um that there's just fewer quotequote viable men in the eyes of women I mean one thing I whenever I ask I hear a lot about people say I have a friend she's wonderful and and you know I hear this all the time she's attractive she's interesting she's professionally successful can't find a guy and my response is she can find a guy she just can't find a guy she wants to date and that there is just this this Chasm if you will in I don't know expectations and you can you can't say to a woman lower your standards I guess the question is are we going to wait for men is it is it about third spaces is it about where where do you see this all kind of playing out cuz I'm worried that we see household formation going down we see birth rates going down we see depression and anxiety going up I think men in their 20s it registers I think the lack of mating opportunities really hits men hard in their 20s I think they lose a lot of self-esteem and they kind of sequester from society women are much better my senses at maintaining social relationships finding places to receive and give love without necessarily a lot of romantic relationships guys are not good at it where I see it begin to impact a woman's life as she goes into her 30s and starts to leave her childbearing years and is disappointed that that part of her life gets shut out or is no longer an option and that weighs on her and so what I see is a lot of loneliness and a lot of unhappiness and I'm just trying to figure out and by the way I love the fact that you're doing these events I think that's wonderful I think I think the government should literally pay pay you to do this I I think that's why I feel so differently about this I think just because I've done so much on the like you know um boots on the ground research as opposed to like you know that I've I feel like I've just I've witnessed so many different um scenarios and I completely understand and agree with what you're saying you know online dating and all this stuff it's exacerbated all of the extremes that you're talking about the the side of them that shops on Amazon the side of them that is a you know a very astute cons consumer they're bringing that same side when they're on the app and that's actually the opposite that's like the the version of you that you don't want on there and you were saying something about um men and you know kind of feeling a little bit you know dejected and you know and I also spend a lot of time talking to genen Z men because they're very important to my my research too um is that I know there's this idea that you have to be like this you know High achiever or you know physic you know physically tall or something the the thing that I always saw with women again in my events when I kind of slowed the process down is a lot of people what they're what they're looking for is someone who is striving right they and and I I think that's captured in what you're talking about it's not necessarily it's this idea of like you are reaching you have't you you're reaching into the future and you feel compelled by that future and that driving could be physical it could be you know professional it could be like you know um something that you're trying to learn a craft that you're trying to master and I think when people see a person striving that is incredibly compelling that is incredibly attractive the other um some of the other or another thesis I'm curious to get your response to is I find America becomes more like itself every day and that is it is a generous loving place if you have money it's a rapacious violent place if you didn't have money when I was young and dating you know we we all kind of making decent money but if we pulled it together you know my girlfriend we pulled our money together we had an apartment we were building a life together I wasn't making a lot of money but it didn't really matter that much we had kind of a similar life to everybody else it felt like everybody was sort of kind of middle class and and now there's such a variance in people's income and money can buy so much now and so the the life that money offers in America now is the gulf between the life that money someone with money can have versus someone who doesn't have money creates an environment where the amount of money you have especially as a guy actually I'd say only as a guy my the stuff I've seen is that men don't really care if a woman has money they care if she has her act together and she has professional interest but they don't really care about my senses the stuff I've read whereas it's becoming so important for women that they naturally gravitate older because the assumption is that person is going to have more money what are your thoughts okay I have a couple thoughts on that one is what people really want um when you when you really really break it down is yes of course people are drawn to people that have you know money or in in their in their mind resources and stability is is the is the deeper need but let's be specific I'm saying I'm not saying people I'm saying women are drawn to men with more resources okay so I'll I'll talk then about women because I I am that is who I'm referring to um what you really want is someone who is resourceful with what they have like you can you can see how much money someone has but what's really attractive is someone's philosophy of money and how they interact with it and how they how they you know like how it's like a part of their identity and I think that that piece has kind of gotten lost because of the transactional nature of dating right now whereas I think you you are correct people just look at the headlines does this person have money does this person have not not have money what people I think are actually drawn to is like someone's relationship to money as opposed to how much money they have we'll be right back we've been talking about young people and older people want relationships as well and with somewhere between 45 and 55% of marriages ending in divorce and people getting married later you've done a lot of work uh that focuses on the later dater which I I hope you've I hope you registered and trademarked that I did I did oh good for you um walk us through who that is and the challenges they face and how the Dynamics and the atmospherics are different there I just sort of noticed that so much of like dating advice and dating content was very centered on the 20 or 30s something who is mostly trying to you know secure commitment and it was always it was almost like a little bit rushed like you know you got to figure out very quickly if this person is the right person and then move on and then it kind of jumped to like the the Golden Era you know the the people that were um in the much later years and I just felt like this middle group was not really being looked at very closely and so I really wanted to to dig in and understand like how is dating in this in this period different what are the ADV manages and also it's a very interesting group of people because it's primarily um it's primarily Gen X a lot of the people that I work with this is their first time getting on a dating app you know in their in their 40s or 50s or in some cases like their their early 60s and so their wiring is fundamentally different um and so it's very interesting to think about what not only how their wiring is different but also what you want from a relationship in this sort of second chapter how is that different from what you wanted in the first and I mean I think of Gen X is um I I'm I'm Gen X actually I'm I'm right on the edge what I call CU I'm a narcissist thank you for that but I always describe it as you know when I talk about the way I hover over my kids I would leave my mom's house my mom single single mother at 10: a. on a Sunday with a Schwin bike with a banana seat and a card that made that rumbling sound that playing card I would put in the back of the spokes and then an Ababa bar and 35 cents and I might be home 14 hours later I mean she just had and so I was more independent I think I was a little bit more resourceful I think I was a little bit more resilient and I think those paid dividends for me later in life when it came to work and dating Etc how does Gen X approach dating what advice would you have for them uh in contrast to the advice you give to younger people it's interesting because um they're dating on the app so in some ways they're dating on this platform that wasn't necessarily meant for them but that's what they have to use too I think the the interesting thing about this group of people also dating at this point in their life is don't necessarily go straight for the commitment which you know kind of sounds counterintuitive but this is a period of life where people are in many ways what's the most important to them is actually like connection and a degree of curiosity right they're in many ways exploring new identities like what is what is attractive to them now and so I I always sort of ask people to like take a step back and say okay like this is sort of how you dated in your 20s and 30s but what do you what do you want now um because it actually might be different it seems to me that young people on the wrong end of this technology Revolution is is it as bad worse not as bad uh for for Gen xers for later daters no I think they're experiencing a lot of the same frustrations I think what I want them to to realize is that because of in some ways like their pre-app wiring that they like I really want to embolden them to use the apps but to also use a lot of the sides of them that were forged before the apps so I think there's a little a little bit more patience a little bit more you know able to um you know sit through awkwardness a little bit more um like references and life experience and just a little bit more you know stuff that they can tap into and really connect on let's talk a little bit about the lgbtq market am I um someone who works at prop G um had a had a great point it's one of those things where it hit me in the face I'm like Jesus Christ I'm so toned of and I was saying that men need to approach strangers in a bar and that's a skill we have to teach people in Ming to approach strangers in a bar and express romantic interest while making them feel safe and she said that doesn't that doesn't work for gay women gay gay women can't go in you know unless it's a gay bar can't necessarily there's just a different level of risk of rejection or a very awkward situation for a gay woman approaching another woman and you know out in the wild so to speak and I thought God I didn't even think of that and then I thought maybe that is really that is one place where online dating has been a really strong positive is it can find people you know outside of what you call the the normal Z wrong word but the bulk of the market such that they cannot waste time they can be a little bit more efficient what do you see in terms of dating in the lgbtq market how it's changed I'm not as familiar with that market but I think everyone has you know said that it's it's brought you know a lot of positive things to the lgbtq community but just like the this is where there's there's a lot of overlap is the same thing is that I think with the speed and the volume and the amount of choices like that is that's going to scramble anyone as we wrap up here is there any oh Scott can we talk about AI oh I'd love that yeah talk about AI yes Ai and dating is here sometimes as an overlay so that's already here right you can use AI to tweak your pictures to write your profile to um do the back and forth messaging and then there's AI as a replacement for a companion that is you know something that is going to be on people's doorstep if it isn't already I know that there are some benefits to it but I just I really want people to understand whether that's something that they want in their lives and and and why I'll paint the glass half empty you painted half full to wrap up on talk about you know third places or how we improve things I am the wrong word is freaked out but I am hugely concerned that the advances in AI are going to convince men who endure some initial rejection or don't have confidence or don't have economic opportunities to regress to uh a much more utile rewarding lowrisk low entry form of porn known as Ai and they're going to start having relationships with Aid driven algorithms and sex dos never develop the skills just fall off the map romantically and sexually and never develop the skills to have a relationship and that they'll just sequester from society and unfortunately with men when they don't have the prospect of a romantic or sexual relationship usually all their other relationships wilt and that we're just going to have this generation of men trading crypto playing video games and having sex with dolls and I just find it just so incredibly depressing your turn what I want is I want people to be like conscious of consumers in this because everything that you just said is is a a very very real possibility what you painted is is pretty dark the way that I kind of see how AI and dating could play out would be you know something like how we see a stationary bike like right we've all accepted that there's a stationary bike at the gym and it's not real but it's a place to you know have a a you know a sanitized safe experience but you miss out on a lot of things when that's the only form of of biking that you know so I think that there could be you know and there are there's a lot of stuff out there that there are a lot of UPS sides like people are getting a a lot of you know positive having a positive therapeutic experience you know with with AI companions but I'm I'm absolutely with you what like my concern is is that such a big part of the human experience is being in relationship it is experiencing disappointment heartbreak and all of the all of the great things that come with a relationship so much of what it means to be human is to be in relationship with someone that you know can choose to leave you or stay with you and an AI cannot do that an AI has to be with you yeah as long as your credit card
