# Reverse Organic Strategy Blew My Mind

Published: 2024-12-19

and here's the key there's something better than handling objections is to find the belief that's underneath the objection and to completely remove the belief I'm always asking this question you how can we find out if this works sooner and you could do that with ads so instead of running a big campaign you can run very targeted very standardized ugly ads to help you understand is this going to work so you you're going to have content that's pushing people people through the belief journey to here to having the one belief that this is what I need right the nons slimy most effective easy to teach method is show them evidence so you just find black swans I did 89 headlines so I wrote 89 headlines firstep I see a a visual metaphor I'm always wondering what are alternative similar visual metaphors that I could test something that simplifies because con these met for help people uh understand things really quickly this is my first podcast on the channel and I'm really happy to have someone incredible as my first guest Jean Michelle MO is a consultant a solo consultant helping SAS Founders to reach product Market fit faster I met Jean Michelle a while ago and the only thing I can tell you is that after a call with him after our first call my mind was completely blown away and I needed a few days to process what I've learned and so much so that in the next days I dig into all his content and I I watched all his videos check all his ads and I was just amazed by two things the first thing is the method he uses to help his clients which is very uh process sized and very methodical to test different message quickly uh find what works the second thing is that is not producing content or at least not the way we think of he it doesn't have a big YouTube channel it doesn't do podcast it doesn't write a newsletter no instead he focuses on advertising on creating the pieces of content that is going to push with ads to convert clients and that allows him to focus only on delivering result for his client I hope you will like this conversation as much as I did and I can tell you it is filled with gold nuggets if you are a SAS founder and you want to understand how you can use ads to grow your product or if you in the service industry and you want to understand how you can fill your pipeline consistently so enough talk I let you enjoy the show I am really excited to dig into your system your acquisition system because I have to say I've never seen anything like like it before and I might not have told you before but I quite du into it um with the Facebook ad library and I really try to understand your thought process what goes before what and all the other so before we dive into it uh can you tell us a little bit uh what you do um who you serve and how you do it sure yeah so I run rapid product growth and what we are is a partner for B2B SAS companies especially if you're around one or two million ARR and you're looking to double that's a a point where companies often you know they've already proven product Market fit but they need more systematic marketing to grow to the next level so I partner with CEOs and founders of those Siz companies and help them double I also do work with SAS Founders like earlier stage startups just because it's you know a special love of mind uh startups in general and so I provide Consulting like how do you get started how do you validate your Concepts basically how do you get your marketing working well I have to say that you positioning is Crystal Clear great it starts like you can say it in one in one shot it's a yeah it's it's a really good positioning and uh I think it's very hard to get there it's a lot of work just to get to the point that you can EXA yeah so that that already helps for the how do you acquire customers basically exactly you don't want it to be confusing for people like is this for me because no one's doing that thinking you've got to do that's a key marketing skill is you do the thinking for the people they can't yeah um yes yeah there is absolutely no doubt um and in your funel no doubt about assass Founders fer what do they want to achieve and the fact that you can do it for them so yeah now that we we know um so what should do for your Target customer tell us tell me yeah I will say tell me because tell us it's it's really well it feels like I'm podcast come on just a conversation let's let's chill out a little bit we want to know yeah we want to know no actually it's just me because I'm so curious so yeah tell me how do you acquire them glob your your customer yeah yes yeah I can tell you how I acquire my customer one little aside before we get into that is that um with business in general what's appropriate changes at each stage and I think this is why it's really confusing because we go and you can go and look what is what are huge companies doing or really successful people and you see what they're doing right now and usually that is 100% not what you should be doing you should be doing um in fact I think uh there's a there's a newsletter on this we should look up I forget who it is but you know be doing what they did when they started not what they're doing now yeah so it just depends on what you know stage you are and what's your cash flow and kind of risk profile um there's so many ways to solve this problem when I started my business I wanted not to grind I wanted to be really really maximize leverage uh and so that's why I went directly with you know paid advertisement and reverse organic because it's the most time efficient it's the most leveraged choice you can make uh the downside with Leverage is if you make a bad move your bad ideas are multiplied right so it costs you money um you leverage your bad ideas as well so that's why testing is so key uh but so how do I acquire my customers it's really simple I run a very simple ebook funnel so I'm offering uh you know a guide for solving a common problem that people have in SAS around user acquisition people sign up for the guide they give me also their phone number as well I call them and see if they want more help and that's more or less it it's very very very simple um and now that I'm at the stage that um this stage of the business I'm pivoting to another funnel so this funnel was great as like a getting started and now um now that I have you know I can have two three sales calls a day I would like to have them all be qualified and ready to to move forward um because uh my current the current final doesn't optimize for super qualified leads it's just optimizes for let's start the lead flow and um that kind of gets you gets the business going and then you can start um using the information that you learn to you know get more specific okay I think the key word that you use is reverse organ that is something I've never heard about although I know what you mean by that and I think this is the where I I would like us to go because that's that's what blew my mind maybe if you if you if you're okay with that I can try to describe what I've understood from your funel and then you you can iterate on so yeah basically you take the okay you serve s Founders and they want growth and you you know them so well that that you know every pain point that they have every frustration and and you know how hard is their life when they don't have the growth that they want and there you also know that they are um specific they are skeptical about marketing gurus and marketing tactics and and and you mapped out all of that to kind of create different um touch points to make them believe that should deliver result yes go through the to bring them through Journey so they go from I'm completely skeptical to I have seen enough of Johan Michelle so I know that he can help cool thing is that you also deliver result which is a very good thing if you want to to build a business right but the very hard part even if you can deliver result if you can't make people believe that you will give them the result then you you don't have a business but what you did is to create this kind of Journey for them in bit-sized small like two minute 10 minute videos pushed with paid ads on meta ads exactly yeah yes that's right that's right yeah I got it that's 100% right and to get and I help uh clients do this as well because basically everybody's skeptical about everything and I think the skepticism is going to increase you know we have we're living in the age of AI there's all these especially in SAS right there's no code tools how do you know that someone didn't just slap this thing together and it actually works and it's not going to ruin your business it's actually a big risk to try a new uh SAS and there's so many popping up you know it's easy to make a web page so I think um this issue of customers not believing you know affects my customers but I think it affects everybody right now more than ever before with I making it too easy to start stuff and not deliver um and I know this is also what people are skeptical in marketing you know everybody read Alex her Moi and decided to make a huge guarantee and that worked for a while until the market realized wow these kids don't know what they're doing so um so the way you do this it's really simple you take your you know you map out your ICP you map out your ideal customer and it's really critical that you look at their objections so if you already have sales calls or demos for your SAS business you map out every single objection and here's the key there's something better than handling objections is to find the belief that's underneath the objection and to completely remove the belief and so what I do is I map what's the sequence of beliefs that you would go through in order to come to the conclusion that Jean Michelle that rapid product growth is the key to unlock growth the next level growth in your business um and that it's the you know the most systematic the most lowrisk way to to do it uh that's the that's our positioning so how do you go from internet marketers are are terrible you know to you know this company is going to help me get to the next stage and so there's a sequence of beliefs just map out all of them and kind of rank them in order um uh you know maybe on the the far one side it's you know could you I don't need any help yeah could you could you give us like a two or three example of obvious beliefs to to make it obvious beliefs sure um so obvious beliefs that um obvious beliefs that let's just talk about SAS Founders because that's my one you know yeah so they a lot of them are thinking that SEO is the safest way to go that if you need to go and um get growth and you're not sure about cash flow um for ads you know people think ads are risky the unit economics might not work okay you should definitely do it SEO this is a common belief and so I don't want that is not a belief of my ideal customer that I should go with SEO I don't I don't do SEO I'm not a big fan um I mean it's great it's like planting trees you know definitely good idea to do it but it's very slow um so uh so what do I do to to counter this you know instead of trying to make it logical argument or do something very Flash I like to just show evidence to the contrary like a real life evidence and that's the easiest way to change the belief so just to show here's stories of Founders that failed with SEO here is you know actual factual data about you know it takes like 18 months to get an SEO program off the ground um yeah so I could show Studies by like you know even SEO people showing this I could show um data about current risks to SEO given that people are moving to like Reddit and chat GP to find their information um so I can just show that and make videos and content that are really easily digestible and what that does is that just moves someone down the belief ladder like oh SEO isn't the right way and maybe they have several other beliefs that are blocking them to get to the point of hey this is the way to go all right yeah totally makes sense and I guess that the more you do you do that you start with a few that you kind of guess or or know already if it's your chance and the more you you run this kind of acquisition system um the more you learn about your customer and you find new beliefs that you can add along the way always adding like a little piece to your puzzle and and gets better and better uh the more you do it exactly yeah it's it's a bit of a of a growth Loop you know once you the demos the sales calls the conversations that you're having you're learning about you know whatever was getting in the way of the person you last talked to there's your content calendar for the week you know make some belief shifting show them so instead of uh it's it's all about leverage everything I'm trying to do is maximum leverage so instead of trying to counter someone's objection or deal with one person's belief if somebody shows me evidence hey this is existing in the market I want to hit everyone you know how can I um maximize the effort to explain why this isn't so or show cont evidence right so Ju Just to to step back a little bit and to to organize you you never create content that you don't push with ads is that correct uh that is not correct just because I don't have enough cash to boost it everywhere So eventually I will okay eventually I will so I have you know my key platforms um where basically I have the best performance so at the scale that I'm at I I run this you know boosted kind of reverse organic play on those platforms everywhere else I just crossposted organic and it does some does some good you know so people find me on LinkedIn or or they find me on YouTube um uh but the only places where I boost post are YouTube and um meta all right the but they thing is it's fascinating because there are so many people me included in the hamster wheel hamster wheel of content creation and then and then there is something quite awful is that when when you create spend time creating content about something sometimes it feels like I've done it already so what's next what's the next idea yes you know and and then you have to come up with new things all the time and but in the end they are not optimized convert when your that's right is different it's like okay if if I have like five pieces of content that's all I'm allowed to do what they do should they be so so with these five pieces of content I can convert client at scale and maybe you are trial nrow but in the end you you push like five to 10 pieces of content and those are the only one you actually need but to get there yeah you have to do a lot of work to be courageous enough also to to start running ads on that and not seeing a result for a long time and I know that you told me a little bit about that already not exactly not exactly beginning yeah at the very beginning well I would say like you know um my business and and who I serve it's a slightly different idea but basically I I like to run a very simple growth Loop so you know in general I like to start with cold email is a great way because it's low low uh cost per user low cost per per call that's going to get you calls and demos that's going to get you revenue revenue is going to help you run paid ads paid ads gets you extremely efficient market data market data going back to the email and so it's and and the ads so it's it's a loop where it just it just starts to compound and compound and the question is like how do you start so um a great way to start is is you know how can we get quicker feedback that's the the problem you don't want to start a campaign and then you know let's see what happens that's the exact opposite of what I'm a a proponent of I want to get data tomorrow how I'm always asking this question how can we find out if this works sooner it's a great question and um I learned this you know running moonshot programs um you know you there might be some high-risk idea and somebody has a complex you know big thing and the question we're always asking is well can we figure out if this works tomorrow you know and usually in order to figure out if something works tomorrow you can't do it at the same scale you can't run a huge Department program in in a in a day so you have to find ways to get proxy data uh faster and you could do that with ads so instead of running a big campaign you can run very targeted very standardized ugly ads to help you understand is this going to work and those you can run very quick very cheap and just see ah look people want to click on these words it's a huge you know signal that okay that's the direction that the next step should go in okay so that's basically I know what you do so for me it's more clear but I I'm I'm doing maybe not doing the best job for my my my first leading conversation but we we'll get there let's break it down so yeah what you are saying is that if you start from the beginning and you want to acire a client for example as an independent as a consultant or even as a coach the easy way to start would be the for example for you call email can't do it as a coach obviously but as a consultant you can do call email that gives you the revenue so you can start generating ads the way we described before but there is something in between those is that once you start having revenue from your Coda campaign and you want to create your first campaign you also want to create the first campaign in the best way as possible and for that what you describe right now is that you are also using the same service as you provide for your your customers in the SAS Founders is the rapid testing method yeah and and then once once you have the data that tells you okay that's the message I need to push with my ads then you start scaling the budget and creating the content that fits to to what you found on the with this approach that correct 100% that's that's exactly it yeah so get yourself to a point where you have Revenue to invest in ads and then the next step isn't like launch a campaign the next step is extremely targeted tiny tests very cheap tests a large number of very cheap tests to isolate everything you've thought so far and I mean the another way to look at it is the Fidelity level of your feedback right so uh cheap ad tests are kind of like lowii you know you you get some data you're like wellow um maybe you have a 100 ideas usually if you have a 100 ideas but you'll have a bunch of 30% will not be good you'll get some mediocre ones a lot of mediocres and then you'll get three things that massively outperform the others and this gives you an indication people are very interested in those three concepts over all the other ways I could have described this these three get a market response but it's limited it's low five right you don't all you know is that got a click you didn't know did it get a purchase all these other steps um so you know every time you get data you kind of increase the Fidelity the risk the cost the um intensity of the experiment so start with something very low eventually you get to the point where okay we're going going to modify our demo script or we're going to modify the sales process um at this point and that's a bigger you know that's a bigger change to make um but so at each step you you're G to increase um the the test I don't know how to put it yeah yeah it's it's like uh you know little bets versus bigger bets once you get more data you can make a really big bet about something oh okay yeah that looking at my business I think I've had in the last year about sales calls um I have a very good idea now you know like it's I've also run all these tests and that helped me get the calls efficiently I have a very great I mean have a fantastic cost per call um so that those tests let me have the calls but right now where is you know where's my thinking coming from it's from real conversations with actual SAS CEOs that's you know much more valuable than you you kind of mix them together um but talking to people is is really the key to starting any business tot makes sense totally makes sense um would you mind um showing me the the inside um sure maybe what what would be cool is to look at the the testing method to start with at first uh I've seen on some of your content like the maybe you have a a prototype how you test an idea and then so that's the the very first step the rapid testing method and then after if we can have a look at the general structure campaign or different campaign how you structure your video to to create this customer Journey that we talked about that would be awesome absolutely and so I could think of two ways I could do this one is we could go look and and dive through specifics the other is I could pop open excal Draw and try to draw it which might be be easier to understand than like me clicking through that is manager that is totally my style okay let's go for an excal draw first and maybe we can later have a look or or not but excal dra would make things easier and maybe we should have started by that actually okay so let's see what am I trying to so you want you would like to know the whole system and I'm GNA try to do it like high level and then we'll go into one zoom in but you gota you just jump in with questions because um yeah okay otherwise 15 minute monologue here yeah but I'm I'm I'm okay with that but I won't P the questions okay so here we have okay where do we start because I could start from you have we start from no customers and we're we're growing from zero or are we starting from uh you have a business and now you want to level up where are we I think kind of uh I think should start from zero customers zero customers okay zero no no I mean is that you then you have call emails and that's not the topic of the this conversation we we really want to understand how how to tackle Facebook ads meta ads yeah okay as an independent for for service business service okay maybe we yeah maybe we can start with the the rapid testing method just to see approximately what what it does so that's the very beginning and then okay now that I understand my customer how do I proceed so like those two two major part would be awesome okay actually I have a flowchart for this mebe I should pull that open so um all right so first of all if you have no customers and you have no and you're like starting from zero then you need to contact everyone you've ever met in your whole life and and reach out to them and just do everything in your in your power to get a conversation going so the easiest way to do that that I've ever found is not to ask all your friends for for um for business because that feels weird uh can seem difficult so uh I would recommend you reach out for referrals say hey I'm starting this business big change in my life want to tell you about it is there anyone you know and then if they are a fit they'll tell you otherwise U maybe you'll find referral so that would be kind of step one like everyone you know if you've been alive for a while you probably know maybe a few thousand people um so you can you know reach out to every LinkedIn convers person everyone in your phone that's kind of the from absolute zero um bootstrapping and that should get you a customer which gives you a lot of of information because trying to help one person you'll have a much clearer point of view than um some kind of theoretical business idea so that would be step one and then once you've done that let's talk about how would you take everything you've learned from that one customer and and turn it into you know a customer acquisition system so the first step is you know just mapping out the the customer and the beliefs like we talked about so okay uh let's see can I highlight all over yes okay so the first thing is really getting in touch with who you're talking about and getting super specific um it's easy to start a business now and there are a thousand competitors and it's so much easier your marketing job becomes really easy when you focus on a single specific person one person so um hopefully you know a real individual that you could help that's like this it could be related to your first customer um and if you don't feel comfortable what you can do is pick something for today that's always a big problem people find is like well it's not you know I don't want exactly them I want them with more revenue or whatever um uh get out of here okay is this working kind of how do I make this beautiful okay so yeah so pick somebody for today then um the really key thing is to work on you know what are their pain points and how does that relate to your offer that's probably the most important thing about this is is knowing how the a specific person's actual pain has any connection to what you do that's like the most important thing if you were to do nothing else this is um the most important the next thing you want to know if you can that really gives you a massive leg up is not only to look at their functional jobs to be done but look at their emotional jobs to be done when you're trying to out compete other people empathy is is a secret uh tactic if you actually understand what somebody has to go through and you're able to show that it's way easier to pick you as a as a provider um I talk to people all the time like oh you know we're we're talking different Market agencies but we feel like you get us you know and that's because I actually do and um the way you want to you want to show that in your marketing so if you know the emotional jobs to be done like the the secret difficult things that you have to deal with that are an emotional part of your job um if you're able to show that in all your content or or or be sure that you know it this is a massive uh win in your marketing so for me for example it's different emotional jobs for say a SAS founder at two million versus a startup SAS founder like a startup SAS founder maybe they have to go all in they have to realize like yeah I can't do this just programming or they have to realize I can't be a product guy anymore somebody has to use the app to make money I have to actually run a company it's a different job than getting excited about a dream knowing how to build it for a technical founder right for a for somebody at two million it might be you know what I have to realize that just having my favorite um Business Development guide drum up new business isn't going to work like I can't find people and train them at the rate that I need to if I'm actually going to scale to five 10 million so there's different um emotional jobs if you're able to express that it's a huge uh huge leg up okay so these will be the key points and then like I said before this is that belief Journey so you're like okay they have maybe they have this belief one and we got to get to uh finally believing that this is the this is the best way to go forward that this product is the key to what I want so you you're going to have content that's pushing people through the belief journey to here to having the one belief that this is what I need right and like I said earlier the way the way you change these beliefs is you say okay they have you know false let's just call this false belief two I'm gonna replace this with you know to be ethical it has to be true you know what I mean you can't just scare people that won't work over time so it has to be a you know an actual true belief you know something that's true that we want them to believe instead and how do you get them to do that well the non-s slimy most effective easy to teach method is show them evidence so you just find black swans that's what I call them so black swans if you never believed that there was a Black Swan you went to Swan school you have a swan degree and you know there's only white swans I could argue with you or I could just show you one right so that's basically the ideas we just show them evidence and that's that's how you move people along this belief Journey so this is the beginning it's just m Ju Just for the the breaking beliefs um showing evidence is the only way or are you found that um you can also do that with a very well written all s message yeah it's just there's a million ways to get somebody to believe something um but what can I teach at scale to clients that I feel good about and this is this is it you know just showing evidence is very easy for to show another marketing team how to do this or have you know staff find specific evidence and and scale this system and it's very effective um there's lots of persuasion tactics but this avoids needing to learn persuasion it's just you know kind of simple that's that's true indeed because not everybody is a copywriter and I think it's also when we say it's showing evidence it's uh it's very closely related to testimonials um here someone I helped that was in this specific situation look now where I is um but it could also be different could also be like use cases that are not from you basically just this this is what happened I just show you the transformation to someone that tried something yeah exactly exactly yeah yeah and there's all different kinds of lenses that people respond to so you could tell a per you know a story of a person that had this situation you could show data uh you could show something that's kind of aspirational about you know where you want to get to there's all different kinds of like lenses on this but in the end it's the the thing that feeds it is evidence all right so this kind of provides the starting point for my methodology and I like to map out what do I know versus guesses and that really helps the testing so having you know I know things from ads testing I know things from conversations and other things I think I I think it's true and this was very true for me for example mapping out these false beliefs I learned that it helped me understand that actually I don't have you know One customer type I actually have maybe three and they have different beliefs it's not the same so trying to find evidence for your you know assumptions here helps you clarify the overall messaging all right so the first that's getting started yeah okay just getting started just getting started yeah and um let's see so I'll share the is that all right for you like I'm not asking you too much I have video no no let's do it I'm good um okay so that's that's there now the next thing and these these things here I like to do in a workshop I like to guide people through them because uh people try to they they they tend to avoid these tasks and they're the most powerful tasks and I think it's partially because it doesn't feel like anything's happening you know we're just sticky notes Workshop you know maybe we're just wasting our time same for competitive research a lot of people they're like let's get going with the ads or the email you know let's get these um clients coming in and here's the thing that is why competitive research is so valuable is your competitors have already spent maybe depending on what industry you're in tens of millions of dollars on bad ideas and they're no longer using them right if they're still in business so you could you know start over from zero and try to discover it all yourself or you could save a few tens of millions and just copy what um or be informed by what's working today and um it's it's a massive uh accelerator to just start from you know having a solid map of the world view of your customer right so what's all the products that's coming to them what's their world who are they watching on YouTube what are the top videos of the people they're watching like what's going on for them and um if you know that well so much easier to start um writing anything that makes that works uh for that um customer and I don't know why but a lot of people want to skip this and uh that's why I I do it with them just to make sure it gets done and uh kind of walk through it because it's uh makes everything else so much easier so that's what we would do next so we would look at like you know three or four direct competitors indirect competitors what's every single product what's every single offer what's every single claim and proof for that claim and really get systematic and make this grid of the competitive landscape for all these kind of components of marketing for the um competitors and so then once you have that once you know like your customer how it all maps together the beliefs and you know like their World Of Products that they experience then you're ready to start testing I had a client uh that wanted to skip this a little bit and uh and they uh um they went through uh and ran some ran a lot of tests and developed a really good ad and then they started looking at their competitors and they said oh my God they have the same same angle as me and I was thinking you know we could have just you could have looked that up they saved yourself um you know when I was a chemist we had this saying um uh what was it it oh yeah it's that you um a week in the lab will save you a day in the library and it's the same it's the same thing yeah I mean that's pretty much a lot of the lot related of what I talk about on my on my YouTube channel market research yes and how to find the right Insight um competitive research is is still market research it's a you you can look for what your potential customer is saying thinking um you can all there are so many uh data available for free on the internet if you know where to look at and you can save so much time and but it's just hard because it's hard to know where are they where do I start what do I do it's a that's why most of the people just uh skipped it yeah it's a little overwhelming and you don't know if you're just wasting your time and it's like well I could just start running ass yeah yeah absolutely so once you have this then you're ready to start message testing and basically we're trying to um I can even break it down finer than this but we're trying to isolate all the components of a message and so um high level you first start running an ad that just says hey do you have this paino that's it and you see do people click and if you're running a lot of different pain points to specific audiences you'll see that it's not always what you expected um and this helps you so you can just test the concept is this a paino but then you can also test how does this person describe the paino do they you know what's the language they use how do they frame it um from the outside uh you you might look in and think oh it's this but in their worldview they would say it differently they would describe it differently maybe they would blame a different Factor you know what I mean it would just be different so um that helps you that's the next step is just okay what is the number one pain what's the number one market pain that they're experiencing and this is where I would say a little bit of U there's some art to it because if you just here's one downside of just using the data if you just test pains you know what will always win given if you were to test all the Poss imagine you could test every pain Market what would always win is the most common pain right the most common most painful pain which usually doesn't relate to revenue because no no matter what business you have there's always earlier stage people there's more earlier stage people than later stage people there's no there's more businesses that barely Break Even than are generating you know 250k a year and there's more 250k a year than 10 million there's more 10 million than billion right so there's there's this always a this um distribution of problems and the most valuable problems the big problems they're worth a lot of money to solve fewer people have them so you have to keep this in mind when you're evaluating the data otherwise the data will always bias you towards serving really uh what's the right word clients with less money basically if we're if we're talking about starting a business right so if you were to just without thinking about you know what level is this pain and run this test and just run off the data you might go to down Market this is such a great Insight this is such such get yeah it's a very good one yeah because that that that is as a marketer and I honestly I mean I I would say that I was most of my marketing carer was in e-commerce and and so there is you don't have this um approach of okay I'm serving the same person but at different level you know you sell a product you set a product so you look at it at an equal level right but in B2B you obvious usly have like as you said like the the micras founder that is having program related to SAS and the the five milon year size fer that is having different programs but some are related and and and if you look at objective I I I'm just finishing and I want to know how all right so but I I would like to understand how do you look at it then because if you can't compare a on an equal level like okay this ad has a better click through rate than this one because maybe this is not the best the best one because there are more people thinking of this program you know it's it's just it's quite messy how do you figure it out and how does it work in e-commerce okay yeah I mean this is discernment you know um this is uh uh some skill but what the at the most basic level you would try to separate Problems by tear of business right so tears of client so you could in your mind or on paper or in Excel create some tiers five tiers and give yourself objective criteria like you know a business of this side if we're talking about serving businesses for example it could be a business with certain revenue and then you just have to ask yourself who who is the lowest who has this problem and you'll find that some problems are only they are not like high problems for um earlier stage businesses they're really big problems for later stage for example exiting founder-led growth is a very specific stage in your startup career you're like I I want out like I would like somebody else to do the sales this is a um it's a specific stage and that's a different stage than how do I stop managing the sales team versus how do I run an army of be of Business Development people it's those are different problems and so if you were testing them um you're going to get a um if you were to test these paines like how do I sell my product or my service that will always beat uh how do I hire my first business development person how do I exit sales how do I hire my first sales trainer um you you'll see that the the the the rates are different so you need to just sort of separate um and you can do that by categories and just say like um which of these is not shared in the vend diagram and pull it out and then evaluate them separately that that that is easier if you talk about problems that the the first years the beginners quote unquote don't have for example um how do I um create my first sales team then a beginner won't have it so obviously they are not included if you even if you don't call out any of the category you just talk about the paino you know that they are from the very beginning not included but some are common and that's where it's it gets a little bit harder yes that's true that's very true yeah okay and then for Ecom okay so people there are different um there are different I mean products hit different segments of the market you know right there's there's high-end High you know very luxury products and those can serve different pain points and you could imagine Within a brand there I mean usually Brands stick with one like segment but you could imagine there's the bigger solution um like even for I don't know a sports drink there's like how do I plan you know how do I do one thing versus how do I um go to the gym and plan my whole week you might have sell a whole like week kit and like a gym bag and like you solving a bigger problem that I just want one sports drink person does not have yeah but maybe it's it's it's more related to different kind of persona that's true that could Beed um yeah yeah it yeah they could have similar but you don't know which one has it but it's it's not as big as the the B2B Prospect chip though yes yeah sorry keep going through this long list yes yes please and if if you want to if you want to make it yeah maybe to go through the um high level H how do not high high level on the contrary I would like to you know when you say you create an ad yeah you want to see one what I what I try to do on the on the channel is to make things practical like you know that it's like okay how do I do it where is the what kind of AD so if we can kind of go on the Practical side that would be U very cool okay should I still finish this one yeah yeah okay I'll do it quick so so okay the next one I'll go into little detail on the next one the next one's headlines so after you do a Pain's headlines and basically you're testing every component of the of an ad and why is headlines green here it's just it's so it's such a versatile tool you could use headlines to test repositioning your product right so you guys I'm sure everybody knows about Loom the website the app Loom when they started they were a screen recorder and now they're the category leaders in you know we hate remote work or sorry we hate sorry we hate meetings and we love remote work and um you can test that kind of big swing in uh company and product positioning by just changing a headline so it's really valuable um and we do a lot of testing um of concepts with headlines this is a great way to inform say cold email or um email lists or ads so this is something come you come back to all the time and then when you have an ad you basically run it make sure it works um this is a a flowchart for earlier stage SAS uh folks so if your offer isn't proven we would just jump into chat as a way to have more conversations to get more data and Skip needing to build a page uh but if it is proven then you would work on optimizing your landing page and um optimizing the economics and the and the upsells which is a lot probably too much to go into but shall we go into how you would run one of these first tests like the pains test it it's tough really because I would like to go through each of them but I know that we we just completely exhausted master class I'll be like sweating yeah oh good go where where you want to go it's uh okay everything's cool let's um okay let's give an example I think the key thing though whatever you're doing even if you didn't have templates or you didn't use my exact method the key is to only ever change one variable if you only ever change one variable it becomes much easier to to make sense of the data so um that's that's really the core concept here is is is that and practically how you run these it's click testing so we're going to run traffic objective and we're not going to evaluate anything post click we're just going to see who clicked on what and if our ads are extremely standardized and we're only changing one variable then you can just think about that variable um so my exact template uh is not that important um okay maximum so we'll go into ads manager I'll just show you some examples I'm doing this all the time of course um are we an ads manager y okay so um let's see here's message testing um so you see I've got 83 adsets here of testing different messages and so this is me pre-work to build my my own second funnel uh for a different type of SAS client and so I've run a lot of headlines so here are you know a lot a lot of headlines that I I ran test for body okay so let's we can do this sure so what did I do I did 89 headlines so I wrote 89 headlines first step and um and then I ran them all as um traffic objective and the details don't really matter but I put in some rules to make sure that they stop after about four 500 clicks yeah there's more rules in there to save money but that's the clicks yeah Impressions sorry Impressions I'm into impression yeah yeah that would have been more expensive it doesn't correlate with the budget wow that's very per for me yeah yeah sorry no Impressions yeah so I spent what 250 Canadian dollars so I don't know what that is in real dollars um but it's less um okay and so how do you know how do we evaluate these I'll just give you an example and I I'll talk I'll come back to that um is this a highlevel problem or not so uh let's I'm just going to sort these by click through rate ideally I would do like unique outbound click through rate but whatever clicks rate Okay so we've got let's look at the top three we could also look at the worst ones and and you'll say oh these are worse and so these are headlines tests so what do we got here we have demo to close rate dropping at scale I believe this is what I'm actually running in an in a um in a funnel right now that I'm working on right now um so I have behind the scenes I have my targeting set settings and then I also have you know this in here to help further make people ignore it they're like I'm not be I'm B Toc or I'm not SAS or whatever um or I'm go high level and I'm confused um so and then this is just basically a giant headline there's nothing going on here except that and as long as I run other ads just like this I can compare the headline because that's the only changing variable that's the principle it's just we're doing a little bit of like a scientific test um there's a lot of confounding variables but we try to minimize those so let's look at some other results do you have the symptoms of poor pipeline conversion do you have you asked your doctor so um this one not quite as good um I can't say why okay so let's keep going uh yeah okay here's another one I think this is pretty good I might also run this one a single pipeline test that earned a two million uh AR SAS company fif demos um there I have those you know there are those and this is a good headline what I don't like about this headline is it's a bit curiosity driven it's not like it's lower intent you don't have to have a a business that's doing extremely well and want to scale in order to click on this it's like well I want to know that test I'm just start I'm thinking maybe I'll start a SAS business next year I got to know this in advance I could get those clicks as well and so this is how you could you could say uh and I didn't we didn't go over this but the intent level of this curiosity driven headline is lower so it makes a less efficient ad if if I were to guess let's do another one sales cycle length killing your growth rate close deals faster with 24 okay this one also did well I'm not going to use this one because I don't focus on sales cycle length I don't know why I wrote this I do do sales enablement sales cycle length is a little harder to fix and so I'm not going to I don't want people with this problem because it's not my exact specialty okay so let let look at some terrible ones is this making sense it does it does and it's really great to see it in action and I'm to be honest holding a lot of question not to have us for six hours in a row I would like to ask you about do you use broad targeting do what okay traffic where do you send them you know I I would like to to go so much deeper but we have can we can but like the core principle is just change one variable that's is if you're doing that you can start to you can there's you can do this um you can start to take whatever you're doing today and change one variable and see or isolate one variable like we're doing here um and start to make sense of it um and the key I mean there's lots of keys to save money but the number one is use click traffic to get this kind of data because that's cheaper that's like 90% of the technical part of it here's another one isn't this interesting double your demo pipeline in 90 days or we work for free isn't that interesting it's a killer sounds like Alex amazing guarantee yes amazing guarantee and here's what I believe I I think in my particular Market doesn't trust marketers we're talking about you know professionals they went to Harvard Mi they have um or you know they maybe they're in I've talked to a lot of Founders for some reason doing success SAS businesses they were in the military and that's where they learned leadership and then they see like kids in a white shirt being you know telling them I'm going to get you a thousand leads or I work for you know they see all these flashy commercials with you know what looks to them to be like children and they're like you know what is no you know they don't believe it at all and I think uh because of heroi uh influence this doesn't work anymore this kind of thing is a bad signal for my audience not everybody but for B2B SAS Founders you know making serious technology they don't they don't need that so it's interesting that this also does poorly um okay I don't know that's it there you go yeah that's that now that that's that's very interesting both the the Performing and the not performing so now if we if we take a do um if we zoom out that is the first step that you are doing right now because you are kind of creating a new funnel um modifying a little bit your offer to touch another type of clients at a higher level but this is the exact same step that someone would that would start in a service business but also with any size business basically size Service as well um so someone starting out that is the first step running ads with an offer isolating variables testing them one by one until we gather enough data that we know exactly what what what touches people what what works yes and then we can start thinking of okay now that I know that about my customer my potential future customers how do I create the reverse organic system pieces of Conta that is going to break their beliefs yeah okay yeah yeah I'll show you that for sure and I have to say um a lot of marketers do reverse organic and so I have a I have a A system that works at my scale I think I have like I don't know 15 videos I do know companies you know I know some of my friends that are spending you know few thousand a day in ads uh they have like a hundred videos and they are organized so that you can actually tell the platforms to show them in a certain order so after you've seen video one show them video two and they have like completely map this uh this uh belief sequence that we looked at earlier so that you are yeah they're really like try if you didn't like that one they're gonna get you the next one and and push you along and um but yeah I mean the key this all comes back to some things probably everybody knows that you need lots of touch points lots of hours to feel like working with somebody especially if you're a consultant or a coach um it's different than buying a pizza you know everyone knows what a pizza is you know it doesn't take a whole lot to convince you um whereas you know this is like who is this person can they really help me with a lot of skepticism that's and you can counter this again with these videos so here are some uh videos um yeah do you want to see how to do it or or or what are we go as long as you are um still good still okay then go for it if feel that we we can bring it we should bring that to an end it's it's totally fine it's been an hour already so it's totally fine but here we we get this great yeah I love it I mean this is here we get to the point that I'm really excited about you know it's like the meat like the how do you structure it so no I know the yeah the marketing message but I know the the frequency cap um method to to show them uh one by one or you can use video views and say okay only show to the ones that I've seen at a certain reach certain point by video then show them the the next one but I'm really curious to know how you do that how you create this series uh what are you optimizing for um yeah all that good stuff let's look it's so simple it's really simple um okay sure so first of all again I'm trying to get a lot of touch points and I'm trying to get some variety um in there so one I have kind of two systems going one is I frequently boost posts uh I just I'm trying to get more value content in front of people that's different so I have my system of belief stuff that's running all the time but then here and there if I write an email I'm like well then I'll put it then it's a LinkedIn post then it's a Facebook post and then it's Instagram re it's all gets distributed and I push it to the the feeds so we could see where does it say boosted boosted content so um okay so here's like a you know a video I did uh so it's just of con it's just a video on the theory of constraints because that works for my specific audience I don't know who's interested I I talked to I talked about the theory of constraint in one of my first videos actually yeah this is why this is why we this is really really really exactly yeah yeah okay then here's a you know a post that was um inspired by Grace lever's I actually met her copywriter later on so now I know uh who is writing for grace for these but Grace lever uh runs outsourced doers it's another marketing they they do like U they Place vas and it's another $10 million do um internet business but yeah so it's it's like it's a huge post right it's this huge long thing and um this is how I make I put that in people's feet and when you looked at it it does not look like an ad because it's not it doesn't have a a button there's no buy stuff I'm just trying to show up and have another touch point so this is not direct response marketing here I'm not trying to get a response although I can in aggregate look at all these costs bake them in and see if it's improved things so it is measurable but it's not easily directly measurable you know I can't say like did this Grace lever's post do anything because it didn't sell anything I didn't you know there's no CTA yeah it's it's it's kind of a bonus you know it has an impact for the people that see it and I guess that you are pushing that to the people that are already in your funnel if I would guess not to anyone yeah that's right yeah yeah so so so you know it hasn't like how how what's the the percentage of budget you dedicate on a here's how I do these it's uh what what do we got here Grace lever story post wow apparently I was really motivated on that one uh usually I do $10 over a few days for this one I did 30 bucks I don't know why I don't know why anymore and yeah it's uh you know I'm going towards people who engage with my videos who watched certain percentages of them and basically I'm trying to get people who watch like 50 seconds or more of my videos basically so I have these different percentages I always do standard video lengths so that kind of you know if watch 50 seconds that in Internet time it's kind of like dog time you know dog years it's a forever if you if you watched past the intro then you you are in my world why would you care about theory of constraints for 50 seconds on you know when you're scrolling you know you you're one of my people so this is how I find my my folks that um you know if it's really short it's long you know bigger percentage people went to my website uh people who booked your with me since September or if you are in my email list so these are all the you know if you're interacting with me at all have have some some content you you get all the contents yeah okay that that makes sense yeah so those are the kind of boosted things and then and then I also put videos out top of funnel so I'm running different uh videos that might be interesting to top of funnel people in fact am I running one right now um whoop okay time to change it busted you me but that's okay this one is done okay hold on let's turn this off while were you uh okay so I need another one there so um okay so yeah there's these different hopefully they're not so embarrassing as that or just that one okay um so yeah so I'm running different videos and uh yeah I've had a busy couple of weeks uh working on another FAL but normally I'm doing about a video a day and uh when it's time I put another one up here and I'm evaluating basically the cost to retarget them and because I'm doing the same video lengths um I I'm looking at the cost per 25% video view for me this is like the cost to retarget them with this content um so this is how I evaluate and I'm looking like okay what you know I got some good ones in here but it's hard to always perform at this level so you could see like man people really liked this one you know um but on average for me it costs about 25 cents you know somewhere under a dollar to uh retarget people and this is how I evaluate my Concepts I'm like oh you I'm trying to send super Niche content that's only interesting to my exact Avatar and then I'm asking how much does it cost to retarget the people that watch my videos as long as it's always Niche content this method will will help me make better videos I'm always looking at the angle and and comparing the costs that's really interesting so your top of funel is only always optimized for video views because you don't even need a conversion optimized campaign or something happening on your website because the simple fact that someone watch watches a part of your video qualifies them as a potential customer and when you say the cost for me to retarget them is like for example the the one that is selected right now you have like cost per 25% video views uh it's 51 cents it's the cost for you to bring someone in your ecosystem and then you push them everything you have in your middle of f yeah right that's it yes and that that's that's cool and but I guess there is a point where you also bring them out because otherwise you're because I think it is true you know that's I don't you know it's one year of data so if you didn't do anything else for a year you're out the platform saves data for a year yeah so I I have a year to convert you h yeah yeah this isn't my primary acquisition system it's just s of it's sort of like icing on the cake here um my primary is more expensive right it's just cold traffic to that top 3% of the market that's going to buy and this is helping bring in more and it's also helping fill the holes in the funnel and and helps with sales right if I'm sending these videos um then um it might bring in some people but it might also help convert somebody that was on the fence before our call that see some of my videos and and think oh maybe this guy knows what he's talking about so if if you sorry you want me to go yeah no no if you if you break down if you break down different blocks um the organization is like you have on one side the bonus no not let's go back you have on the very top only video views I have video views and conversion objective ah you still use that that where SP was yeah ah okay that's where all the money goes yeah this is plugging the holes yeah you want to look at that sure um yeah we can look at that so uh okay the value videos well finally if we're continuing the logic of video so I've got the top of funnel video um that we just saw so then I have middle of funnel right I also have middle of funnel videos that are pushing you to schedule a call this is pushing you don't look at my landing page please actually uh schedule a call and this is how I can put a value on this difficult non-direct response stuff because I can look at my cost per book call here where is it what am I on video Bo I can look at my cost per book call and it's $52 and you should know that this is very good 52 bucks um that's that's crazy yeah so that's this is why this is how I can put a value on that because I I take that number and then I just bake in the other hard to quantify stuffed and it makes the number a little bit more expensive and that's kind of how I look at it I'm like okay this plus the other fuzzy non-direct response if I bake it all in together what's my cost per call with that system really good okay keep going you know it's making sense yeah I mean yeah they like some campaign that are quite insane here yeah it's working so okay and then you want to look at um actual like where do I get the bulk of my leads I've actually scaled this down so this was doing you know a little bit higher was doing I think 250 a day which is not that honestly not that much um but uh I scaled it down because now I'm switching to another funnel and I need budget for testing and optimizing the funnel um but yeah so what is this at this is like scaled down to what 160 a day um this is where I'm doing and it's just different nice ads of mine that uh have performed well so I'm always testing ads individually again trying to isolate variables and then the ones that win I put them in this scaled campaign because they're already proven there's no um there's no question there and what are we doing here according to Facebook we're at $21 a lead for you know B2B SAS CEOs I think that's pretty good and um yeah do you want to see the ads you can you can go for it I was wondering so in this case it's a website lead conversion so you basically want someone to watch the video click go on your website download the resource that's the only conversion you you want you yeah you on the part of the people that you bring on conversations is not uh on this part of your your funel right well the funnel I sent them to a website and then they've put in their information and then the the SEC subsequent uh funnel page is would you like to book a call okay so yeah these also generates calls too so yeah so here's a an image that tested really well this is actually done by a pretty popular artist so I I'm licensing his art to to do this ad um and uh yeah yeah he's great uh he's got all kinds of cool uh and I just found that his art gets shared virally a ton a ton and so when scrolling you know uh strategic Doom scrolling on Facebook I discovered I'm like oh this is getting you know enormous shares um I reached out to the artist and said hey can I can I license this and mess with it and they said sure and so that's how I uh and then I had to still had to test it and it worked so um yeah so here is one ad um and we've got uh here's another thing I really like um so it's a you know how fast do you need SAS users and it's kind of see uh a visual metaphor I'm always wondering what are alternative similar visual metaphors that I could test you know if you see a great sketch or a great you know uh something that simplifies because con these metaphors help people uh understand things really quickly and if you want to see if you see something that's working you can ask yourself what's another similar you know a simile of that visual metaphor and you can come up with many things which may perform well so I tested you know actually yes yeah very good um yeah and then reals of course all right should have yeah yeah so there we go that's what's uh driving the majority of my leads well done okay that's a good one thank you for that um Michelle as I said several time I'm really holding myself to to not ask for the more NR but I think no one would be interested and and and at some point you would be probably bald but I'm already really happy on a personal point of view to have learned a lot in this conversation so it's a thank you thanks step it was a a pleasure thank you so much yeah can you share where where people can find you if you want to get a hold of me personally the best place is on Instagram so just jeam mellink so that's you can put it in the show notes but that's the best place to to find me I will on Instagram all right that's not it so if you are a s f and you want to to to unlock gross for your product then definitely reach out to Jean Michelle because he's one of the best marketer I know so far so don't hesitate thank you thank all right joh Michelle thanks again and uh see you later ciao
