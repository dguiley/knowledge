# Scaling Enterprise AI: Eli Lilly & Dario

In this episode, Diogo Rau from Eli Lilly and Dario Amodei from Anthropic discuss the transformative potential of AI in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in drug discovery and development.

## Core Thesis
AI technology's potential to revolutionize drug discovery is contingent upon trust in its accuracy and reliability. Enterprises must prepare for rapid advancements in AI models by integrating bespoke solutions and avoiding incremental adjustments to existing processes. By focusing on the future capabilities rather than current limitations, organizations can maximize AI's benefits for patient outcomes.

## Key Insights
- The advancement of AI technology holds the promise of transforming processes in drug discovery, necessitating a shift from incremental improvements to comprehensive solution deployment.
- A proactive approach in adapting AI models tailored to specific domains like biochemistry significantly enhances the potential benefits in enterprise applications.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Enterprises should integrate ambitious AI solutions rather than relying solely on improving current workflows.
2. Decision-makers must anticipate future AI advancements and plan their strategies accordingly, avoiding delays in deployment to benefit patients sooner.

## Notable Quotes
> "There will be another two-year delay and that's... two years during which all the work... to benefit patients is not happening."
> "If you do two-year-long projects, plan for where the AI is gonna... that sounds like an obvious thing to say, but I think it actually takes a lot of courage and foresight to do that."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
Focusing on the enhanced capabilities of AI models can inform the Wild Agency on how to better structure their technology deployments, ensuring readiness for upcoming advancements and avoiding elongated timelines that could delay benefits to stakeholders.
