I was diagnosed with REM sleep behavior disorder but the way that I found out I had it was I jumped through a second story window uh of a laint in in Walla Wala Washington which by the way I'm returning to in genu that's the most depressing part of that story that I'm going back yeah no that it's a [Music] l Mike where does this podcast find you in in my working it out podcast studio in Brooklyn New York where I live not nice so let's bust right into it your latest tour and is now a special on Netflix the old man in the pool which I I Mike I don't like culture but I went and saw your show and it was wonderful I I literally that that statement I laughed I cried it's actually true here I took my 16-year-old son we bonded over it he was really into it uh it's about getting older mortality and fatherhood can you walk us through kind of your cre a process how did this come together and manifest itself in a in a oneman show I started doing these solo shows that are like a hybrid of standup and theater the first one was in 2008 and it was called Sleepwalk with me and it came out of I you know I went to Georgetown and I studied dramatic writing and then I was doing standup at the same time in Washington DC when I was in college and at a certain point I thought well if I merge these two ideas I think that could make for something that's sort of interesting so I did this first show called Sleepwalk with Me in 2008 and I Did It Off Broadway in New York and Nathan Lane presented it and it was a big inflection point in my life and career and then I've ended up doing this is the fifth one now the old man in the pool and it was at Lincoln Center and it was the the way that I arrive typically at what the shows are about it it comes down to sort of what I'm obsessed with at that moment like I feel like with with any writing or art form or or comedy or art form is like I feel like it's like what are you obsessed with ultimately that's what your reader or listener will will be obsessed with also if if you're compelling enough and and the thing with me was mortality like I was in my 40s and I was like oh this is what I think about this a lot like an inordinate amount of time and uh and so I just started writing about it I was like well if I can make death funny then I think that that'll be ful to the audience possibly I think your your comedy is effective because you have it just this kind of nonchalant way of delivering it through storytelling can you can you how do you create the story is there an arc is there a process and how do you fit it into standup so yeah I definitely do and and it is a process I you know I work I started working with my director this guy named Seth barish who's a wonderful wonderful theater director an actor he was on the show billions um along with me but um but he and I talk through in the early forms like I usually I start with just jokes stories what am I thinking about what am I you know what are my experiences what's the funniest thing I can come up with at a certain point he and I will talk about like well what are the themes that are running through this and then we're sort of talking through like well what could be the what we call the Main Event of the of the show and um you know with the sleepwalking show with Sleepwalk with me it was like I jumped through a second story window sleepwalking and that one was sort of in a certain way obvious of like oh that's a really massive thing to happen in my life and uh and and in this one it's sort of a culmination of like realizing like oh I have you know type two diabetes and I failed the pulmonary test and I had bladder cancer when I was younger and and and and kind of all these things like 150 car pile up coming over me and and and thinking about that kind of in relation to my daughter and my wife and so that that's sort of that's usually the process so let's let's talk about that you were faced with a sense of mortality or the prospect of of you know you were very sick or potentially very sick at a very kind of an abnormally young age how did that change your approach to your relationship with your wife and your daughter and just your view of life in general I I think there's like two parts to that like I think that when I was younger like when I was 20 I had bladder cancer and I was very lucky they they got all of it and I didn't have chemo radiation so I was very lucky and I had when I was 25 I jumped through Second Story window sleepwalking so I had these two kind of near-death experiences young and that did this thing where it really sped up my ambition for doing all the things that I wanted to do in my life so uh it's funny I relate very much to in one of your books you talk about this idea of like in your 20s you recommend to your students that they just put their head down and just work work work work work because ultimately that kind of will pay dividends later and I think I had this thing where I thought well I don't know if there's going to be a later and so I'm just G to try to I'm just going to try to get this all done now and I think that as I've gotten older my daughter's eight years old and I think in the this phase of life it's much more focused on well how can I you know be a good father be a good husband and then connect with the people in the audience in a way that feels human you said something about the moment and I thought it's probably more indicative of just the life you lead as an as an artist and a comedian but I I saw you after the show I came back you were generous you hosted me and my son backstage and I said how are you doing and pretty much right away you said I'm lonely I been with my wife and my daughter for a long time I'm lonely it strikes me that comedy it must be very lonely that you're on the road a lot you can I mean I I've always admired what feels like a really supportive mutually supportive Community with comedians amongst each other but you're kind of in weird crowded or weird dark lit places where people may or may not be nice to you and the whole point of getting to the whole point of getting to good stuff is having a bunch of bad stuff and then going home and kind of like trying to ignore the bad stuff it feels it just feels very lonely to me can you can you speak to that I think it is lonely I think it's um it's funny like when I watch my my daughter and I started watching this summer this great documentary series on professional tennis called breakpoint on Netflix and I have to say like one of the things I love about it is you really get a sense of like you know these top 100 200 300 players in the world are not on Easy Street like it is hard it is hard to be one of these players and I do get the sense that it is lonely like I I when I watch it I think like oh yeah that's that's hard you're all over the world I mean ultimately like you you play your match and you you know you go back to your hotel and it's Pro it's just maybe just you or you and your partner whatever it is um I think I think standup is lonely I think it's fundamentally it's a solo sport you have to work out a lot in your mind you need to sort of essentially you need to outthink your audience and then make it seem like you're not outthinking your audience and then like you're saying you deliver it as though it's just this thing you just thought of and so that's sort of the magic trick of it but yeah London was really hard for me because I was away from Jenny and una for about four and a half weeks and it was it reached a point of being yeah it was hard I mean it was and I fortunately you know some of my comedian friends Jimmy Carr and Daniel kitson and some other folks over there reached out and were sweet about uh meeting up with me and stuff but it it it is very it is very hard so much about your show resonated with me and it was this one there was this one piece um and I don't want you to to bit but I'd like you to talk a little bit about it that even if you think of yourself as a loving person even if you're in the room with your family and you know you love them they know you love them you know they love you you know they know you know they love them and yet we just can't bring ourselves to tell each other that we love each other can you can you talk a little bit about this yeah it's funny like I in some ways I feel like it's uh it might be generational because like certainly like my wife and I say I love you to each other and to our daughter but yeah I think my dad my mom and dad's generation they didn't say I love love you you know I say in the show I they said take care which is which is not which is not the same um drive safely drive safely the one I heard in London was jolly good uh the uh just all these different things to avoid the emotional connection and um yeah I mean and that in some ways that's a lot of what the show is about is like all we have is this moment and and all we're promised is this moment right now and and it's like it just you know it seemed as though it's the thing that you you should do is Express if you feel love towards someone express it so we have a lot of young men that uh listen to the show I'd love to for you to just when we do something called office hours what advice would you have um to young men in their 20s who are dating and maybe not having as much success as they'd hoped I I mean I was there uh certainly um I have a joke in my new hour I'm the hour I'm touring right now is called please stop the ride and it's and I talk a lot about being single and how when you're single somehow it feels like you're kind of roaming the Earth just saying like does anyone want to be naked at the same time and then most people say no and then some yeah exactly and then some people say yes and uh and then you say no you know it's like and it's terrible and it's and I do think one of the things that's challenging is and falling is the timing of falling in love is like a lot of times you know you'll fall in love with someone and they're not at that moment in their life or to be in love or they don't fall in love with you or whatever and so I don't know what my advice would be other than uh I guess I would say open to communities to be open to like you know being outside versus inside I don't know like I like out yeah I mean I don't know what what's your best piece of advice for that uh first off get get build yourself up so you can endure rejection and then put yourself in a bunch of random environments with strangers and also don't be afraid to be I don't want to call it the aggressor but the initiator to go up to strangers and express interest um but yeah there's no nothing nothing easy what about advice uh to new fathers oh my God new father's advice would be do more than you think is the right amount of contrib bution in your in your house you know it's never enough and like whatever you can do to say to your partner let me go get us I'm gonna grab us Bagels I'm gonna go get this I'm gonna you know what I mean like I'm going to do the laundry I'm going to do you know like an infinite amount of things that could be helpful um I think we'll pay a lot of dividends later I think I I I think of all my regrets in my life it's like that I wasn't I wasn't helpful enough in the first year of my daughter's life and I was helpful but I I think in hindsight like no I wasn't helpful enough we'll be right back what would the next if in 10 years if you thought okay this is where I want to be in 10 years these are the this is the Box still left to check or that I want to check an indelible ink what does that look like for you in 10 years as a comedian it's two things you know I've directed two movies I directed Sleepwalk with Me which was an adaptation of the solo show I directed this movie called Don't Think Twice which is about a group of best friends in an improv group where uh played by Keegan Michael Key and Gillian Jacobs and a bunch of improvisers and Comedians and then one of them gets cast in like a Saturday Night Live type of show and then the rest of them don't it's about what happens in Friendship when people realize that not everybody gets the same thing and I think I would like to make more movies and I would like to make more specials I want I want to do those two things concurrently those are the things that bring me most joy and the things that make me feel uh most like I'm utilizing what I have to offer like I was watching I watched two documentaries recently one was on Nicholls and May and one was on Mike Nichols um and Mike nichols's career I find to be fast fting because he he started as uh this improviser in Chicago and he paired up with with Elaine may they had a hit Broadway show and then just interestingly instead of going the route of capitalizing on being a stage performer and becoming you know an actor a big on camera person he went the direction of like directing movies and becoming an oour and injecting dramatic stories uh with humor you know like if you look at the graduate for example it's like it's it's a movie where the dramatic Stakes are phenomenal and the story itself without humor is phenomenal and I think ultimately what makes a Transcendent is the moments of him in the pool underwater or him with the desk clerk at the hotel and I think that that's what I'm always trying to do with my shows and I'm trying to do with my movies is how can you take a dramatic story and then inject it with humor in a way that sort of you know uh it's it's the uh it's the sugar that makes the medicine go down yeah so Mike Nichols amongst other things he did The Graduate uh Working Girl the bird cage and I have some of a what of a connection a few months ago I got a call from his uh spouse obviously he's passed away but um Diane Sawyer who wanted to talk about doing a special on uh young men but yeah he definitely seems to have lived a pretty a pretty rich life so it sounds like you want to get behind the camera be more involved in writing producing directing would that be fair definitely I I think like you know I'm 45 now and I I feel like I yeah in the next in the next 10 years I'd like to get to a point where I'm consistently just writing and directing movies but like you know you've said this before on the podcast and on pivot it's like the the degree to which the industry is changing under our feet is so dramatic that the idea of movies it's like we we honestly I think we don't we don't know where that's even going yeah yeah talk about um you've been a contributor on uh public radio This American Life talk about and you were you were given the Kurt vaget award for humor talk about what the vision for that and um what you know how how you approach that and the impact it's had well I was really lucky so in 2008 I was um I told my sleepwalking story like if people don't know it it's just this very extreme story where I was diagnosed with REM sleep behavior disorder but the way that I found out I had it was I jumped through a second story window uh of a laint Inn in Walla Wala Washington which by the way I'm returning to in January that's the most depressing part of that story that I'm back yeah no that you're going that it's a linta yeah yeah you know it it would have been much more dramatic if it had been I don't know just like a Four Seasons or a club or something but a linta that's I don't know yeah you got you got got work better low it was a low point and uh so I told the sleepwalking story on um it was it was the moth storytelling series at the time now it's a radio show on public radio Etc it's a you know they have books it's a huge thing but at the time it was a storytelling Series in New York and they asked me to tell the sleepwalking story and I did 13 years ago I jumped in my sleep through a second story window of a laint in yeah when I say through I mean through the glass the glass was double pained I ended up with 33 stitches in my legs the glass was a centimeter from my Emeral artery had it struck there I could have just bled out on the front lawn and died I was diagnosed with a very rare thing it's called REM behavior disorder so when I go to bed at night I take medication and I sleep in a sleeping bag up to my neck and I wear mittens so I can't open the sleeping bag and then Ira Glass who's the host and producer of uh This American Life who's like a legend in storytelling and you know has you W pulitzers and peties and all kinds of things he really took to this story and he said he he wanted to put it on the show and he reached out and I said I don't know if I'm comfortable putting it on the radio because it's part of my show which I don't I don't want to give away the show because so much of Comedy is surprise and he called me and he goes he goes himself you know before that I was dealing with producers and assistants and other folks and he called me and he said uh he said you know I I really think you should put this on the show I don't think you realize the reach of our show like our show reaches like five million people like more people will call you about this than any anyone's ever called you for anything and then he and I like kind of struck up a friendship on the phone and we said you know let's get together in New York and we started talking about a bunch of different stories that could work on on This American Life and then we ended up developing maybe like five or 10 stories over the the course of a few years and so I was on the show a lot and he re and then he produced my two movies and he's really mentored me and taught me like an extraordinary amount about storytelling and you know a lot of the stuff it's you know it's like all wisdom all kind of you know gained wisdom is like it's you're just sharing what someone else shared to you and then and then they're sharing what someone shared with them and and and so yeah I feel so lucky to have crossed PA with IRA and I try to pass it on you know like I I'm a producer of Alex edelman's show which was on Broadway it was called just for us it's a it's a wild story it's about how he once was um he did a piece about being Jewish on BBC Radio and he had all these anti-semitic people following him and saying sort of hateful things on Twitter and so he started following them back and then one day uh they there was an invit open invitation for like uh kind of like a white nationalist kind of meeting in Queens and he thought what would it be like if I went if I just showed up at that and so he went and that's what the show is all about and so I I I helped him develop that and I produced it and um and a lot a lot of the things that I share with Alex are things that are just you know were taught to me by IRA and again we have a lot of young men or a lot of young people talk about the importance of being on time this is a bit that I did I did a bit on uh thank God for jokes about you know the thing that people that late people don't realize about us on time people is that we hate you and the reason why we hate you is it's so easy to be on time you just have to be early and early lasts for hours and on time lasts a second and then you're late and uh and I I just ramp on it I honestly like it's you want to talk about Tik Tok it's like I think it's a clip up on Tik Tok it's one of my my most popular clips and part of the reason is because people fight over it in the comments they're like I can't be on time because of this and because of this because of this and and uh and then other people go but you can be you just set aside more time I look I don't want to get into like the ideological side of being on time versus being early or late but I will say this when I was in college my my Prof professor John glavin who taught me writing I was late for a class once early in the semester and he just said um you should drop out of the class and I said no no I love the class and he goes well no you just don't you clearly don't want to be here and I said no I really do and he's basically if you're late for his class you don't get in to the class the door is closed and he doesn't want you there and again like it's something that it was a class that I loved it's my favorite class I've ever taken on screenwriting and and I value it so much and it was one of those like I don't know it was like a pivotal moment where I was like oh yeah like if you want if you really want to be somewhere be early you just can't go wrong with that if you really want to be go early yeah you you you did I I mean this sincerely I've I've struggled with being on time one CU I think I'm selfish and I I think being late a lot is is it's just selfish you valuing your own time over other people's and you just summed it up so perfectly you basically said and of course you did this as they did the late Theater seating to mock people but that you've you've got forever to be on time or early yeah I mean you've got I've got an appointment you know to for lunch this Friday with someone I have between now and then to be early that's right and it just struck me like what on Earth am I ever doing being on time much less late I've got forever to be early and it's just such a easy thing um to just show a a you know a small smidgen of of respect but I'm I'm I want to U just just real uh briefly say that I found you I sought you out and as someone who's trying to be a good dad trying to be a good husband trying to be a good citizen everything you said really resonated with me and I have found people quite frankly comedians that make me laugh harder you make me think more you really do and you and you make me feel more you touch on very intense topics sort of fearlessly you know there's been comedians that talk about social issues fearlessly that are profane fearlessly but you talk about you know very deep meaningful issues Life Death love being a good dad fearlessly anyways Mike I hope that you continue to be Fearless Mike bigley is a comedian Storyteller director and actor in addition to
