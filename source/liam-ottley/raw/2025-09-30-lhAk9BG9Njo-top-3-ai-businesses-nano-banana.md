# Top 3 AI Businesses Nano Banana

Published: 2025-09-30

It has now been a month since Google dropped their incredible nano banana image generation model and since then people have really started to explore how to use this to build businesses and make money. Each time we see a step change in the technology we get what I call a fertile plane for new businesses to pop up on and for people who are quick to be able to make money off of it. So, I wanted to bring on my guy Jason Stacks, who's been deep in the AI, image, and video generation space for the past 2 years and built an entire software and platform around it to reveal the top three AI business models that people are using to take advantage of this AI image gold rush. Jason, mate, great to see you. I'm excited to get into this. I think, uh, image generation is one of the biggest opportunities for people to build businesses in AI. Um, particularly, uh, this new Nanabana model, which has been been incredible, and we're going to be diving into how people are making money with this, what business models are are on the horizon. Um, and I'm I think you're the best person to bring on to to talk about this. >> Cool. Thanks for having me. Uh, so my name is Jason Stax. Um, why you should listen to me. I'm a former musically creator and I dropped out of college in late 2023 to pursue AI miss generation full-time. Uh, I've generated over six figures for brands and creators with the strategies I'm about to outline right now and our clients have done over 4 billion views online. >> Just for a bit of context, Jason, I've known him for a while. um going way back to sort of the early days of the AI automation agency space and I remember way back you were doing uh you had a AI image generation for brands where you'd be able to customize like memes and stuff for their uh for their particular brand or insert their it's probably a lot of the stuff that we're going to talk a bit about later but inserting their Could you give us a little bit of a context on that so people know kind of where you where you cut your teeth in this industry? >> Yeah. Yeah. So we'll we'll definitely jump into that. That's that's kind of the the bigger you know hund00 million plus opportunity that we're seeing with AI right now. Um, and I know you and I were talking before we started filming about, you know, where is content creation going. Um, and there's there's a really interesting trend that we're seeing. So, definitely definitely stick around for that. >> Okay, we jump into it. >> All right, we're going to be breaking down the top three ways to make money with this new Nano Banana model. It's only been out for a couple weeks now, and we're finally seeing, you know, these these business models emerge. Um, so this is going to be all the way down from most beginner level at 1K to 5K per month. Easy opportunity that literally anybody with a uh couple fingers and a brain can do. Um, and then we're going to get up to our 5K to 10K per month opportunity and then the $100 million plus opportunity. Um, so starting off super simple design freelance. This is the most obvious use case that we're seeing with AI image and nanobage made it 100 times easier. Um, which kind of pains me as a former designer to say, but it's it's true. Um, so here's a couple case studies. Um, a couple client payments I've gotten to do these these projects. These were all AI generated. Um so first things first if uh you don't have you know any any industries that you're already active in uh we want to find an underserved niche right so any type of niche that is u in need of design services but may not have that technical expertise to to know where where these AI tools are. Um so here's a little prompt that you guys can use in traction to help find some of these these ideas. Uh so you know we want things that have high ROI for businesses uh and are super specific and super niche. it's going to make it a whole lot easier to to compete as a as a brand new guy. So, yeah, here's here's a couple really good examples. You know, pet groomers and walkers, um Etsy sellers, um you know, they may not have that that technical skill set, um but they are are very creative. >> And so, a lot of these obviously going to have like text in them, right? So, how have you found um the the effic like how good is it at getting that text in there as you need like in a in a marketing sense of making it the composition be correct, making sure that everything's legible? These things are pretty like pretty bloody good at this stuff right now. >> Yes. So, this is the first model that we're seeing text actually being coherent. So, you know, big blocks of text up to, you know, two sentences at a time is is able to be very very coherent. It might take like two tries, but it's the it's the strongest model we've seen. Um, so I actually show you guys the niche that we're going to go into is one that I've done. It's it's super super super niche, but it's houses for or it's sign designs for beach houses. Um, so people who, you know, sell sell rentals for their properties, uh, they need, you know, a nice a nice sign that kind of sticks out from the rest. Um, so this is, you know, design is changing and it's less about the technical skill set. It's more about taste, right? Anyone can do this, but the difference between you and the other guy is having the taste as to this looks like a good design, right? So, what you're going to want to do is find example images for your um, nano banana. So, we'll go through here. I really like this one I think is super clean. So, you would want to download that. Um, then just keep scrolling till you find, you know, three to four images that you like. Head on over to Nano Banana and then literally all you have to say is based on these references, generate a sign design for a beach house called um, Under the Sea. Um, you know, you just say something random. What we're really doing here is coming up with a portfolio and a case study that you can go and take to other brands saying, "Hey, I made one of these before." Um, so like use pinks and greens. I think those will look cool. And we'll just go ahead and uh shoot that off. >> And it's super fast, too. It takes about 10 seconds, which is, you know, incredible for compared to tragic. Chad takes two minutes to >> Yeah. I mean, that's always been one of the worst things about using the >> Yeah. >> the consumerf facing versions is it's just so painfully slow and I've always wanted to get Oh, crap. >> Yeah. So, it look it looks pretty solid, you know. Um, inspired by references, you know, you can kind of see the little elements it took from each one. >> Yeah. >> U, and then you you can literally just download that and what you're going to want to do now is you can actually mock it up on an actual house. So, >> it'll make your portfolio portfolio look even uh even more professional. So, >> what's the play here? Is that so you can h this is your like portfol you kind of told me what it is. It's a portfolio. So when you're pitching to do the AI image generation services as a freelancer, you're using these as your Okay. >> Exactly. Exactly. Um because you you don't have a any clients yet, right? So this is how you get your very first client doing this business model. Um so once you have >> you're basically saying like, "Hey, I've I've made this the sign. I came up with the sign and here's what it looks like um in in in the real world supposedly or or a mockup of what it looks like." >> Exactly. Yep. Um and now the next step is we got to find a client, right? We got to find somebody who's going to pay us to go and make another one of these. Um, so what I like to do is go ahead and Google and find um Facebook groups where people are asking for this exact design, right? So we'll go fa Facebook um need help with beach house sign design and just see what you can find. Yep, here we go. Um, this one's a little bit older. Um, here's four months ago. That's not too bad. personalized beach house sign for Outerm Bank's location. Boom. Someone's looking for someone to make an outdoor sign for the beach house. Um, so you know, super simple. Now I can just go in here and say, "Hey, I make these and attach my images." Think you only do one image. Um, I make these professionally. PM me if you're interested. Boom. And maybe someone will uh will stumble across that comment. Um, but yeah, it's super super super simple. I've actually gotten clients doing that exact method. So, you don't you don't have to overthink it at all. Cool. So, post those in organic channels and I'd recommend signing your clients on onetime payments, you know, between$100 and and $500. >> And the nice thing about Nano Banana is you can keep you can keep revising it until they're happy and it's really not a ton of extra workload on on your end. So, >> this is obviously one of them doing like designs for the sign as an example, right? Uh there's there's a lot of different directions you can take the the specialization of your skills as a as an AI designer, right? So you can do sort of the the mockups of websites. I think I've talked about that before in the channel that there's a lot of value in these models and being able to like give them a lot of variety in terms of say me wanting to re redesign my personal personal brand website. The value of AI designer to me is I could pay 500 bucks and they can come up with I can say here's generally what I'm I'm into my elements my personal brand. Can you give me like 20 different versions? It doesn't have to be crazy advanced, but at least just explore where this can go. And I think that's one of the major advantages of the this kind of technology. And for people who are coming in who maybe don't have the the last mile, like they they can get it 90% of the way there. They can give you an idea of what it looks like, but that last 10% is probably a professional designer um who would be able to take that into a final design. But there's so much value at least from from my from my end if it's like just the sheer volume of of ideas that you can get out of image generation say on logo design or on web design or just like the brand pallet and things like this. So u what's your what's your take on that and how you can maybe look at some other high value services within this kind of freelancing pocket? >> Yeah, I 100% agree. I think leaning into that scale is is super a super huge lever you can you can use is like what is a service I can provide somebody that requires you know 100 images 200 images right maybe it's a a a uh you know designs for a wedding venue and you have to have all these different elements that need to be cohesive and you can have you know all these images pumped out super super fast I think that's definitely a a really smart thing to do >> yeah that's when you can connect it with basic AI automation skills you can go on to n or make and you can set up loops where can take in via a form. You fill out some information like what is what design like tell me about your personal brand or or your website design. Fill it out and then it's going to generate tons and tons and tons of different options and they can you can show that to the client. Say here's 50 different versions. Let me know which ones you like best or or you can even do that filtering process beforehand and give them the 10 best ones. >> Any other questions on the design for their side or should we hop into the the next opportunity? >> No, I think that's pretty straightforward. I mean there's other ways that they can they can run run leads for that. They could maybe go on to Upwork and start to put a bit of a profile there. Um, but yeah, the the social media side of things is is definitely a good place to do it. You can go to school communities and just find people looking for design help. >> Yep, for sure. That's that's a good point. Um, cool. So, next is going to be the $5,000 to $10,000 per month uh opportunity. So, I'm sure you guys have heard of faceless content. It became a trend a couple years ago when AI first, you know, entered the scene. And the people who have been able to do this well are making5 to $10,000 per month consistently. Um, so here's one of our creators. which is my client, AI Fusion. Uh we're going to be hopping into uh his his uh his pipeline here in a second, but in a single month, he did just under 11K in in revenue. So, super impressive. First step is you're going to need to find a niche uh to kind of like put your own spin on, right? So, it's like what niche are you going to consistently make content in? It can literally be anything. You know, I always suggest people do something you're interested in because you're not going to get bored of of making that content every single day, right? So, if you like soccer, go make AI soccer videos. you know, a really great place to uh find find some of those those niches is Flickup. So, this is actually my my software, and we have a community of creators who all put models up on here. And what you can do is scroll through and find one that you want to put your own spin on. So, I'll actually pull up AI Fusion Masters uh profile since we'll be we'll be talking about him. So, he does these kind of like AI president type videos and is is super super successful at that. So, what I can do is be like, okay, he has this model of of buff giants, right? maybe I want to take this and put a spin on it where we're putting these buff giants in designer clothing, right? And that's a really interesting niche to to to start in because now you can start having clothing brands sponsor you down the line. Um kind of >> so these guys it's not like they've trained their own model. They've just got reference images and your software is allowing you to sort of prompt on top of those reference images and and get things out of it. or is there actually like an underlying prompt that has been used for each of these images and then you're just sort of putting the the user prompt on top of that? >> Yeah, so these guys already have the reference images and the prompts that they're using on Nano Banana. They're already in this model, right? So, let's go ahead and test one out because what we're going to need to do if we're going to do that niche, we need to make some content, right? So, we'll say buffed uh Obama wearing designer clothing on a runway. uh shoot that off. And you can also upload reference images here. Uh so if you you know had specific people that might not be as well known or uh you know using your your friends and that kind of thing, you can get super creative with that. Cool. So now that you've created your content and you have it ready to go, you need to be posting this every single day. So what I recommend is trying to post daily, but I still advise for quality over quantity all day, especially when it comes to AI because you're competing with all this AI slop. Quantity is not a flex. Um, so your main priority is going to be making, you know, high quality content that you're actually proud to post. Um, so we'll actually take a look at AI Fusion Master here. >> Yeah. And I'm interested what the the business model here is because I see a lot of it like this guy here is is like you use you're using AI generated content to like teach them how to do AI generated content. It's pretty smart smart way of doing it. But I guess the the bigger opportunity would be the like actual creating an AI influencer. So, in terms of the business model here, WA, they're getting some crazy views on that stuff. >> Yeah. Yeah. Wild views. This is actually lower than I think he does on Tik Tok. Um, but yeah. Holy crap. >> 1.7 mil. Uh, 17 mil. Yeah. Like I said, the creators on our network have done over four billion views with this. >> Is that Epstein? >> Bro, u, but yeah, great question about the business model. So once you've built the audience, it's time to monetize, right? And uh you know what a lot of people do is is they teach you how to make this exact same content because what does everybody want in 2025? They want views. They want to go viral and they don't care how they do it. Um, so, >> uh, this guy has a $67 viral AI prompt bundle and it works really well because once you pay that one time, then you're also in a school community and you can access all of his other resources um, >> uh, ongoing. So, >> I've seen a lot of guys a lot of guys doing this. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's huge. Um, and so I recommend that over uh, charging a subscription fee. So, >> uh, for your school community, because once they know how to do the content, you don't want them to churn, uh, and and go go look somewhere else. We want them to be sticky inside of that community. >> I know you you you had a lot of success having a free school community as well. So, sell that for $25 to $100 one time. >> And then what you can do is actually use Flickup like we were just talking about uh, with those AI models and you can now start productizing your content. These users inside your school community, right? What's the next thing they need to pay for? they need to go pay for the tools, right? So, why don't you own that tool yourself? And so, that's exactly what AI Fusion has done. He's taught his community how to use his tool. Um, so he kind of gets to double dip a little bit in in that that revenue. >> So, and what so there's a there's a affiliate program like referral that he's be able to give to the people in the community and then they sign up and then he gets cut of that. >> Exactly. So, we actually currently don't take any cut of revenue from these creators. Uh, we're just focused on on growing this platform. Uh so any anything beyond the API costs uh these these creators get to take home. >> Okay. So just like really drilling into what the what the opportunity here is. It's it's the the creativity around coming up with interesting characters or formats I suppose is the is the thing you're trying to come up with like the buff the buff presidents or something or um certain people as like a a drink brand or something you know like taking a format that you can repeat over and over and over. I hear you've got a you got a bunch of them here. Um But finding one of those that's unique and then pushing that out on social media, getting views with it, and then using that traffic to uh teach people how to do that also and then monetizing it through reusing your proven formats as well. What's to stop people just going stealing everyone else's format, though, cuz you could kind of just be doing that right now, right? >> Yeah, definitely. And I mean, like you said, it's it's about finding that repeatable format that you own, right? You you need to find something that's a little bit different. Here's another one of our creators, Junk Box. They have crazy crazy >> friends characters as kids. >> Yeah. >> Like just on a people in >> show business. >> The AI baby trend. We saw it go crazy but they were in it earlier than the rest of the world on it. And so they've coined the AI baby thing as like their thing. Um so yeah, I think that's that's the wedge here. >> Yeah. And then what do you think that the the like real moat here would be taking? I suppose you can't take their likeness and make a whole like you couldn't take baby Gordon Ramsay and make a whole brand around it, right? Because that's it's probably some sort of legality issues with legality there. But it would be like I've seen the one that I keep seeing on my feed. I think probably because I follow it now is the jar monkey of like the the Rust Rustarian monkey like running around. Um I just keep getting hit with his reels. you can see down the line how they would very easily be able to just off the sheer amount of views there start to sell sponsorships and stuff off the back of it. So, do you think there's more opportunity in just playing it like this and finding a format and sort of rinsing it like this or the sort of defensibility would be to shift into your own character? They've got a video going out on this um I think probably not long after this one goes out where I break down a bunch of different AI side hustles that people are are talking about online and this this was one of them, the AI influencer trend. And I think it's it's a little bit difficult because you have to be kind of creative and funny. Like if it's based on being funny and and content that's sort of shocking and interesting. Uh some people just don't necessarily have a knack for that. But if you do, it's a really really good way and there's so much leverage in it when you be able to create these crazy clips in literally a few minutes of prompting and you can set up automations to do it. So what do you think the the real opportunity is here for people? >> Yeah, for sure. So definitely not setting up automations to create the content. You know, you definitely have to, like you said, have that knack for creativity. And I would also urge you, don't build a brand off of, you know, Gordon Ramsay himself, right? You want to build a brand off of that style, which these guys have done really well with the baby style. And now they actually partner with with celebrity likenesses to do collab posts. So, they've had official deals where Mark Cuban has paid the money to make a video. Uh, Snoop Dogg has paid the money to make a video. Jack has paid the money to make a video. >> That's crazy. >> So, so that that that's really where you want to where you want to be at with this stuff. You could say like turning characters into like turning famous people into dogs or like animals of some sort. Um >> that's a good one. Yeah. >> It's like turning them into like their spirit animal version or something would be uh would be one as well. >> Yeah, definitely. And and it doesn't even have to be a uh you know a celebrity, right? It can it can be there's these AI ASMR trends that are going crazy right now. You know, it's like what would an ocean full of you know, slime look like? Those types of things. >> Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Like I mentioned, you can turn these into models. I'll I'll hop in here so you can see a little bit. Um, you can upload reference images in there and then upload your prompts right inside of of >> Okay, so that's at the top there. If you go if you go go back into that again. So you've got the What does this start? What does this start with? Right. So if you want to create one of those, you need to generate your own image through just like [ __ ] around with the image generator. >> And then you can pull that into your own style >> and it's got the reference image. It's got a teaser video of it and then people can just go in there and prompt on top of it. >> Yep. Exactly. Yep. >> Cool. Okay. I got it. >> Cool. Um and then like I mentioned, yep, you link that in your your school community for longer term revenue. Cool. Now, we are going to jump into um I think the biggest opportunity when it comes to AI and this stuff gets me super pumped up. This is where I think content is going. any of you people who are afraid of AI slop taking over your life. Um I hope I can change your mind because I think this stuff is pretty cool. Um, so, uh, here are a couple really awesome examples of ways people have used AI to create entire viral trends, right? So, um, Hines Ketchup did a really awesome one, right? Where, as you can see, these are all like, you know, AI generated Hines Ketchup images. Um, and these were actually suggestions from from users. So, uh, it was it was users saying like, oh, I think we should do ketchup that looks like this, you know, and it created a ton of buzz. The campaign reached over 1.15 billion people. Um, and I was worth 25 times the money that they spent on the ads. Um, >> here's another example. Back to the future the musical. This is what you were mentioning uh earlier that you remembered. This was our very first client. Uh, we built a AI time machine where you can upload a photo and then time travel as one of the characters from the show. And uh, uh, during this time they they grossed over close to $90 million in in revenue for their their production. So that was a super super successful campaign. >> Uh, and then Wicked also used this strategy. um the the Wicked movie, you could generate your own student IDs. So, it was really like pulling you into that universe of Wicked and obviously they crushed with a $750 million worldwide box office. So, if you want to do this yourself, you don't necessarily have to, you know, have have one of these these giant names. Um you can do this for any brand that has any kind of viral appeal, right? So, um, this this offer works really well if you already have, you know, established marketing clients or maybe you have someone in your personal network that has has a brand that could use, you know, that viral marketing boost. Um, and in this case, uh, for this example, we're going to be using better vision. So, this is the reason I chose this. This is in my personal network. A buddy of mine owns this app where you can view your fantasy, all your fantasy apps in one place. So, it kind of has that natural virality in the sense that, you know, there's a ton of people who cares about those fantasy teams. >> Yeah, there's lots of different, I guess, exposure across many different types of fantasy leagues, right? That uh that all can all can be put under that same kind of content. >> You've got different angles to angles to make videos on. >> For the business model side, I would suggest pitching $1 to $5,000 per month on a contract basis with growth incentives, right? Because if this thing goes goes crazy viral, you as the marketer, you want to get get compensated for that. >> Yeah. Cool. So, next thing we're going to do is we're going to come with an idea for a viral AI generator tied to this fantasy sports app. Um, so the question we want to ask is one, is it brand relevant? Is this something that has some sort of ties to this this product that I'm trying to sell? Um, number two, is it 100% personalized? Is this something that everybody walks away with a piece of content, an image that is personal to them? So, think about, you know, like Spotify wrapped, right? That's the most personal thing that people go and share around Spotify. Um, is it sharable? again ties into personalized that doesn't make people talk. Um you know if you can spark debate across people that's that's that's a really great angle. Um so in this case the idea we're going to run with is an AI that rates your fantasy football team. And step four we want to play around with Nano Banana and and see if it can accomplish that. Um so I just did a couple quick tests. I I dropped in a screenshot of my uh fantasy team. I'm pretty proud of my my team there. Uh, and then I basically just told it, you know, the cool thing about Nano Banana, and this is, you know, really key key point here, is it can do analysis before it actually generates the image. And so this is a huge huge break breakthrough. So what I was able to do here is after a bunch of testing, um, you know, give it specific instructions like find the name players, find their colors, find their numbers, then come up with a realistic team rating of of what what we would uh consider the entire team. Um, so it does the whole text generation where it breaks it down and then it generates a super super high quality image of of that team up. >> That's sick. >> Yeah, it's freaking nuts. And like you mentioned like text text is is fantastic on this model. >> So what's like the actual the integration of this into the into the company's marketing and like with the distribution of it. So what do they put out like social media posts? Hey, check the link in our bio for our generator and tag us in it for something or or what's the actual roll out of something like this. >> Um, once you kind of have that prompt and you kind of have the the thing that you want people to be generating, um, you can throw that into Flickup using the exact same method that I just showed you with with those other Flickup models. Um, and then the best way to launch these is through organic channels, right? You don't want this to feel forced like the brand is forcing people to make this this content. Um, so we found works really well is is just launching them on Reddit. So, this was one of our our projects um where you could upload a photo and see if a hundred of that photo would be a gorilla. Um that's [ __ ] genius, bro. Well, so you can put any you could put anyone in the WWE up against uh an animal or something or be like >> Yeah, you could put anyone in the world. Um, it's so what what we did is now I go to the r/WWE and I throw one picture of of John Cena in there. Um, and it sparks this debate across across people. Um, so then they go and find the the generator and make their own with all these other >> That's cool. >> Um, so yeah, >> interesting. If it's quite controversial and creates debate, that's uh that's like extra verality, right? >> No, 100%. Yeah. 100%. Um, and you got people kind of like being like little detectives and investigators of like, oh, where'd you make this? You know, so that that behavior works really, really well. >> So, in terms of the the offer for this, are you you're saying is this like a discrete project where they're going to sort of pay you for for the buildout initially in the setup or like you had before, it's like a retainer might be 1 to 5k per month. Um, does this do you need to keep refreshing this and coming up with a new one every quarter for them? Uh, how would you keep this going and prevent them from churning? Are there other parts of uh like helping them out with any kind of marketing material? Is it I know you see like these these restaurants I think I've seen them on on Instagram where they have like find like one really viral format for their restaurant. Um and it sort of they blow up and they never have to worry about money ever again and they just booked out the booked out the door. Um, but are there also a service that you can build off the back of this which is trying to generate those kind of real real based content that would be posted on their Instagram that is kind of similar to what we talked about in the in the previous business model but bringing that into this but for but for brands. >> 100%. Yeah. No, I think uh you know the biggest uh the biggest value that you can provide as the marketer here is that entire campaign, right? All those campaign assets, all that strategy around how are we going to get people start sharing this? what communities do we post these in? That is where your value comes in and the creativity of, you know, just the the campaign itself, right? Um, and I think that's that's what's super exciting about this is like if you're creative enough, you're going to win. And so it's similar to like hiring an organic marketing agency, like you said, you know, they might not produce anything for three months, but on month four, you know, they have some crazy format that just works and it it keeps working. Um, and so it's a matter of being able to iterate until until something takes off. >> Interesting. Yeah, I think this is a this is a massive bot for people. If you can get the right business to sort of test this on and cut your teeth and and find something that works, um, then one case study is all you need to walk into any business and offer the same thing, right? If you could go to anyone and say, "Hey, I'll make you go viral with that with AI with with like AI content that's really taken over right now within like 3 months. It's going to take us a lot of testing, but we will find something that that works for you." And this is the offer. I think there's a lot of money to be made there. >> And we actually collect emails as well. Um, so you can upload those emails into your any email email software and actually retarget them in different ways. So that's >> again where where your value. >> Yeah. If you put like a welcome series off the back of that and just like nurture them, nurture them, nurture them, then put them into a like give them a decent offer, >> that would that would murder. >> Yep. For sure. Um, and then the final step is just analyzing those results and and giving your clients, you know, things to be be excited about. >> So that's all trackable through Flickup. >> Yeah. Yeah, as you can see how many people used it and engaged with it. Um it is a little bit harder to track, you know, the actual view counts once it leaves Flickup. Um we we found an average of a 100red views uh per generation that happens on Flickup, right? So if if you get 10,000 generations, you can confidently say um that you've generated a million views in in >> Okay, mate. That's freaking awesome. Thank you. Thanks for coming on and sharing that. Um I'm so glad you came on cuz uh I know you've been doing some really cool stuff in the space for a while. It's such an exciting space, man. Like I think that's the the main the main point. If I was starting from zero again and I like didn't know I see there's like voice agents a massive opportunity that are are really going to change the world and and how how everything kind of functions around us, how we contact businesses, how chatbt contacts businesses for us. Um voice agents massive opportunity there. I think uh just general AI workflow automations things like that. Um there's the the vibe coding and building software with AI. And I think this image and video generation and the creative side is another massive pocket that if you're just a young person or even an old person looking to find a find an entry point into AI, I really urge you to have a play around in all those different categories I just talked about and find something that actually excites you and interests you. If what Jason just broken down there is really lighten lighten things up for you inside and you're like, "Fuck, I I could really get into that." I think this compared to other kinds of AI automation entry points and niches for people is relatively easier on the technical side. Like these models are doing 95% of the heavy lifting for you. There are different sort of softwares you could build around some of the workflows you create, but that's that doesn't necessarily need to be done immediately, right? So, uh, thanks for coming on, man. I think this is a is a really really good place for you to be looking into right now. Um, and yeah, what's what's your thoughts on this sort of long term? you made a great point where, you know, a lot of these AI businesses is like looking for the unsexy automation, the unsexy problem that you can solve. I feel like this is a space that's so brand new. Um, and you know, it it's it's pretty fun, you know, and you can you can take take your interest just like the creator economy created this entire new uh you know, way to make money just by being creative. I think this is doing that, you know, once again. >> Sweet Jason, I really appreciate it, mate. Good to good to catch up.
