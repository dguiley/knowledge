# The People Problem

> AI and business solutions fail not because of technology but because of people.

## The Reality

| What People Think | What's Actually True |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| AI tech is the hard part | People adoption is the hard part |
| Better AI = better results | Culture alignment = better results |
| Build it, they'll use it | Champion it, they might adopt it |

## The Research

- MIT: 95% failure rate for custom AI projects
- Wharton: 75% positive ROI from general AI tools
- Difference: implementation complexity and people resistance

> "AI wasn't the problem; companies were. People inside the companies were."

## Why People Block Adoption

1. **Fear of change** - Unfamiliar = threatening
2. **Status protection** - AI threatens expertise identity
3. **Skill gaps** - Don't know how to use it
4. **Culture mismatch** - Organization doesn't reward AI use

## The Solution Framework

### Education Before Implementation
> "Offer training as an entry service to build client relationships and pave the way for more comprehensive AI solutions."

### Internal Champions
Foster "AI champions" inside organizations who:
- Advocate for adoption
- Train colleagues
- Demonstrate wins

### Organizational Restructuring
> "AI won't destroy your company, but your org chart will if you don't do this."

Traditional hierarchies actively prevent AI leverage. Restructuring is non-negotiable.
