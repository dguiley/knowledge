the interpretations of a person's anger are impacted by their race and their gender and so some people have more of a license to be angry outwardly and publicly typically white men who can be angry in that way and when they are it was historically they were perceived as competent and motivated and in all sorts of good things when women or when uh non-whites or other marginalized groups Express their anger outwardly they to have um uh their their qualifications minimized so they're they're thought of as too emotional too sensitive unprofessional and so [Music] on Professor Martin where does this podcast find you uh I am in Green Bay Wisconsin at uh in my office let's bust right into it in your book why we get mad how to use your anger for positive change you broke down all things anger including how to both cope with and use anger to your advantage so let's start there what is anger and how does it affect us and the people around us yeah so anger is an emotion uh it's everything from the mild frustration we feel uh when we can't find our car keys in the morning to the intense rage we might feel uh when we are treated just truly truly terribly or poorly and uh as an emotion though it of course affects our Behavior it encourages us to do um you know sometimes positive things but also sometimes negative things so the way it affects the people around us is it you know we can end up hurting people when we're angry we can end up uh criticizing people when we're angry we can end up engaging in dangerous behaviors that that either may accidentally harm us or someone else or um just are unhealthy right so people use uh you know Alcohol and Other Drugs when they're angry and so on so it affects people in all those ways so I often say that I'm I struggle with anger and depression and I'm curious well I'll describe how I register anger maybe I'm mislabeling it but something triggers me um something dumb sometimes it's something on social media or I don't know something upsets me and I get so pissed off and often times I'd say most of the time it's myself and then it's like my blood turns to acid and I know this burning sensation and then it stops and I'm exhausted and then I go into this depression like like acid has run through my veins tired me out and now I'm just down it goes from it goes from anger to depression you know I I think that what you're describing is a relatively common phenomenon that um you know our emotions don't happen in a vacuum we have a tendency to talk about them individually and I think because that's the simplest way to think about them but the truth is that we are angry at the same time we're sad or depressed or scared or guilty or a host of other things and so what ends up happening is moments like what you're describing we come across something uh we don't like it either because we find it to be unfair or we find it to be you know poor treatment or because it gets in the way of our goals and being able to achieve those goals and uh so we we react negatively to that now of course if you just take one of those types of provocations I just meant you know not being able to achieve our goals or having our goals blocked of course that's going to lead to feelings other than just anger right and it makes sense that another emotion that can stem from that is sadness or depression or fear or some other feeling and what was interesting that he said there too is that and I don't know if this is what you meant so if you meant something different definitely correct me but you know this this this idea of acid running through your veins for me and for a lot of people when they're angry it becomes this lens that they're looking at the world through right and so all of a sudden a lot of other stuff that happens in their life uh is interpreted in a very negative way right it's that sort of phenomenon I've had a bad morning and because I've had a bad morning uh all of these little other things that are happening are sort of filtered through that experience and this sort of negativity beg gets more negativity and more negativity and it just kind of keeps going that way and so yeah it makes sense that there's this sadness or depression that follows my father used to say that anger is fine as long as it's planned and it reminds me of that photo of kushev at the UN banging his shoe on the table and the the photo is the aperture on it or the perspective is brought enough that you see he's still wearing two shoes so we brought a shoe with a plan to bang it on the table what are your thoughts and it leads to in your in your book you discussed the concept of good and bad anger say more yeah I mean anger can absolutely be used for good I mean ultimately if we think about emotions from an evolutionary perspective which is how I tend to think about them then they exist in us because they solved some sort of adaptive problem and the same way sadness alerts us to loss and fear alerts us to Danger anger alerts us to Injustice and it provides us energy that we can use to confront that Injustice and uh I think the the question of whether or not your anger is good or is bad in in some ways has to do with the consequences of how you use it and so if if I get angry over let's say politics and I because that anger dri drives me to you know drink or be depressed or do a host of negative things uh things that are bad for me well then that those consequen that anger isn't healthy in my life if that anger drives me to work towards particular you know social change Works towards particular positive outcomes then um you know that anger we can think of that as as being healthy in my life you recently wrote a huff post piece where you discussed how the state of politics evokes feelings of anger especially in men um can you break down uh what you meant by that yeah so um and I should uh actually credit you with this um in some ways that ultimately I uh maybe the day after the election or two days after the election I was scrolling through Tik Tok and I saw uh a post from you where you were talking really about how this election might have been influenced by male anger more than I guess I was expecting it to be and it it really gave me pause it it it helped me realize some things that I hadn't necessarily been thinking about and then coupled with that I was I was at a basketball game my son's basketball game in a relatively small town in uh Eastern Wisconsin and a stranger came up to me said they' seen me on theon's podcast um and he wanted to talk to me about his anger and you know this was a a person who I suspect is very different for me politically if I'm just guessing based on demographics and the two of us had a really thoughtful conversation it got me thinking about all of the ways in which um I need to be talking to and uh engaging with young men in particular who might be really angry about the State of Affairs to help them work through that anger in a in a healthy way I dug a little deeper into the research after that and what I what I saw is that okay men are are reporting getting angry almost twice as much as women in their day-to-day lives they're experiencing more negative consequences as a result of that anger and when you look at why they're getting angry um it's a it's a host of reasons but one of the big eases is feeling like they uh didn't get what they wanted right that they're not getting something that they are are Desiring they're having their goals blocked in a significant way if you've decided you have too much anger in your life and like I really go down a rabbit hole I role playay in my mind confrontations with people or topics and un that's unfair to them I imagine them you know I imagine myself in an argument with somebody and that's unfair to them it's like when you're I don't know if you've ever W up woken up and your partner is angry at you because of the way you behaved in their dream it's just not it's just not cool right it's not fair to them so say you decide for whatever reason whether it's your own mental health or the way you treat other people or it's it's reducing your productivity that you want to reduce the amount of anger in your life across all of the different practices in behavioral therapy what do you find are the two or three most effective ways to to try and address your anger other than Pharmaceuticals I start with a real big picture look at this and you know understanding okay so why am I getting angry what are the patterns here that we're seeing and you can anytime you feel something you kind of map it out I I sometimes diagram this the way might diagram a sentence or something that it it includes really three things there's some sort of provocation there's some sort of thing that happened unfair treat uh uh you know Injustice or goal blocking then there's my mood at the time of that provocation you know was I stressed was I whatever uh and then there is uh my interpretation of that provocation like how I what I thought it meant what I decided it meant in my life did I did I think I could cope with it and and so on once you figure that out and you can see those patterns then there's actually sort of infinite ways you can intervene we can be more aware of what provocations we're inviting into our life we can manage our stress make sure we're staying hydrated we can uh exercise do a host of things there we can think about how we're interpreting those things and focus on the appraisal and then ultimately we can try and deal with the emotion itself when we experience it and so through deep breathing through um medit ation those things like that to try and bring it down as far as what do I think are the best things um I do think that focusing specifically on that appraisal element I think we we what people need is to figure out how to have a realistic understanding of the consequences of a particular situation and you know we find all the time I mean we use driving as an example um you know you get cut off you you get angry and uh you know your interpretation of that is sort of a he shouldn't have done that or they shouldn't have done that that was unsafe that was dangerous um and all of that may be true but then the next question is okay so what were the consequences the consequences are that this person cut me off now what do I do next and so often people switch into like sort of vigilante mode and it's like well I need to get revenge in some way but we know that that doesn't actually really help or solve the problem um often times it makes it worse and so I think thinking through okay how bad was this can I cope with it what do I do next is a is a good sort of problem focused why have dealing with it so I'll just PR forward a thesis and you tell me and I think you'll agree with it but I find that I'm much less prone to anger the more social I am what do I mean by that when I'm around co-workers or in the office and i' say oh this was a shitty job they or people around them have a chance to go well it was shitty because we didn't get get this edit done in time because the power went out or I get angry at my partner and they will remind me well actually no this was your responsibility or the more I'm around people I hang out with the Republicans and instead of getting angry about well how could you elect this guy I sort of get some context for why they think the people I'm supporting make no sense either I it just helps me to be in the company or the presence of other people and to have those guard rails it's almost like a solvent for my anger because I it helps me have different perspectives and realize a lot of times my anger is more about my gut or that I didn't have lunch or some weird chemical running through my brain than anything I should actually or that justifies my anger that for me the key is human contact that is my Neosporin for anger yeah I think that's fascinating and it's really part of what I was trying to communicate in that huff post piece too is this idea that interacting with other people who see the world differently from us can help provide different ways of interpreting those provocations and so if I'm only looking at the World Through My Lens and I'm not listening to other people to try and understand uh you know that that broader context yeah I'm I'm likely to get angry because uh I'm I'm doing probably a lot of mind reading uh about I mean it goes back to what you said before about you know you sort of roleplay those interactions with people if you could actually have those interactions with someone you would they would probably surprise you as far as how they they react to things or maybe they would surprise you about how they react to things so that those conversations that we have that human contact it really does shift two things one it shifts that what we call the the preanger state right your mood at the time of the anger of the provocation it also shifts your interpretation it gives you a new way of thinking uh about whatever this provocation is and helps you see things a little bit differently in a way that might lead to less anger we'll be right back you had said in a conversation with theovon that the golden rule of emotion and parenting is kids tend to express emotions the way their caregivers did um so how do you and to me a basic parenting our basic truism is your kids will model your behavior right so what advice do you have for parents in terms of raising resilient kids that know how to leverage good anger and discern between good anger and bad anger first of all I I do think you have to decide how you want your kids to emote and then you have to live that and so if that means you want them to uh handle their anger in a cool calm matter well then you have to live that right so yelling at your kids for being angry isn't going to get you where you want to go you're just modeling that behavior and you're probably scar you really scaring them in the process um I used to think about this when I was when when my kids were young I never wanted to them to see me scared of anything that I didn't want them to be scared of right so like because that's how you that's how you teach them so I'm not a great flyer um I haven't been and so what it what it you know I find myself anxious when I fly a lot and so one of the things that meant is that when I get on of C with them I can either let them see me scared um or I can just fake it and even if I'm scared I'm just going to have to sort of hold that in now that my kids are older they're 13 and 14 I can kind of communicate hey I I'm not a great flyer I don't necessarily love this it's totally safe but I find myself a little anxious about it you know we can do the same thing with anger there are times when we're really angry where we just need to sort of fake that and I mean we can still communicate that you're angry but find ways to um to sort of channel that into healthy Behavior so they see and understand things understand kind of healthy ways of of co-being and communicating the other thing and you use a really important word in that question which was resilience so how do we teach our kids to be resilient I think one of the things we have to do is um help encourage our kids to engage and actually step into some emotional discomfort so one of the things I heard you say an theovon is that you won't let your kids back in the house unless they talk to someone right when there are something along those lines and uh and I think that's you know in some ways that's about um encouraging them to step into some emotional discomfort like hey you got to do a a difficult thing here um you got to communicate with someone that you might be a little shy around um I do something similar with my kids we're at a we at a basketball game over the weekend and my my son there's another boy about his age there um he was a little uncomfortable interacting with this kid and so I tried to give him some some Clues like hey this these are things you have in common let's practice how you can talk to him about those things how you can communicate with those things stepping into some of that discomfort so that they learn that the emotion itself probably isn't going to harm them and they learn to do those kind of emotionally difficult things where is the decision point of framework for communicating anger versus occasionally just not communicating anger I find a lot of times that I need to take a deep breath and not communicate my anger recognizing that it's more about what's going on with me than necessarily what that person has done do you have any sort of rules of when to express anger and when to kind of keep it to yourself yeah I I do and I I think sort of my internal algorithm there is to think about what the what my goal is what is what is the outcome I'm looking for and if uh if my outcome is or the outcome I'm looking for is I need this person to maybe do things differently um or I want this person to do things differently well then I think about okay so what's the best way to do that and that might be for me to communicate to them that I'm feeling frustrated um and that I'm angry with them and that I want to you know work through that there are times though where I think you know what this person isn't going to change that's not going to get me the goal I want um and so maybe it's better for me to just kind of hold this in find another way to channel it find another way to deal with it and and uh and move forward and so I tend to to focus a little bit on those outcomes um and think about okay so I want X what's the fastest way to get there I'm really fascinated you've done a great job of sort of branding yourself I I think uh Professor Angela Duckworth is the grit Professor you're sort of the anger Professor I love the way you've branded yourself can you give us a little bit of background on how you got to where where you are and when you decided to sort of focus on anger and you know where other than teaching is it books is it also speaking just describe the business of Ryan Martin yeah so I started studying anger officially in uh 1999 when I went to graduate school at the University of Southern Mississippi um I'm originally from Minnesota um I was but I was you know unofficially studying anger way before that so I was raised in what we I think I'm always a little anxious about giving people this this version of it because I think it sounds worse than it was but I was I was raised in a relatively angry household now it was a loving household like we all get along but but we referred to this thing called The Martin temper um and in particular the the men in my family so I have two brothers and a sister and then my dad had uh was a relatively angry Guy and um the interesting thing is very rarely was that anger taken out on each other I mean it was usually you know my dad I can count on you know just one hand how often he was angry with me more often than not he was angry at co-workers he was angry at service providers and so on and so I became really intrigued by this emotion at an at an early age in college I worked with uh at risk kids quote unquote at a shelter uh in St Paul and I noticed that you know difficulty controlling anger was a pretty Salient common problem for those kids now these were kids who had a lot to be angry about the world had not treated them fairly at all but consistently those challenges were there so I went to graduate school with the goal of studying this and was was researching that at a certain point realized I was less interested in clinical work than I was teaching so decided to be a a uh Professor um and came to W Green Bay um where I taught courses on Psychopathology and emotion and so on and I think during that time I became really aware of the fact that I thought the world had a didn't necessarily understand anger the way it did uh other negative emotions or perceived negative emotions like fear and sadness to just look at the research there's tons of research on depression tons of research on anxiety disorders um tons of research on aggression and violence which you know I've already sort of highlighted is a little bit different but not much on anger and so I really decided to go down that rabbit hole to study why people get angry and started writing books and doing talks on it any thoughts on what role if any anger played in the election I think it played a a considerable role and so um you know I've heard you talk about this a little bit I mean I think that in it informed people's votes I think it encouraged a lot of people to I mean I think it plays a role in every election um but I think it informed a lot of people's votes um we also have evidence that um I mean we have evidence for instance that making uh people angry is a good way to spread your message virally on the internet that you're more likely to click on political ads if they make you angry we also know that angry people are more likely to believe conspiracy theories um anger is the most viral emotion online that people are much more likely to share things that make them angry than they are to share things that make them happy especially if they don't know the the person who shared it so if I'm scrolling through Facebook and I see something that makes me happy I might share that but only if I know the person you know I'm be like oh this this person's got good news here let me share it if I see something that makes me angry I'm much more likely to share that thing even if I don't know the person who who shared it and so all of these things that we're seeing um are are really D driven and motivated by people's rage yeah it feels as if it's sort of it's been incredibly weaponized by technology that from kind of the end of World War II to the introduction of Google we thought that the ultimate branding strategy was sex cells you know show hot people playing volleyball and if you drink this beer you'll be hot too and then we figured out that actually we found something better than sex and that is Rage and that we have these algorithms that find incendiary content elevated it algorithmically and we're all sort of in a state of like near rage all the time you know I think I would add to that too that the part when when we go back to why we get mad and we talk about um you know those provocations and we talk about our mood at the time and our interpretations the part we haven't really focused on yet is the role that misinformation plays in all that and that uh misinformation both informs the lens through which we see those provocations um but it also informs our our interpretation or our appraisal of those things when they happen and so um when we have leaders who are perfectly willing to lie to us to make us angry and then continue repeating that lie over and over and over again to motivate people to the polls to motivate people to share that misinformation online um I mean there is a very very very clear incentive for our leaders and not just our leaders but others uh who are who are marketing to us to make us angry and it's hard to combat that it's hard to to fight back at that are people who have a greater tendency to be angry generally professionally speaking more or less successful hey great question and you know this is one of those cases where it depends a little bit on uh on some other factors so one of the things we know is very clearly tied to both success and anger is you know the the type A personality right people who are competitive people who are uh driven motivated focused they tend to be aggressive and they tend to be angry and so from that perspective yes like we we see that we also see that that I mean ultimately when you're that go driv driven one of the consequences of being that goal driven is that it's easy to have your goals blocked and when you have your goals blocked you you get angry um so we'll definitely see that some of the confounds here is that we tend to see uh anger uh the interpretations of a person's anger um are impacted by their race and their gender and so some people have more of a license to be angry outwardly and publicly typically white men who can be angry in that way and when they are they're um it was historically um they were perceived as competent and motivated and in all sorts of good things when women or when uh non-whites or other marginalized groups Express their anger outwardly they tend to have um uh their their uh qualifications minimized so they're they're thought of as too emotional too sensitive unprofessional and so on because I've read that more actually young women are triggered um by today's politics but you're saying that it's actually men who are more easily triggered I see it as white dudes are basically feel more entitled and have less less downside and it sounds to me like you're saying the incentive system is to just let your anger flow and I find I mean I I'll use an example I'm not proud of this up until maybe 10 years ago found it was really important for me to express my displeasure with service employees if I didn't get upgraded at the Delta counter or I didn't like my room at a hotel and then I realized okay that's not effective and I'm channeling my R anger to the wrong people I'm being heavy-handed with the wrong people but I definitely think it came from a sense of entitlement and I don't know if it was about gender or race but in the US I think there's a a we're so consumer or customer obsessed that we' sort of given license anyone who's paying someone else for something the right to be angry at them should there be any misstep or the service isn't right there or your Wing Stop doesn't get there in the 20 minutes it was promised or the the matri or the waiter doesn't show you the respect you think you're entitled to because you're now royalty as you are a customer so to speak is are service mentality leading to people's entitlement around being angry yeah so so one of the one question I recently asked participants in a study was uh you know which of these things is going to make you the most angry How likely are you to get angry over these things and in the options were experiencing or witnessing an injustice witnessing or experiencing poor treatment um or three was having your goals blocked and what we saw is that men were more likely to be triggered by the uh unfair treatment or having their goals blocked what they said was like not getting what they wanted basically women were more like to be triggered by Injustice and um now the biggest Gap though and this is goes to your point about entitlement the biggest Gap there was not getting what I want men said that you know that there was that was sort of the biggest difference between men and women was that when men don't get what they want they were much more likely to get angry now now the big question what's missing from that data and is is it something that people actually deserve or is it just something they want and I think that's that there's an interpretation there is this a thing that I deserve because I paid all of this money for it or is it just a thing I really want and I think what we're seeing and anecdotally I can tell you one of the things we're seeing my experience has been that there are a lot of men who interpret something they want as something they deserve Dr Ryan Martin known as the anger professor as a psychology professor and the dean of the College of Arts Humanities and social sciences at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay talk about to get angry a faculty of leadership role oh my God that would drive me badshit crazy he's an expert on anger and the author of how to deal with angry people and why we get mad how to use your anger for positive change he joins us from Green Bay Wisconsin where is A6 de Professor really enjoyed this conversation thanks for your good work yeah thank you so much for having me e
