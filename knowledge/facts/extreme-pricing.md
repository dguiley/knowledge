# Extreme Pricing Principle

> Price at the extremes: extremely expensive for a few, or extremely cheap for everyone. The middle is where businesses die.

## The Principle

| Strategy | Target | Requirements | Example |
|----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| **High-end** | Select few who can easily afford | Human-intensive, service-based | $100K consulting |
| **Low-end** | Everyone | True scalability, near-zero marginal cost | Amazon |
| **Middle** | Death zone | N/A | Most struggling businesses |

## Why Middle Kills

- Customers are needy (price is significant % of their income)
- Margins are compressed
- You work as hard as high-end for less money
- Can't afford to acquire customers aggressively

## High-End Logic

For service businesses requiring humans:
- Same work, 10x the pay
- Customer neediness inversely correlates with price
- When fee is 1% of client's income, they don't care
- When fee is 50% of savings, they're ultra-demanding

## Low-End Requirements

True low-end only works if:
- Near-zero incremental cost per customer
- Massive scale possible
- Usually requires significant capital (Amazon raised $680B)
- Most undercapitalized entrepreneurs can't execute

> "If somebody's paying $100,000 and they're making $10 million a year, it's 1% of their annual income. They really don't care that much. Low-paying customers are ultra needy because it's a huge percentage of their income."

### B. Application

- If you have a service business: raise prices, serve fewer clients
- If you can truly scale: go low, but have the capital
- If you're in the middle: pick a direction and commit
