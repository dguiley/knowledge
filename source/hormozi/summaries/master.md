## Core Wisdom (Cross-Episode Synthesis)

### Volume Doctrine
- Unreasonable volume separates winners from losers
- Most people quit at month 3 of content
- Door-to-door still works: 1 sale per 12 doors

### Focus Doctrine
- One avatar, one channel, one product to $1M
- Don't diversify until single thing is working
- CAC + COGS < first payment or die

### Time Doctrine
- Content = 60-month minimum commitment
- Longest time horizon always wins
- Build skills before building businesses

### Discipline Doctrine
- Real discipline = doing what you hate, when you hate doing it
- Motivation is unreliable; systems are reliable
- Persistence through dark periods is the filter
