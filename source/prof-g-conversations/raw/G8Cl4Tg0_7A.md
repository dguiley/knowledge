you reached out to me and said is there any way I could talk you into doing a small cameo in the White Lotus and my first response was well how much would that cost me we were casting a part for a lawyer I was in kosami you sent me the first your first recordings I listened to it I almost [ __ ] my pants cuz I was like I don't know this sucks this sucks I don't know if it's going to fly and I think I had then I heard you mention it on on I think on pivot and so I was extra nervous that I was going to somehow disappoint you and I did not want to disappoint [Music] you David where does this podcast find you Los Angeles after two weeks on the road in Asia and DC so I've lost my voice but happy to be home so this show if if I was a and there's a reason why I'm not an executive of HBO but if I was pitched on the show I'm not sure would have seen it it being that sing has sort of become a little bit of a cultural Phenom what do you think it is about this show that is tapped into it when people ask me I say I love the Y Lotus I'm obsessed with it and they say why I have a if they ask me about Game of Thrones I can kind of explain why I'm obsessed with it and what is it about this show in your view that is sort of tapped into this kind of zeit guys it's turned it into kind of this Phenom I should clarify I think if HBO was Pitch the show they probably would have passed because to their credit they basically called Mike White and said this is July of 2020 when Co had started they said do you have an idea that you could do in a bubble that can be on the air in 2021 will do it and Mike said yeah I got one and he didn't even have an idea he basically had to come up with something in a month and they basically sent us off to Hawaii they had no idea what it was they just trusted in Mike and we came back with season one Lotus but I think there's an honesty to the show that people respond to I think you know Mike White I think is a genius and he he's an observer of humanity an observer of of character and I think he writes from a very authentic place you know Mike we both love reality tv Mike loves reality TV and I think he's tapping into what people love about reality TV which is every person's not all good or bad or funny or dramatic we're all you know most people are all flavors and so I think he writes characters in that way and people really respond to that and I also think he talks about culture and and The Human Experience in a very real authentic way and a lot not a lot of people are doing that give us a little bit of your backstory how did you get to this position and what exactly does an executive producer do like what have you been doing for the last three or four months yeah so I'm from from DC grew up there and and uh you know I I wanted to a producer since I was a little kid I I came across a movie shooting in a mall in DC called first kid the Sinbad movie when I was a kid and somehow talked my way onto the set I met the director I met Sinbad I met the the other stars and I kind of was like this is what I want to do when I grew up so I started in the mail room at UTA and and really wanted to start at the bottom really wanted to kind of um see all all aspects of the business and I was very fortunate to meet Mike White almost 20 years ago um when I was at UTA and I've been working with them ever since and you know that my parents don't know what a producer does I don't think anyone really knows what a producer does but I'm I basically like the glue guy I'm I'm every project requires something different you know I do a show called jury duty that's on Amazon that's a show that I originated I'm intricately involved in the edit intricately involved in the production casting all aspects of that White Lotus is really Mike's The Genius of Mike of White Lotus and I'm there to support him you know I'm I'm very involved in you know every aspect of White Lotus when Mike needs me so for the last 3 months you know we've been in post I give notes on the edit you know I I I push on HBO whether it's about music release date marketing materials promotion I'm involved in you know all aspects of that and and really you know I'm I'm there every day with Mike we you know we start we start on it together from the origination to scouting to Casting to locations to to hiring of crew and and I'm there every day on set so I kind of just you know I'm there I'm there to solve issues and prevent issues from coming up when I think about the White Lotus there seems to be a theme or a certain I don't know someone told me that it's about it's a different seven deadly sins what what are the what are the creative anchors you try to hold on to if you ended up doing a season 8 what do you think would be the the common themes that would still static through season 8 that are present uh in one two and three I I think part of what makes the show even in a thir season like our you know our ratings came out yesterday and the show was up I think 92% from season one so sorry from season two up 40% week to week and I think part of that is you know what the Thematic approach and what the idea of the show is is evolving so I don't think we'd be able to say what you know Season 8 is I think Mike is kind of respond to culture and I think season 1 was definitely a reaction to what Mike was feeling in the moment with culture and and I think season 2 which was kind of this you know um it was a bedroom farce but it really took on sexual politics was a a response to Something Mike was feeling I think season 3 is much darker than the previous seasons and it's a little bit more existential and there's a little more angst and I think that speaks to how Mike was feeling in the moment and and I think he's tackling existential themes and existential ideas so it's always going to feel current in that way but what we're tackling I think is a reaction to something that Mike is feeling I'm curious with casting because when I first saw the lineup I how do you when you think of a character and you think okay does an aelia go Parker posy would be the right person for this or does she read and you decide that she brings life to the character I would think casting would be such a is it an art or a science how do you go about it I mean it's it's a question I think it's an it's both possibly I think it's definitely something that evolves and you kind of learn and you kind of sharpen your instincts but it really for us the approach from season 1 has always been don't give into the temptation to just cast someone you know famous or a name and really approach it with an authenticity in casting people that feel like they embody the characters and the traits of the storytelling cuz really Mike's what's genius about Mike's storytelling it's not really they're characters but those characters are just Pawns in a bigger thematic idea and each storyline is meant to resonate on a deeper level than just a character story there's a there's a deeper theme to each story that's being told and so you really need characters that immediately visually you get it and they feel authentic to the story that's being told so you know 98% of the actors audition there's someone like Parker posie who Mike has known for a very long time and and has you know a body of work that speaks to exactly what we were looking for so someone like Parker did an audition but you know everyone else on this season did and I think we go into to Casting kind of blind to names we're not looking for names we're looking for the right person um and it's a process and I think the science to it really is kind of never deviating from those ideas don't try to get seduced by big names really be thorough don't rush and feel 100% confident whenever we make a decision and it's a long process the casting process is is 10 weeks usually it's grueling meith Tucker who's our casting director Mike went to college with I've been working with over 20 years so we have a great shorthand she's amazing and and HBO you know they're they're great Partners where they trust us and even if they might not agree with a casting decision they you know they always give us the authority to do creatively what we feel is best you've been in the business for a couple decades describe give us your sense you're I mean my understanding as an executive producer at the end of the day you're you've got to have business acument you got to understand budgets you got to understand Trends you're basically managing a small business that kind of gets funding starts up and then closes down and then you hopefully monetize it what do you see are the major Trends in Hollywood and how has that shifted your approach to the business you know I've been in the business 21 22 years now and and I think for me what I've seen is you know there was an expansion and now a contraction um and I think the biggest difference between you know 2025 and 2023 I would say as a producer 2023 you could go out with a project and maybe it's you know 50/50 it sells and you're going to put a lot of energy and time into that and 10% chance it gets made it's a flyer and I'm gonna kind of take 10 projects out six of them might be Flyers like that those projects aren't selling right now so I'm really trying to kind of refocus my energy and refocus my time on projects I feel 80% about 90% about that when I take it out to the marketplace they're going to sell and you know that contraction feels like a just a natural contraction there was possibly too many shows being made and those shows weren't working and I think there was just a you know it made it hard for shows to break out so for me as a producer you kind of just got to ride the wave I think to be a producer you have to be an optimist I think every producer would tell you that so I wake up every morning going today is the day that my projects going get green light I'm gonna come out with a great idea that you know this show or movie is going to be a hit and I approach every day in that way and so because I take that approach I don't really change what I'm doing for better or worse I really I look for ideas and I look for writers or actors that I'm passionate about in themes I'm passionate about and that's how I approach every project I don't I don't really kind of view the marketplace on a in a broader sense and kind of try to game the system I just try to find things that I'm excited about and that's really you know to take it back to White Lotus that's really all White Lotus was was Mike telling stories that he was passionate about casting people he was excited about and not trying to think about how do I make a hit or how do I you know speak to a broader audience I want to put forward to Theses or observations as an outsider who like I like to think I understand economics I'm fascinated with the industry and you respond to each of them the first thesis is that what Japan did to Detroit kind of Netflix is doing to Los Angeles and that is I read that of the $18 billion content budget that Netflix spends annually on content that for the first time more than half of it is being spent overseas and it's the same time I also read the Productions down 40% in La is the globalization of the media industry that's checking Capital kind of out of America specifically out of Los Angeles is it as evident as I think it is maybe you that's a great question you again for as long as I've been the business production in LA in California has been an issue I think it's you know not having the numbers in front of me and maybe those numbers production in Los Angeles has decreased in the last you know 15 20 years which probably has but I think it's always been an issue and and you know there's there's a push and pull right so you want more people to be employed you want more shows to be made you want more movies to be made that requires certain amount of budget and then when you have a budget in front of you you want to make 10 movies as opposed to eight the best way to accomplish that may be to go to Canada to go to you know ex country that op Bulgaria Hungary Eastern Europe that are offering certain rebates so you can make more for less and so I think it's a it's a fundamental issue and it's something that California needs to look at is how can we get proper tax credits production credits to keep Productions in Los Angeles because you know as a producer I know I live in Los Angeles this where my family is this is where my friends are I want to be in Los Angeles so I'm not incentivized to leave but if a if Netflix or Paramount or Sony or HBO comes to me and they say you have $10 million to make this movie or show and I'm looking at the math and it I can get 15 extra days of I go to Toronto and I can and you know and I can pay more for cast or pay more for directors if I go to Vancouver it's it's a it's an easy decision to be honest you know even though it makes my life harder and it's not something I want to do and so it is so much easier to make movies and shows in Los Angeles full stop but until we solve the production you know tax credit issue I think this will always be a conversation yeah both cities you mentioned you mentioned two cities in Canada is Canada is that your go-to if you're talking about Talent versus economics or stack rank it what do you think are the most popular places on a risk adjusted basis when you look at cost versus access to talent and beautiful locals I've been fortun I've shot in every tax I've shot Montreal Toronto Vancouver Atlanta New Orleans or Louisiana like I've I've shot in every one of these prominent rebate cities you know the thing as a producer what you're weighing is there's always weather weather's always a concern and an issue and each of these cities have different challenges you know Los Angeles again is the beauty of of La is give or take maybe a month or two you're going to get great weather but then you're also looking at local crew local casting and does that City have you know a crew base and a talent actor base for you know for these smaller parts that it makes it worthwhile to shoot there you know I'm I'm doing a movie for Netflix this summer we're going to be shooting in New York New Jersey there's a really prominent rebate there um now in New Jersey I know that a lot of Productions are going there and so that for me would be number one um I've had a lot of success in Atlanta and in New Orleans Louisiana I think those are both really great cities to be honest my favorite City I've shot in I've shot a movie there and the TV show there is Montreal crew is amazing Montreal is the best city in North America great great food great night life and so Montreal is actually a really it's funny cuz I Mike White and I shot a movie there Brad status this Ben Stiller movie which I think you would love Scott and I've since told a lot of friends to go shoot Productions there and it's a really they have a great tax credit great crew great local actors and and great lifestyle so second thesis that the opacity of information when you run something on Netflix you don't know how other than them renewing the season you don't really know how well it's doing Jennifer Aniston's agent knew that friends was the anchor to the Thursday night and could kind of reverse engineer to how much ad Revenue they're making and had the confidence to go ask for a million dollars per episode per cast member and now that you really don't know what's working and what isn't it's essentially what I perceive is a giant flow of capital from the industry from the human capital to the shareholders of Netflix am I oversimplifying what's going on there I have a controver controversial take on this because this is an issue that I've it a lot and i' and I've been on all sides of this so I had a show on NBC called Superstore and I knew the numbers we did 113 episodes it's it's the most successful sitcom on NBC in the last 15 years 20 years and I knew all the numbers and we would renegotiate every two years whatever it was and I wouldn't say that we won the negotiations right I did a show for Amazon called jury duty did not know any of the numbers we're not told a single number and when we renegotiated I would I would I feel like I won that negotiation and to me it's it boils down to as as a you know a seller of product in the supply and demand world of Hollywood you don't even need to know the numbers because you can feel the numbers when you negotiate and ultimately the success of a movie or show in my opinion having that information doesn't really has not benefited me in my anecdotal experience the the energy from the buyer will dictate how well you're showed it because I saw the numbers on Superstore and I thought it did amazing but what I discovered in my negotiations is it wasn't profitable for them and it still is unprofitable I'm being told and that's a different conversation to the funky number you know the funky economics of Studio accounting but you can feel the energy in a negotiation when on the other side if your show is working or not and so without knowing any of my jury duty numbers I know the show worked by the nature of the negotiation and how bad they wanted that show for a second season that's my my opinion and and I know that might seem ignorant but it again like having information is never really benefited me in White Lotus too like in in our renegotiation season to season we don't have the full scope of that show's numbers but I know it's done well by the nature of HBO's desire and demand for for us to do another season we'll be right back support for Prof G comes from

is going to be today or someone starting out in the business any kind of macro thoughts on their career that this part of the business is going to be the easiest place to find employment this is the medium the size of the screen any advice to a you know a 22-year-old Dave starting in this business what what do you see as the major themes and how does someone foot their efforts to trying to take advantage of those themes in the industry yeah I mean that's a great question and I I you know do a lot of coffees and zooms with people and my advice to anyone starting the business would be if there's anything else on Earth you can do I would go do that so so your general advice is don't yeah my advice like because I think this is a it's and you talk about a lot about this I know and it's an incredibly difficult business and I think making a living in this business has gotten harder and harder for whatever reason and I think that I this is something that I wake up every day and I I live it I breathe it it's something I love and I feel incredibly fortunate to doing and I can't imagine doing anything else on Earth and unless you have that kind of energy and passion for creating content I would go do something else and I look back and I like you know think about my personal journey and I don't even like there's no straight line to it it's just a series of decisions that I made in the moment that somehow worked out and and I think there's a there you know and again there's an incredible amount of rejection in NOS and closed doors on my journey and I remember people would say to me oh you're so lucky and I would think to myself well you sure maybe but you also haven't seen the insane amount of hours and dedication and sacrifice I put into this in my 20s and 30s to get to this level and still you know something like White Lotus happened as a result of covid and a bunch of series of fortunate events that led to White Lotus and so it's not like there's no straight line and there's no advice I can give other than go do something else unless you are willing to kind of sacrifice your you know seven days a week and most of your life to this business and you know I was I was reading an article yesterday there was you know some article about this like you know 35-year-old podcaster that created a a network about True Crime that she's you know clearing like 40 million of profit every year and I found myself thinking about like uh if I'd given myself like advice on my younger self i' be like get into P you know you're you to the business but I'm like get into some some other New Media business because you know it's making filming TV is really challenging really heartbreaking and again just difficult to make a living and I'm and I'm and I'm saying this as someone who's incredibly fortunate and who's doing it and that that would be my advice a little cynical and a little little Bleak but it's true what have you worked on that surprised you most of the upside or the downside in terms of its commercial SU success like what what did you think was going to be bigger than it was and what was bigger than you thought it might be I mean jury duty is a good example and I don't know if you've seen it it's an interesting anecdote it originated just I was watching Netflix documentary on a couch had a colel of an idea called a producer friend it's about 2017 2018 we started talking about it we kind of came up with this concept brought it to writers it was a long journey when we went out and pitched it basically everyone passed except for the woman Lauren Anderson who was taking over a a segment of Amazon it was called at that point it was called IMDb TV the rebranded to freey so you know Amazon proper had passed on it it didn't fit their algorithm or whatever their calculus was and we just so happened to have perfect timing with this woman Lauren Anderson who who basically invested in us and bet on us this it's a it was a crazy concept it was a verbal pitch 10 minutes and they gave us you know a healthy amount of money to make a very experimental show and you know when the show launched no one watched it and they got bad reviews and didn't it didn't really work and then over a weekend someone on Tik Tok posted about it and all of a sudden it just became this hit and it moved from freee to Amazon proper and then was a hit on Amazon and so it was I still don't know why it worked and maybe people just maybe it was so original and and but it it kind of came out of nowhere and and um that one surprised me the most I think you know I did a show called White House plumbers with Woody harl fantastic and Justin yeah and that one and that one was a surprise I think the time when that came out I think we just kind of it came out too late I think that one was delayed because of Co and I'm really proud of that show and I I think by the time it came out people were over you know non-fiction historical non-fiction and and I feel like over you know overs satz with political dramas and that one I feel like should have been worked better than it did and I'm still very proud of it and that one you know that that was one I also worked on for 10 years before it was made and that one was really personal to me and and I wish had done better but again there's no Rhyme or Reason you can't really time it and that's why it's a tough business you can't really you can all you can do is control what you make and whether audience is find it or not is so out of your control and really comes down to a lot of times time in the universe as my listeners will know I bring on guests mostly to talk about me so let's get let's bring this back to me uh so I met I met David through a mutual friend Ben Stiller you've been friends with him for several decades I've only been friends with Ben for a couple years and we hit it off and you reached out to me and said is there any way I could talk you into doing a small cameo in the White Lotus and my first response was well how much would that cost me and so I'm super excited uh uh David was generous enough to include me in a small role where I'm will you explain it who am I David I want to say one thing your podcasts both of them are you know if you my Spotify rap it's number one both your podcasts and if I had to Define my personality or someone ask me who who kind of encapsulates your personality and point of view on the world it's Scott Galloway and so so me that did with Ben was a was a for me meeting my number one celebrity crush and I have a I have a text thread with six of my guy friends and we've been texting every day for 15 years I want to say and it is it is the embodiment of male friendship it's it's everything it's every every concept but you are a frequent point of conversation and this is the ultimate compliment I think we use your we will reference you or use one of your articles or something you said on one of the podcasts to prove a point and so just so you are you are my friends my friend Neil Paris Joe P Neil sha like these guys we talk about you every day probably so meeting you was a big Big Thrill for me getting to you know developing a friendship with you has been a Big Thrill and so we were casting a part for a lawyer and we needed someone that you know was kind of could deliver emotionalist very just to the point dialogue and so we were on set and I said to Mike I'm like what about Scott callow and and Mike's a huge fan of yours also and so you know I was thrilled when you said yes I was nervous that maybe he wouldn't be able to deliver and so if you don't mind I'll tell you the story so we were in I was in kosami you sent me the first your first recordings I listened to it I almost [ __ ] my pants cuz I was like I don't know if this sucks this sucks I don't know if this is going to fly and I think I had then I heard you mention it on on I think on pivot and so I was extra nervous that I was going to somehow disappoint you and I did not want to disappoint you and so I I called I think I got maybe I was back in LA or might have been still in Thailand and I called you and I said would you mind possibly re-recording you know I was trying to be subtle about it I didn't want you to think that I was nervous you you were so managing me like it's great but we think it can be better yeah yeah I I sent it to the editor the editor is like I don't know if this is going to work and then I was like I had the you know I will give myself credit I had the smart idea of sending Jason Isaacs over to your apartment just you know I was like maybe Jason could help you read with you and I remember I was like very anxious I was like Jason call me as soon as you get out of there Jason called me and he goes we did an hour of takes it could be all dog [ __ ] maybe maybe there's something in there and I have to say genuinely you are great in the show in that in those hour of recordings we found gold and as soon as Mike heard it he loved it honestly like it was it was like okay this is great I know Mike told me he wrote you so you so you know I'm not full of [ __ ] and and I will be honest like in all my text read I was like keeping everyone updated I'm like we might have to cut scull from the show I'm I'm freaking out I love that talk about it too and so I was really nervous but glad it worked out and I I'm I'm hoping this is the beginning of a long Hollywood career for you and you become and when you win an Emmy you have to thank be on stage that's all I ask well you you don't know this I've had five TV shows already Dave they've all been canceled within two or three weeks so I have a faer podcasting but I'll give you my side of the story I I thought I did an amazing job and I sent it to and you were very supportive and I remember telling my my I take care oh my God I killed it I was so good and then I got the message from you saying we think we can do better and this handsome guy shows up to my apartment with movie star good looks I didn't know who Jason Isaac was I didn't put the two and two together I'm like I'm like dude you're the guy from The Patriot and he's he's actually one of these very accomplished British actors and by the way I think the white L is the first two episodes I think he kind of owns the screen whenever he's on it I think Parker is amazing because she's just so quirky but I think I think Jason kind of owns the screen whenever he's on it but anyways he came over he was on his way to a tennis lesson this like handsome guy and he's like I'm here to help and we went into my studio and for an hour I'd hit a line and he'd go like okay this is the situation I'm about to fire you and you don't know what to say and you're a little scared hit the line and then he like no hit it again dial it up and I walked away or he would say to me this guy's such an [ __ ] and you just found out he's like okay that's good but now this guy's such an [ __ ] and you just found out he's having an affair with your wife he's like let it sink in let it sink in now hit it and he made me do this over and over over with different situations and different emotions and different feelings and I walked away from that hour with such an appreciation for just how [ __ ] hard it is what you do because I thought oh I've I've been in boardrooms I know how to own a room I know how to deliver something unemotionally that's not it that's not enough in Hollywood to really get across the there's so much more that goes into it and people don't appreciate just how [ __ ] difficult it is to bring out and the emotions and the resonance and the logic and move an audience and I'm not saying I'm not saying that scene was able to do it but you're able to do it and so are other creatives and when this guy walked out of my house my tech guy was there Drew and he's on the line now and I remember saying to Drew I'm not sure but I think that guy just turned chicken [ __ ] into chicken salad and he was so good this is an actor I don't even I don't I'm not sure he's even director before but he was in my face sweating burning calories giving me weird strange advice to try and get my voice up down try and put me in the right frame and I remember thinking what these people do whatever they're making they're not making enough because what this is is hard and it was such an Illuminating experience for me so uh thank you for that it gave me a new appreciation for the art form because I think a lot of people think that acting is just like showing up and being who you are oh my God it's not it was one of the most difficult taxing hours I've ever had it was really um I can't imagine what it's like to be on set and have all this Alchemy and it's not working and then to try to coach people through it it's got to be you know you are juggling I would think just a ton of plates except the plates are are actors directors cinematographers it must be just be incredibly difficult your thoughts daav imagine that EXP with 200 people looking at you and you know you're the the stress of a schedule trying to get through the scene losing light and all of that and for actors to be able to perform on set under that pressure and deliver Great Performances it is a it is a true talent and is not easy but you know it's funny Jason Isaac is an incredibly accomplished guy and he loves acting he like I think he took so much pleasure in that hour he spent with you I think he like really he's the kind of guy who would talk about acting and would be acting 24 hours a day if someone would pay him or he would do it for free honestly but yeah I have you know I I've been in I make little cameos and and most of the stuff I do and I've been I pop up in White Lotus and every time I'm on set and I'm in a scene and I don't have any dialogue usually it's kind of you know I'm doing some sort of action I'm like thank [ __ ] God I don't want to be an actor because it is a hard hard job to kind of and also to give yourself to a camera and be that vulnerable but you know it also speaks to how talented directors are to be able to manage that you know you know everyone has an ego right and so you're basically going up to someone and going that was kind of shitty can you do it a different way or your instincts are off do it my way and how do you deliver that in a way that doesn't offend them and you know get what you want out of the actor but yeah it's a it's tough It's all it's it's a tough business and and again it speaks to you know Great Performances are not easy to come by so just as we wrap up here a lot of young men listen to the show and they hear someone successful like you and they think I'd like to be that guy can you talk a little bit about uh growing up who are really the big influences in your life people or kind of situations that sort of Change Your Life yeah I this is something that I you know I really love about your work and what you talk about and something that really resonates with me and you know I I my parents are both Hungarian immigrants and my my grandparents are all Holocaust Survivors and you know my father is some someone who you know he didn't speak the language when he immigrated from Budapest he ended up in Montreal and eventually in in America but he's someone my grandfather made sure my father you know really learned what work ethic is and an appreciation for work and that's something my father instilled to me and he was probably my first Mentor but I had a English teacher and a basketball coach named Mike Hibbs who changed my life and introduced me to storytelling and it was so tough on me from a place of love and in a place that really responded so when I started at UT and I was in the mail room nothing was ever going to be as difficult and challenging as my basketball coach and English teacher and how he pushed me and that male mentorship and really changed my life and I told my this you know my English teacher Mike Hibbs when I was in in high school that I was one day going to fly him out to a Premiere when I make my first movie and I flew him out for the White Lotus from Mir two weeks ago and it was almost 30 years to when I told him I would do that and having him there was so moving for me and I think moving for him and and you know he's someone who's dedicated his life to mentoring young men whether it's on the basketball court or or in the English in in you know English class and and I think for me I wanted him to him to see what his mentorship meant to me and what I was able to accomplish and I feel very fortunate I had that relationship and you talk a lot about this and and even my my text thre I was referencing my my six Buddies we push each other every day and those friendships really they ground you and they keep you humble but they also push you in a way and I would say that that's that's really why I'm here today honestly talking to you is were those those relationships and whenever I i't known you for that long but you're it seems like you're wasn't like you know eight time zones away how do you and I know very little about your personal life how do you and maybe you don't how do you establish any sort of momentum or attraction in a relationship I don't I mean I'm single I'm 44 and and you know that's part that's a part of my life I feel like I've sacrificed to kind of get to where I am currently and and I've tried to maintain those relationships but part of being a producer and part of being a producer is actually there doing the work it almost becomes all-encompassing so it's hard at night to give yourself emotionally or in the morning before work CU you're either your tank is at zero or you're distracted and that's something that you know I've that's something that I haven't figured out also in my life and how to find that balance and something that I'm you know I need to work on and be better at because you know and it's and you know I have another really great mentor one of the partners at CIA who right before I went to go do White Lotus season 3 said to me you sent me an email and he said you know I really I'd love for you to come by CA and see me before you leave and I thought he was going to talk about some work stuff and I went to his office and he said um you know I don't want to talk about work you're doing great and I'm really proud of you what I want to talk about is your personal life and the fact I don't want you to end up like me and how can we change that part of your life and he you know and he took an interest and that's you know that really meant a lot to me and it's something that I've been thinking about and how do I how do I find that balance and that's something I haven't figured out yet and what do you do for sort of meditation or relaxation or just to stay kind of centered give the amount of anxiety and insecurity in your industry I mean I'm not just I I listen to Pivot I listen I'm not kidding I'm not joking that's what everybody needs I'm not joking like I I'm not kidding when I say you know all my downtime I every flight you you kind of narrated my experience in Thailand you know we I must have been on 45 flights last year you know in in and out of Thailand and I list I would listen to Prof G or your pivot I mean I for me you know I watch a lot of reality TV to be honest and and listen to podcast and and you know finding a good hobby or getting into meditation something I need to also figure out I I have a lot of work to do on myself is basically what I'm learning from this conversation but I really I haven't found that that thing yet that helps me fully disconnect because you know even listening to Pivot or listening to you know that to me is partly is that work i i b I've taken a lot of good stock advice from you you've made me some good money so I owe you a dinner next time me see you but I think I owe you no when my kids when my kids hear me in the White Lotus I owe you I haven't told them I can't tell you how excited I haven't told them we're going to watch it it's going to be you you have brought you are going to bring so much credibility to me amongst my 14 and 17y old so I owe you a couple just a couple more serious questions before we go anyone in your life you lost you or that's not around that you wish you could say something to yeah I I when I was uh when I was working on ta and I was an assistant and and I and that was one of the best experien of my life being in the going from the mail room working for a partner David Kramer there who who also was a huge Mentor like he was a huge Mentor in my life and he would every Monday morning I'd come in and he he'd say how many scripts do you read this weekend and if I you know and I would say six he goes that's not good enough eight that's not good enough 10 you know so he really pushed me my work ethic and I met this young assistant named James cap J Kaplan James Kaplan who was working for these director St and Ferris and we struck up a really amazing friendship and he helped me find the strength to leave UTA and go kind of really pursue my creative dreams and we were starting a company and we we had actually sold our first project we were negotiating a producing deal together and you know we he died suddenly he had a brain aneurysm at 28 and he collapsed and I rushed To Us hospital I was there at his bedside and uh he passed away and and he had just gotten married he just directed his first commercial and again we had just sold our first project and you know I dedicate every movie and show I do I I put him in the in the dedication and and I think about him every day and and for me I don't think I'd be I definitely want to be where I'm at now without him and that relationship and and we talked every day and we were such a great sounding board and it was such a huge loss and so I mean know I wish he was here to kind of see what I've been able to accomplish and for me to tell him I love him and how much he meant to me and how much you know his support as a friend you know during some tough times and in my 20s really really helped me and last thing uh anybody in this can be serious not serious you'd just love to give a shout out to and have them be surprised that if and when they hear about this you just are thinking just something someone you're thinking about and anything you'd like to say to them and it'll get back to them yeah I mean Neil Paris it's really my group of friends because we talk about you every day Neil Paris Neil Shaw Joe Port rvy Patel uh Evan Wier May arti that's my my tech thread we you you like I told you you come up almost daily and I think they were the first persons first people I told that I was coming on the show I think there's probably a you know like in every great group of male friends they're they're probably jealous they're competitive but also proud of me and so I think uh I'm really uh yeah I think and also each of them are like you better shout us out on the podcast well box checked David bernad is the Emmy winning executive producer for HBO's The White Lotus he's also known for producing Uncharted jury duty enlightened and I didn't know this White House plumber he joins us from Los Angeles David you are so far far ahead of where I was I didn't appreciate just how precious and wonderful it is to have to kind of the friend group you have and what you're going to find is that you are the average and their signs of this of those Five Guys and so you guys building and loving each other it just it's it's it's not only incredibly rewarding it's a smart thing to do because you guys will progress and you'll fall together and I'm telling you in 15 years you're going to look back hopefully on your kids and your career and you're going to feel great but it almost means nothing it's almost as if it doesn't happen without that text group and
