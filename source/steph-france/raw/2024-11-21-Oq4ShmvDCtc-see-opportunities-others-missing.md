# See Opportunities Others Missing

Published: 2024-11-21

to create a startup you need to find a business idea what is a business idea well it's a good problem to solve in a promising Market all right but what does that mean exactly how do you know it's a good problem how do you know it's a good market and what if the problem has already being solved by so many other competitors like if it's the case in pretty much every Market I mean we live in a saturated world and the amount of advice is out there to start a business is insane and it seems that is very easy to find a business idea and to be honest I'm also guilty of that because that's the topic of few of my videos but in this video I really wanted to take time to think deeply and break down the principle of creating value and especially creating value in a world where every single Market is saturated where every time you think you have a good idea turns out you have five people that have done it before and it's already a crowded market so how can you still find the opportunities that are out there because there are opportunities and it they will continue to be so how can you integrate that as a mental framework so what whenever you are scrolling the web finding a new website anything you will come across you will have this framework in mind so you can spot the good opportunities you can spot the market gaps so if that sounds good to you then let's go into it right now first of all let's define what is a market capap to make it very simple you can think of it as a very good business idea but let me read to you this definition and we will come back to it at the end of this video and it should become a lot more clear than it will now but let's read it right now so a market Gap is the bridge between what exist and what people truly need or want it's a chance to solve a problem or bring something new to a market where current Solutions don't work well don't exist or for short of customer expectations a market Gap can come from a met need overlooked segment behavioral changes new business models or emerging technologies that might sound a little bit confused but bear with me we move on to the next step which is to look at how traditionally Founders look at finding business ideas this is probably and you probably already have heard about that many times but this is the main mistake that most Founders especially technical Founders that want to build a solution um before validating an idea this is the the mistake they are mostly making so the idea is okay I I want to build solution then I'm just making sure there is a problem and then I look for who can I set it to so basically if you want an example let's build an e-commerce platform yeah sure people need an eCommerce platform but too bad the market is saturated I mean who can compete with Shopify right now unless there is a huge change in the world or unless you have billions of dollars to invest anyway that's the basic mistake you absolutely want to void now let's have a look at a different approach which works pretty well looking at the problem then finding the market then finally build the solution so for the example it's very hard to create good creatives for meta advertising so you just realize that a lot of people are struggling for that turns out e-commerce brand struggle a lot with that and the current solution suck so you realize there is a problem and you find out that by doing market research that a lot of e-commerce brands are struggling with that okay cool so let's create the best platform for e-commerce brand to generate creatives based on their existing assets that sounds like a good business idea obviously I didn't do any research and this is pretty broad but this is an example for the mental process the the chain of thought until you get to a solution now let's have a look at the best way to think about it I first look at a market then I study the market find a problem and then build the solution for this program as the example Ecommerce growth is projected to double in the next 10 years let's focus on this one turns out Ecom entrepreneurs are struggling with stock for forecasting cool then let's create a simple tool that shows restocking inventory needed in real time based on orders in previous period this is a very accurate problem for a very specific market and it's impossible I am from e-commerce that's why I know that I I found myself in the position of looking for such a tool and I couldn't find something really good obviously it exists but typically this is something it's that is impossible to find if you are not already studying the market that's why when you decide I go into the Ecommerce market then you start studying the market finding the different problems talking with people within the market in different ways that I already explained in different other videos and that I will continue to explain how you can talk to the right people at scale but that's not the topic of this video the the point here is that if you gather enough information and there are plenty of informations out there if you gather enough information then you can find that so this kind of idea to go back to this one is pretty easy to come up with and if it's easy to come up with it means that plenty thousand if not hundred of thousands of people are coming up with the same idea when but when you start looking at the market and going deep and deep into the real struggle that entrepreneurs or your potential customer is facing then you start coming up with Insight from the market and you start narrowing down what kind of business idea really could work all right so that's for the traditional approach now we are going into to the very interesting part the new value creation first let's have a look at how to create new demand something that is not existing yet and the core principle stays the same as you can see you have Market problem solution the same thing as we have seen just before but you have something additional the new Paradigm what is a new paradigm this is something that is happening in the world that is not coming from you but that drastically changes the way things go and it could be so many different things so let's have a look at the list I created and here are all different examples just to illustrate TR U what it could be so the most obvious is a new technology and you are probably aware that AI came around a few years ago and it has already drastically changed U the business landscape but that's not it this is not like AI is a a new parading it is indeed but you have many other new parading for example uh the idea of vertical llm at some points in the past years it has been very easy to um to train a model to train a model on new data this allows companies to train a model specifically for a use case that wasn't possible only with AI it was possible with AI plus the ability to train a model another example that I didn't put here but could be um a new not even a new but let's take one that is very familiar uh GPT Vision I mean the the vision model for from open AI that can see what's that that can recognize a picture basically you do that easily in chat GPT this already has been something that can that is considered as a new paradig something we couldn't do before but there is another one which is when this comes becomes available through an API which means you can create systems create tools code that is using this system then the amount of potential use case is unlimited but still when you get to this technology you still need to find a Market within this Market to find a problem and then within and all of that becomes Your solution the solution is not only the new technology the solution would be the new technology coupled with a market that could need it to solve a problem that they actually have but it all starts by this new technology and that's why it's new value creation and you creating new demand you are selling something that didn't exist before let's move on to the other paring new trend this is it's more if you if you know about uh Market desire big Market desire uh Mass Market desire let's say uh Google Trend you're probably familiar with Google Trend but you can see how people are searching for something and you can see that sometimes people start searching more for a specific thing for example few years ago meditation was one so at some point there is a catalyst something it could be um um sorry if I if I if I pronounce wrong his name but Dr Hu huberman the podcaster that is um that has been the Catalyst for uh a a new way to live like more healthy more aware of your health and and that has created a new paradigm for businesses to thrive from meditation has been one and any new way of thinking in the markets is a new paradigm that creates new markets that have new problem that you can build solution for then you also have more short time trends like Tik Tok Trends now it goes so fast for Trend to uh to start and to go down that's why I prefer to look at longterm Trends rather than a very high growth and and going down but Tik Tok is something um for example there is a YouTuber um that I came across that is has created created an App about stop how to stop vaping why because he found the trend on Tik Tok and he was experimenting experiencing this program so he said let's create an up and it worked it worked because he found the trend there and he promoted it there and people wanted that because that was the solution to their current problem so he just joined these people where they are where they were and he created the solution for them I don't know for how long it will last but at least uh it worked okay new painful regulation there are plenty in different Industries for example ggpr I don't know the English version I aware of the French one but I think this one is the Privacy especially in Europe that have had created such a mess for businesses basically suddenly you needed to uh to have the cookie Banner to explain everything to your customers uh to to have so many rest ition how you cons you keep the data of your customers that has created a lot of businesses that came up and say hey I I can make it make your life easy um for you to follow this rule this new rule new business new demand because of a new paradig okay now a new data set is available when a data set becomes public if it can be used usefully to another businesses then you can create the access to it that fits their need for example here it's air quality data um there are plenty of apps that are showing the pollution in the air at a certain moment at certain point in the world this is only possible because there is a data set that is available either it's free or it's paid but this create a new opportunity before this data set you couldn't create this app and therefore no one needed this app because they didn't know it existed but once it was available people thought about this possibility even though no one was asking for it imagined a future where it was available they created it turns out it was a good idea and people needed that I just uh put AI scrapping here as well it's not specific example but but it's more uh that you can use Ai and use crapping tools not even on AI but to create your own data sets just by scrapping the web and then use these data sets to create a business from okay new insight or belief this is not really a complete Paradigm but it's more from a personal understanding a personal vision of the future as I mentioned just before if you have beliefs if you are reading a lot informing yourself a lot and you start creating a vision of the future in your mind then you can build the products that people will need in this future but it's not easy to do um and you can be wrong you are most likely wrong basically or you can also have uh I don't even know know if I can say that an Insider Insight uh whatever it's if you know someone that gives you a piece of information that wasn't available for the public then this is a new paradig because you are in a position Now to create a product that you know might work uh and you still need to find the market and the right program and then finally you build a solution but at least you start from uh something that gives an unfair advantage and then you have Micro trends for example uh if you follow if should go on Trend Hunter um this kind of websites they are talking like very globally on what are where is the world going and when you start understanding that then it goes back to your personal vision of the future what you're believing in and now you are creating the tools that people will need in the future not now soon all right so that's it for the creating new demand and honestly this one is probably not the uh if you find one then good you should go for it but that's not the easiest way and not the it's probably the more the riskiest one I don't know if I can say riskiest the more risky one right uh now my favorite one uh and probably the one I I would I would look for in most of my videos um I already did and in the future as well is capturing existing demand and actually I'm even going to say rerouting existing demand so better like that so you find a market that has problems and you find a good problem for a good Market you know and you don't care if there there are a lot of competitors on the contrary this is exactly what you want you want a market where people are facing for but what you want to do is to create a differentiation once you find the differentiation then you create the solution let's go through this list and this doesn't mean that it should be only one it could be several differentiation and by the way it could also be starting with the parading and then even finding a differentiation everything could be um put together it doesn't matter it's for you to to have that in mind okay a new segment in the market let's think about fitness trackers it could be um Smartwatch um just fitness trackers and all the analytics that people are following this is is a huge market and you can go ahead and Tik Tok and you find plenty of ads and apps that are scaling um just selling this kind of product there are plenty of competitors but the market is so huge what about a fitness tracker for seniors for uh people that have different needs so for example it could be uh a very simple analytic that talk about health mod than performance it could be the font can be uh a lot bigger you basically adapt the solution to a specific market so for them in your world you are the only version I don't know if it exists yet it's just came like that uh it's just to give an example again but you can be the best at creating a a fitness tracking for for elderly people because turns out they need it the market is smaller than the global market but for them there is no competitors it's you that's how you rout existing Demand by being the best for a specific segment then new approach to uh the problem this one is pretty big and there are different subcategories so let's start by a new business model I'm going to do recall a video just about business models because um especially for SAS Founders generally it's subscriptions um without really thinking through it but there are plenty of different business models and um just to give two examples paper use is something that is growing and growing people are sick of subscription so for example if uh all the competitors in your Market are selling subscription I then if you come up with a payer use you are re rooting uh the demand because I am exactly that I don't like subscription so I I I'm I don't care about paying more but I just don't want to have in mind that now I'm going to pay every month for how many years I don't know so just that for me position the business that is offering that as the best solution and it's not a big change it's just a business model dat change then you also have something more radical like free plus affiliate basically you don't charge anything but then you are going to find a way to get the money back by using affiliate marketing by generating business for other businesses um I don't want to go into details in in here and it will be the topic for the the video about business models but just the fact of changing the way you monetize is a way to reposition yourself and and rroo a just a part of the demand to you in a saturated Market New marketing this one is you shouldn't because it's tough and you need to be really good but that's very obvious example is liquid death liquid death which is basically water that is scaling like crazy just because of marketing because they're good at it so if your industry is completely boring then being the the cool kid in the industry could be a way to differentiate you can have the same solution but if you have the better message and it's more entertaining and you educate the customer then you are already completely different than your competitors and you can win but be careful with this one new technology now um this is pretty similar to this one new paradigm basically you you can it's yeah it's it's it's pretty similar but the approach is different now it's more like okay I found a market in the I found this problem a lot of people have it and there are a lot of competitor what are the competitors doing that I can do differently because of a new technology we talked previously about new large language model uh that can help me obviously to uh to deliver more value to the customer another example could be a more Simple Technology like um GPS um I don't know I didn't plan that and made research but if you just take the example of um the fitness tracker for Senor then maybe you can include the GPS so I don't there is a system that alerts the the family you know it's just you add something new with another technology to different yourself from the competition then you can also create a new experience a very good example here is dualo which I love and I use and this du Lang is basically like learning a language and that's actually not new that's pretty old but the the experience du Lango delivers good or bad you decide but the the experience that they deliver is completely different now it's game now I can I can do it every day I I I gain a point I can share it with my family and everything they just they didn't change the core things they didn't even find a new segment in the market uh there isn't really a new technology I mean that's just code basically they just changed the approach of delivering the experence delivering the value all right so that's it for the new approach to the program now let's talk about a new premium version there was this example I I didn't check it out but if it's true it's really cool is uh when the the founders of Airbnb were struggling at some point then they went ahead and and meet their customers and and they were asking so what is the three three star experience and so they're like answering so yeah it's a I don't know it's just uh it's fair enough but uh it's not that clean okay what's a festar experience well a five star is a is cool I have it's what I expected I'm happy with that but in their mind it was like no I don't if I have a five star experience then basically no one will share that you know it's not something you really you want to talk about you want more than that so they they went ahead and okay what's the six star experence what's the nine star experence what's 10 what's 11 star experience and then went crazy like okay the they come to pick me up at the the airport and and and there is a parad and and everything is crazy obviously they never built that but the the mental framework of thinking how can I get 11 star to deliver the same service as everybody else is uh is fighting to to win then if you just try to build the 11 star experence that's already a differentiation because no one thinks about that everybody thinks about how can I acquire customers in a better way how can I reduce my cost uh but no one thinks of it doesn't matter the price how can I make it incredible so people will share it that's another one and lastly you have also the new acquisition Channel pretty straightforward also um I don't know let's say you have um a boring business that owns the the market but that generates all the traffic from SEO for example then you can be the one that is taking over on YouTube because you turns out people are looking for it on YouTube too so you don't bother writing blog articles from the get-go you know that everything will be video or you can be the one on Tik Tok or you can be the one that is reaching to every uh micro influencer or everything you just just find a big Market find a place where it's not promoted enough and you decide to own this place so you are not innovating on the solution not in the segment you only innovating on the way to acquire customers all right so I hope it makes sense so far uh we are done with the the reting demand and all the examples so you you have understood that it's the exact same principle it's just that the the change factor is put at a different place and you might be wondering what is this red sentence it's um it's kind of a trick uh that you can use for basically everything something that tells you are you uh in the on the right path when you decide to go for business idea then ask yourself can I be the best in the world for that if it seems impossible then you are not that's not a good business idea you are not you are neither creating new demand nor rerooting existing demand because for all the the examples that I gave you if you ask can I be the best in the world then the answer is yes for all the precise example like for my fitness tracker for example can I be the best fitness tracker for Senor in the world using all the things I talked about differentiation the GPS and everything I guess I can if I focus only on them I guess I can and it's the same for uh new paradig and all the way to differentiate all right so we reached the end of this video and as I told you let's have a look again at the definition of a market Gap now a market Gap is the bridge between what exists and what people truly need or wants that's important it's need or wants maybe that no actually that's funny because I just realized that I could have write differently that people truly need or want or will need exactly it's a chance to solve a problem or bring something new to a market where current solution don't work well don't exist all fall short of customer expectations a market Gap can come from unmet needs Overlook segments Behavior changes new business models or emerging Technologies I just realized and I am simply going to tell you because I didn't include it here um there is also another one that could be here is sometimes you will find um businesses that have a huge demand but the customers are not happy this is what me uh what it means here a market um that don't work for solutions that don't work well this one we haven't talked about it and you can find a lot more in my video um that's called trust pilot how to find hidden niches it's all about that but that's not exactly creating new demand and that's not exactly rerouting existing demand but I hope that this definition now makes more sense at the end of this video as I promised at the beginning if it's the case uh please let me know just tell me in the comments did you learn something or was it just boring here listening to me rumbling about that but for me I know that I had a good time thinking about this concept and I realized that even though it was clicking in my head it was very hard to put it uh in an understandable way um on my figma like that so I hope you like it uh anyway um that's it for today and I see you in the next video bye bye
