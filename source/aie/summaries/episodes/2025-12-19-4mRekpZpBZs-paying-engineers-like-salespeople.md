# Paying Engineers like Salespeople

Arman, the co-founder of 10X, shares insights on a revolutionary compensation model for engineers inspired by performance metrics seen in sales positions.

## Core Thesis
Arman proposes a shift from traditional salary structures to a performance-based model using "story points" to compensate engineers. This model aligns employee incentives with tangible project outcomes, promoting a results-oriented culture that is particularly valuable in tech-focused industries.

## Key Insights
- Many engineers at 10X are compensated based on the completion of "story points," encouraging efficiency and high-quality work.
- The traditional hourly wage model is viewed as inefficient and not conducive to motivating faster output.
- AI solutions have enhanced operational efficiency, notably with a 96% accuracy rate in moderating images, underscoring AI's potential to streamline processes.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Consider adopting a performance-based compensation model for engineers to align incentives with deliverable outcomes.
2. Leverage AI technology to enhance operational efficiency and accuracy within organizational processes.

## Notable Quotes
> "We pay engineers based on the number of story points that they complete."  
> "Our belief is that AI gives people superpowers and it makes all of us smarter, faster, and better at what we do."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
- Integrating performance-based metrics and AI-driven solutions could significantly boost productivity and efficiency, aligning with Wilde Agency's goals of groundbreaking innovation and excellence in project delivery.
