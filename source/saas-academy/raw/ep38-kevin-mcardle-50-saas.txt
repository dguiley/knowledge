call me negative but I don't think people should go into their life thinking I'm going to build four or five businesses and have them all work out even the most serial entrepreneur gets five or six app outs of this I have learned the hard way that businesses take on the personality of their founder for better and for worse if you're a Founder listening to this podcast and and wondering I wonder if Kevin might buy my business one day help us you know figure out a few more of the drivers we love profitable businesses which call me old school I think businesses were created to make money and software doesn't need to be an exception if you are listening right now you're about to get an episode that I think Matt and I would have loved to have heard several years ago because we're sitting down with someone who has acquired over 50 SAS companies in his tenure he has currently assembled $100 million fund for a holding company that exclusively buys and runs software companies and uh we get the honor of sitting down and extracting what does it look like on the buyer side get a peak into someone who evaluates thousands of deals not only is this person uh acquiring but he's a great coach and a mentor in our program to help Founders that are preparing for an exit and then we'll look at the Playbook side if they're going to buy and acquire these companies they turn them into profit engines and ultimately return the money to their investors and so we get a peak into the Playbook there so please welcome to the podcast Kevin McCardell of big band software thanks very much Johnny that was quite the introduction let's start off with where does the name big band come from uh big band so we launched publicly a little over a year ago and but big band's been in the works since December 1st 2022 was when we funded the company um so the the actual funding documents say something random like software aggregate or LLC because we didn't have a name so me and my two partners Jason and Chris were just kind of jamming on names had a Google doc we got to together twice a week not just to talk about names but to like build the business and um we kept there were a lot of musical references in the names that we liked and you guys have done this you know you got to go see if the URLs available and most of them weren't most of the good ones weren't so we just crossed those off um anyway we liked we liked music big band software.com was available um I actually Jason put it on the sheet and I was like I think that's the one and um I like that I kind of joke about it but the URL was available big band. was available too and having made the mistake once of having my email be a very long domain I was like I'm not doing that again um but the more we kind of talked about it and you know worked with a little bit you know a big band is a collection of experts in one thing or another and when they come together they make a more powerful and more joyous noise than any one of them could make individually and our vision for big band is exactly that you know hundreds someday a thousand people that are experts in one thing or another running a portfolio of 100 plus software companies but together we're a stronger unit than individually um so I was snooping you on LinkedIn right um before the did you get bored I'm not that active I mean eventually but um but I saw a quote that I thought was really awesome and you basically said your favorite thing to tell a Founder is I would absolutely love to buy your business and instead of asking you why you said that I would love to know what business that you've bought comes to mind when I say that quote like just walk us through the deal the company whatever you can share I just want to know like what that classic hell yes deal is for you yeah there's there's several that come to mind so it's going to be hard to pick um I've got four kids so I don't want to insult my kids or any other parents by comparing it but it is kind of hard to pick your favorite um the the second part of that quote which I actually like just is what my favorite thing to tell a Founder is I want to buy your business my second favorite thing is I'm not the right buyer for you but let me help you find the right buyer and that gets into kind of the coaching that we do together and why it feels like a calling for me not just a you know obligation through our partnership um so this may sound weird but um a a um connection with the founder is actually fairly important to me not like we have to have the same interests or have a similar background or anything like that or listen to the same music um I have learned the hard way that um businesses take on the personality of their founder for better and for worse so if I connect with somebody and I think they're a good person I think they're a good leader they seem like a honest and trustworthy individual we get along we like hanging out together odds are I'm going to like that person's business because they built it the the only way they know how which is in their own reflection right and if I meet somebody where I don't know just kind of feels weird or I don't trust them or like something's off and there isn't that like connection um it's unlikely I'm going to love their business um so I mean there's lots of stories I could tell a couple like one when I'll give you three examples of of businesses when uh it was I was so fun to say to the founder I'd like to buy your business one of them that comes to mind is a g guy named Moritz Dinger who is a German developer who lives in Paris and I gosh probably first met him seven years ago he was running two businesses at the time and one was for sale and the other one was smaller and growing and um I got got to know him there was a I think there was a broker involed involved in the process and I was just like we got to do this you know the more I learned about him the more I learned about the business the more excited I got um and he was just a great human being and I was like got to say I want to buy your B and this was one of the earlier SAS businesses that I bought so um that was also special it was kind of a bigger check and I felt like we were ready for it um and I'd like I said meritz can I buy both businesses and he's like uh-uh cuz the second one's going to be bigger than the first and you're going to pay me more for that one knew you'd be selling too early and he was right so I got to tell him the same thing we we remained friends uh we were running the first business and it was successful his second business was growing and we were just chatting I remember it was late on a Friday it it was must have been late on Friday for him because he had a drink in his hand I don't know what time he he was in Paris I I was in BC at the time British Columbia and he said he's like you know Kevin we we kind of both know where this other business is going to end up I want you to own it I know that you want to buy it so like maybe we should just cut to the Chase and figure out a deal and I was like yeah let's do that so anyway that was that was one where it's fun you say buying from the same guy twice is special I don't know how often that happens but um and then um another one is a guy that uh has become pretty internet famous in the bootstrapper world uh his name is Arvid call he and his wife built a business called feedback Panda that I was lucky enough to buy um and I didn't really get to know him that well his wife was the CEO and he was a CTO um and they're just wonderful people and it was a a great business and we actually became really good friends afterwards um and it's been cool to see his career he wrote a book about that too Zera sold I think is his book right yeah that's right yeah he's got an amazing podcast he's building in public a new company called pod scan wrote a book that was super successful and it's sort of and I'm not saying this to uh like pump my own tires but like I was on his podcast and he went your introduction was lovely and made me feel good his made me feel embarrassed because he talked for like five minutes about how selling his business to me and my company changed his life and put him on this trajectory and it's just it just makes you feel good like that's that's what I like we're all in this to make money but like the relationships formed are um as or more important and the that that's when it's really a home run with because when there's no obligation for a Founder to stay connected to me or the company but we just stay connected because we we hit it off and we're friends yeah it's Unique that you bring up how important the founder is when you're purchasing it because in most scenarios for most buyers this is when the founder steps out of at least of the role of being the primary Pioneer in the business so for those that aren't aware let's get into what is a holding company and and what is unique about the purchases that you make yeah so what's different about our company the holding company model is that we're not obligated to sell businesses ever so if I were to bucket buyers into three or four categories you mentioned strategic so that's like Adobe buying figma right like it fills a product Gap they're selling to the same users Adobe knows they can take figma and push it through their own distribution channels and sell a bunch of software and based on the multiple that was reported they don't really care how much they pay for it it was like in the billions and like 42 times forward Revenue just bananas so that's the dream for a Founder right if you can sell your business to somebody who doesn't care how much it costs because they know they're going to make money that's great realistically that rare that that is a very small percentage of transactions sell to strategics um a bigger the bigger part of the bell curve is businesses selling to private Equity just broadly speaking so these are um private companies selling to private ownership is the general category of private equity and most people don't realize that like I think the stat is like 70% of the world's companies are privately held they're not on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ um they're not owned by Google um they're owned by private equity and in that case they the the so strategic kind of one broad category Financial buyer is that category so private Equity fits into there our holding company model fits into there um and there's a emerging class of buyers that I want to talk about because I think it's important for your listeners and viewers called search funds so we let me come back to that so private Equity essentially they're looking for return on their money more than likely they want to buy something they want to grow it hold it for four or five years and then sell it after it's grown and sell it for more money hopefully get a higher multiple than what they bought it at that's the whole game it's no no more complic ated than that uh and that's fine a lot of people make tons of money doing that model I don't love that model because having bought businesses and grown them like those are good assets I don't want to you know normal in normal circumstances you don't sell your best assets you sell off crappy assets and you hold on to your best assets but in private Equity they have to sell their best assets because they have to return Capital to their investors the only way that PE funds make money is by you know you double the fund you get 20% of everything over and above with the money returned essentially it's a little bit more complicated than that but um in our model we are under no obligation to return Capital to investors ever so we have a very small group of very committed investors our friend Dan Martell is one and this group of people just said we're putting $100 million together and we're going to let it ride as long as humanly possible and um so that means we what what what it means for Founders is we buy businesses with the intent of holding them as long as humanly possible I think a lot of private Equity it's like on three and fiveyear time Horizon some even to up to 10 years I'm just trying to figure out what's the motivation for putting together $100 million how did you get raise 100 million what's the promise yeah so the promise was optionality what I don't like about private Equity is you don't have a you buy something and you have to sell it right and so think about funds that started in 2 13 and usually like 7 to 10 years is actually the the term for a private Equity Fund and you spend three or four years just finding the companies you're going to buy and then you've got that's not so say two or three years to find companies then you've got two or three years to grow them and then you really start to you have to start harvesting in that last two or three years so it's a very tight window that you have to actually make an impact and that's when unnatural things start to happen you private Equity firms often will unnaturally strip out expenses and cut deeper than a normal business owner would do they unnaturally throw a whole bunch of debt onto a company that a normal business owner would be worried about right they'd be more conservative um they'll swap out Executives at the drop of a hat if somebody's not working because they've got it they feel like they have to do something um so there's all these unnatural things that happen from the One requirement that they have to sell all these businesses to return Capital so in our model we don't have to sell on any specific timeline so all of those unnatural un I think unhealthy things go out the window and we get to just sit down with the CEOs of our portfolio companies and our investors and my partners and we say what's the right thing for this business right now to make it a good long-term healthy company and so it just changes the the thought process by changing the timeline it's not bound by time it's bound by when do we create a win win win for everyone involved Could Happen 3 years in could happen been 30 years in but we're looking to be a positive force in the financial ecosystem versus however much we can extract yeah just buy flip extract value the other so think about a private Equity Fund that raised money in 2013 let me go back to that example they're in a harvest mode they have to be selling now you guys know now is not Peak multiples are not now and there's a lot of reasons why people would still sell a business now but like all those people wish they would have sold their businesses in 20 and 21 when multiples were bananas right like that figma time period um so we have the ability and it's impossible to like time the market but if it's a down Market we just say okay we're not selling unless we get a really compell compelling offer so we we have optionality that was the essentially the pitch to you know these this group of investors well two two things one I've done this before and it was really successful I was just doing it with uh you know the wrong set of people with the wrong amount of money and the wrong Financial alignment right so I learned lessons from that and I said I know how to do this I know how to find great companies I know how to connect with Founders I know how to create these win-win um transactions where everybody can walk away happy I know how to grow businesses I know how to grow a team I know how to sell businesses if that's something we want to do I know how to raise more money like I've done a lot of this before and it worked and I had relationships with everybody on the cap table I've known for minimum 5 years and uh of the four people and entities on the cap table three had invested in a company I ran before so that I had an unfair Advantage there in terms of raising the money um but the you know the the model was like let's just do the right thing for the business at the right time and we can grow Enterprise Value that's the point not return cash we can return cash but usually the better models use that cash to buy the next business and grow it and then Enterprise Value grows but we have the flexibility and the optionality we can distribute cash if we want to we can take cash from a very profitable business and move it into another business that's growing in needs cash where most most private Equity Funds can't do that um we certainly have the business to sell we have the ability to sell a business if we get a great offer that we shouldn't refuse and we can hold them forever and just let them grow and so that flexibility just means you know we I I feel like as a better model than just like you got one one Playbook buy grow flip if I'm a Founder listening to this podcast great opportunity to to Peak inside the brain of someone who's evaluating hundreds of deals we talked about how important that just the match between the founder and and you at the team I call it like the dog whistle effect what are we trying to attract companies that think and and are built in alignment with our values what else is important so if you're a Founder listening to this podcast and and wondering I wonder if Kevin might buy my business one day help us you know figure out a few more of the drivers of Enterprise Value so for us it's businesso business SAS only so we don't do consumer apps and things like that um we like businesses that are healthy and sustainable so that probably means they weren't grown through Venture Capital money so we love bootstrappers or people that maybe raise a little bit of money but they're growing mainly on the the customer Revenue because that's the more sustainable model we love profitable businesses which call me old school I think businesses were created to make money and software doesn't need to be an exception um and then beyond that we're sort of like industry agnostic you know and all the all the things that everybody else looks at like low churn you know happy customers I'd be wondering as you know someone running a SAS company am am I good or am I not like how good are we from a business that would get Kevin Giddy and excited to say hey i' love to buyer business what turn numbers am are throwing out there what Revenue what profitability like yeah so um I'm going to describe a dream business that I I also love telling Founders like no business is perfect so if your business doesn't look like that does doesn't mean you're doing a bad job it's just the reality what we do is hard and so nobody's ever going to have the per perfect metrics but what we like is businesses that are 2 to 10 million in annual revenue uh so like I don't mind buying businesses that are a little smaller but have the opportunity to grow because we've got the luxury of time and I to own a portfolio of hundreds of SAS businesses and typically that's below the radar of like bigger private Equity firms where 10 million might be their floor so that's kind of strategically and every business that is doing 40 million in Revenue at one point was doing four so that's why we like focusing on that uh that range doesn't mean we couldn't buy business bigger but that's sort of our Target um net negative or net CH net retention over 100% so that means yeah you're going to have some turn but you're going to have more expansion and addition than than contraction so to break that down if you just like stopped selling anything new today the business would still grow based on the the rate of expansion is greater than the rate of turn right I often describe that as the holy Grill of sess like holy Grill yeah exactly so like oh profitable and growing and you know net negative churn yeah like it's these are hard to find and when when they are out there for sale super competitive right so like part of our value is finding things that are they have a good product they've got customers that like it they've got a good team and we can make them better somehow right um and then the other thing for Founders like watching or listening and I'm I didn't invent this but like rule of 40 you know if you add your um growth rate plus your profitability if it's north of 40 awesome and we're actually okay with if if it's all profits and you're flat okay we can probably deal with that you know we got to understand the business why you're flat and do we think we can fix that um and growing 40% and you know not profitable honestly I've got some questions like do you really have to plump every single dollar back into that business if it's growing 40% probably not uh but people have just been wired that way um so that's kind that's kind of I hope that answer your question Johnny that's where a lot of the opportunity is for you though right like if you see those things it's like if I were to read that back it's almost like good product fundamentals good bones of the business but probably some areas where a little bit of consolidation a little bit of efficiency can like start to carve out some margins that the founder might not be capable of carving out on their own yeah they're they they may not be capable they may not know what to do we also can take a dispassionate approach to things right so like and between me and my partners I think we've it's intentional like I I specifically invited them to join me in this company because we we compliment one another so Jason is our coo CFO attention to detail just like just a baller on all those things I I am not an attention to detail guy I'm your typical like Visionary I can tell you what 10 years from now looks like but I kind of get lost in the some of the you know day-to-day stuff uh and Chris is outstanding he leads our acquisition team outstanding at like dealing with Founders breaking down deals figuring out where we spend time where we're Quick Pass uh things like that and um an example I'll give you kind of to your point Matt we were looking at a deal and um great business founder we clicked with um all the metrics looked really cool but like we're we're like Okay can what can we do to make this business better and we started looking at the census of like the the team on the field and what what everybody's doing and they had a a full-time office manager but they've been remote since Co so in a polite way I was kind of like what does this person do and the the founder you know you kind of started like looking at his shoes and didn't really know how to answer he's like she's been with me for 10 years I can't let her go so I just try to keep her busy doing whatever and I'm like all right I I can't do that just so you know and he's like I get it but I'm not going to fire her so it's one of those things by having the dispassionate approach and not like usually we'll take a full team and assume that people are awesome until they prove otherwise but in that case it was just like there's an obvious mismatch match here and you know that's not going to like dramatically change the business but it's just sort of a fresh eyes New Perspective we get the the benefit of Decades of experience running dozens of SAS businesses plus all of our investors and you know uh Network we just sort of have an unfair advantage over your typical founder who isn't in SAS Academy or even if they are like it's you know one human being trying to yeah do everything especially when it's when it's a first time founder like we were talking before he started recording like yeah it's whatever whatever the opposite word of dispassionate is I guess is fully passionate it's that like incredibly emotionally invested over invested yeah and it's just it's it's normal it's part of the gig I've been there we've all been there but it's a it's a different thing like the second owner you know he can do some different stuff with it yeah yeah totally and the the the best kind of F I was talking to um somebody that we all know can't can't say their name um that uh was had knew that like they they they done enough research they know the game and they get that you know they care about where their business lands but they're also aware enough to know they got to be ready to really let it go because the next owner is going to have to make changes and do things that they might not have done or wouldn't know to do and that sort of thing and so that's another thing that um I love kind of back to your one of your first questions like I love when somebody has done a little bit of homework and understands what they're getting into so it's okay if they don't like I take the approach of like let me help people along the way but when somebody's got their dialed in they know exactly what they want they know what their business is worth they don't have unrealistic expectations they kind of know the the the the game that we're getting into the dance that we're going to do together it just makes every it makes everything more fun I we'll to go a lot into like the the founder side of it and what makes a sellable business in a sec but I'd love to fire this question at you um what is a business not so anonymously don't but was there a bus that you looked at that you loved that you ultimately couldn't buy and like what was the deal breaker several yeah several um so in today's SAS Market um and we we talk about this a lot like kind of what is what is the market view because I get I get a different lens on this than than you guys do when there so multiples are are down from peak in like 2021 we all know that there's a ton of capital on the sidelines like waiting to be deployed so when a business pops up and is being represented by a a in a good investment Bank where you see it and all the metrics are awesome you know like it's growing 50% a year and it's profitable and it's modern tech with no like minimal Tech debt and their churn is like you know they've got 10% retention you all these things and it's in a niche that people love like I'm seeing being I can't give you specifics but like just bananas multiples on those sorts of things cuz you've got like big time PE firms competing with one another you probably got strategics at the table and they just drive up an auction and there's a lot of business i' I've looked at five in the last two months that I would love to own we just don't invest that much time because we're not going to overpay we don't have to we've got we can be patient um help us understand relatively what were the multiples in 2021 what are you seeing as average now and then what are these like wild numbers one of one of those somebody paid 16 times Revenue we don't know who bought it I don't know if it was a it could be a big PE firm doing an add-on so that kind of feels like a strategic could have been a strategic in the space and it's in a space that um is just inherently sticky you know there's some industries that they just don't switch out software because they move slow and you guys can use well I I won't I won't divulge anything about the the company but I can tell you like healthcare is notorious for having very sticky software product they move slow tough to slow tough to sell hard to rip out uh government same thing like they move slow they're not good they're not they they don't buy often so when they do they let it sit and they don't so um you know there a couple other sectors like that Tech like that kind of stuff yeah um so it was in one of those notorious like sticky things um and somebody paid 16 times Revenue which is like that's kind of back to the bananas days of 2021 now I would say and this not just my perspective but I think you know industry perspective I talked to a um we're not raising money but I talked to somebody who was interested in big band just learning a story and her job is to allocate Capital into different type of Investments and she's like I I hate when I hear private Equity firms say they pay five to seven times Revenue because it's hard to actually make your money back and you just have to count on there being a next dummy Upstream that's willing to pay that that multiple or more yeah and so I would say what is normal for a financial buyer is more in the two to four times Revenue you know maybe up to five for really nice business strategics it might be five to seven um but it all depends right so like it's hard to it's I think it's just helpful to get a as a Founder if you're not running the back in an apkin math and in fact this is a great uh segue into you teach a framework called annual exit planning so if you're as a Founder you're not sitting down one time per year thinking about what's the business what would be a dream exit for me what would be a dream buyer what's my criteria it's entirely possible to wake up in a business that you don't enjoy running and or build a business that becomes very hard to exit one day so be building with the end in mind is a principle I know that you are uh you know you teach quite frequently it's core to what we do at SAS Academy I mean the first coaching call we sit down with the founder we ask him what's the exit look like and this doesn't mean we call it a perfect desit because it doesn't always mean the sale of the business but we do need to know what we're building it for like what do you value do you want to pull as much cash out of the business as possible work one day a week and hang out fishing all day you want to sell this thing do you have more businesses in you that you want to go on and build like getting really clear on what we are trying to build for super important so walk us through for a Founder that needs you know wants to sit down and work through that exercise how what do you uh build into an annual Exit Plan if you're trying to be ready for the other thing I'll just give context is it's wild to me how frequently I think there's probably 10 to 20 Founders that exit their companies through uh in the Sass Academy ecosystem every year almost all of them it happened way sooner than they thought it was going to so be ready be ready for the call when it comes right narrator I was not ready true to the promise at the beginning of the podcast this is a information I know that you and I would have loved to had when we started the process of selling our companies Kevin walk us through what should a Founder be thinking through on an annual basis to make sure that they get their dream outcome yeah so I I put it all online because I uh I kind of got sick of having the same conversation with Founders to be candid um where people call they find me whether they want they're ready to sell their business or they got a letter of intent they don't know what to do and I try to coach people whether I'm a potential buyer or not and I kept hearing the same questions over and over and I kept seeing 99 out of 100 Founders clearly not ready and so I just tried to write down and I iterate on this um annual exit planning.com and there's a workbook that you can download there but I'll walk you through some of the things that I put in there that I think are important that most a lot of people don't talk about so first of all the fact that it should be an an annual exercise nobody says like best advice on the Internet or in the real world is from like you know investment bankers or brokers who will help you sell a business their best advice is start preparing two or three years before you think you want to sell but you just point it out like you don't know when that time comes where you're going to get a letter and you have to respond right so that's crap advice and we do annual strategic planning all of us in our businesses every year right and every quarter you revisit it so like the exit is the thing even even if your your your perfect exit as you put it is like Harvest cash and be on a beach because somebody else is running my business well that requires planning and like if that's your end goal why aren't you focused on that annually even more than you're focused on your annual strategic planning so annual is the first thing that I think is important and to illustrate the fact that nobody else is talking about that I got annual exit planning.com for like $6.99 on GoDaddy right and all the domain squatters everybody in the world nobody thought to put put those three words together um so more to the point of like what's in it and this may seem non-consensus like the fact that I want to like a Founder before I buy their business first question is are you happy scale 1 to 10 like looking back over the last six months are you actually happy running their bu your business and I think a lot of us don't ask that question and we're not honest with ourselves about that question because people get tied up and I don't think it's just first-time Founders but I think it's it's it's more acute with first-time founders it becomes our identity and it doesn't matter whether I'm happy or not this is who I am this is what I do this is how I feed my family I can't quit I can't sell it that's giving up you know we have a lot of I say the collective we I've talked to thousands of Founders so I'm speaking on their behalf and our mine we get way too wrapped up in the emotion of running a business and I just encourage people to hit pause minimum once a year and just say is this what I want to keep doing you know I think it's a super important question to ask and and part of it is counting the cost of what's it going to take to get to the next level in the business we love that business is such an effective tool for personal development but it really puts a lot of stress on the founder to go through that personal evolution of every stage of the business we just had clay Mass the founder of keep and infusion soft that are our most recent intensive and he's a CEO has live through the Journey from zero to 100 million and he talks about the ones and three of building a business go to 100K to 300K 300K to million million all the way up it's very rare for team members to go through two of those uh levels intact the founder has to be the one to go through all of them or or they don't they don't have to right another guy Jason Cohen was at another one of the Sass Academy he stepped out of being a founder and just took a different role at his own company and people thought he was bananas smartest move ever right so like I think there is this the reason I stopped you is like people think the founder has to evolve and be the one to lead the business forever it's just not true yeah it's part of counting the cost the reason why asking yourself am I happy doing this is because the game you have to play to run a $10 million company versus a 30 million versus the $1 million completely different it's just entirely possible that you might be a great founder for one to three million or for 3 to 10 million and that there are other operators that are there's Z genius is at the the 10 to 40 and you can optimize for your happiness and overall uh satisfaction in life by considering what do I love about building this business at some point it goes from pioneering the product into operating a team and you might not like what that next phase has so first question is are you happy what's the second thing you encourage someone to go through when they're doing their annual Exit Plan second question in the workbook I think is what what's what's the end I call it the end game you call it the perfect exit I think end game is more because it doesn't have to be an exit right and um super simple I try to just break it down is it about time or is it about money so some people say I want to sell this thing and get $10 million and I also point out to people like money in your bank account not the price on the contract because those are two very different numbers you've got a whole bunch of transaction fees you got to pay Sam in America um so like is the money in your bank account is what you should be thinking about as your target or I I think I can do this for another five years and then I'm out for whatever reason just making that up right um another really important part that runs throughout the annual exit planning process is if you have a co-founder it is important I encourage people do it do this exercise separately and then come back and compare answers because in my experience your answers are not going to be the same hopefully they're close and then you can kind of so like if if you and I are Partners in a business Johnny and you want to run it for the next 20 years and I'm like I got five more bro and I'm out yeah that's okay you can solve for that but you want to plan for that right and you don't want to find out yeah you don't want to find out four years from now that I'm like all right Johnny I want to sell this business next year and you're like whoa right but people don't I mean healthy good Founders probably are talking about that but I think it's good to like sit down think about it go through the process once a year come back together and if you're not close together that's your homework that's something you got to figure out how how are we going to deal with this issue or who do we have to talk to to pull into this circle to help us deal with this issue so really I mean there there's when people download the workbook there's nothing magic or special I just tried to take like simple questions to help people think and there's also stuff about like what are your metrics and who's in your team and do you have the right advisors and this sort of thing but it's a lot of like just Basics that nobody really I try to just make it simple for Founders because like I said I talked to so many and like it's and it's it's it's not that they're doing the wrong things if you're the founder of a software business or any business you should be laser focused on the health and growth of that business MH and what I do all day the word software are connected is a completely different thing than running I mean we run software companies but the buying and selling of businesses is a completely different game and Founders think well I'm ready to sell my business so they don't even know that they're going into a different game so I'm just trying to give people a a little bit of an insight into that to help people think know what other questions to ask know what other research to do like the end of the the annual exit planning workbook is okay now we go back back through all the sections and now you got homework because each one will probably expose gaps if you've got a co-founder and you're not on the same page sort that out if you've we've got a list of here's all the advisers you're going to need or service providers you're going to need to help sell a business write down not not oh I think I know a lawyer write down the name and if you don't know a name and an email that's a gap so go fill that Gap that doesn't mean you have to go put somebody on retainer go talk to a couple attorneys and feel figure out who you like and are they the right attorney for this particular thing so that when you do get that call and expectedly Matt you've got your speed dial all set up and you know who to who to call instead of scrambling and asking your friends who should I call for a lawyer hopefully you built up a relationship with these people so important so important if you're a Founder don't don't kick that can down the road go right down those names you do not want to be at looking for a lawyer when you need one you have you lower the bar on quality and you just are searching for availability at that point and it's way too important your life's work is wrapped up into this thing don't leave it up to chance one of my favorite questions that you ask in there is you unpack what would the dream buyer look like and I think that that's really effective and I love for you to unpack more about it can you unpack like walking through the exercise of the dream buyer what should a Founder be thinking about so they can have that filter and only entertain the the the conversations that fit that yeah so kind of going back to like just in the simplest term strategic and financial buyers right so strategic it's the it's a it's a bigger company than mine that does something like me that I don't hate right if it's a competitor that you just despise it's not going to feel good to sell to that company even if they give you a big number and so I help people unpack that like it's not just about the number it's about like what happens to your business what is your role if any in the next ownership what happens to your team and I'm not judgmental about any if you don't care what happens to your team that's fine but like know that because that's part of the filtering criteria um so if there are strategic buyers that you know would be a good fit and you know you want to sell to let's make sure we write those down so if they email you inbound you jump on that you respond and if they're not emailing you you email you find somebody in that building that has some sort of juice that you can build a relationship with and convince them that it's a good thing to buy your company and this is a long game play here right you're not going to have one meeting and they say hey good idea we should buy your company right timing is so important in this thing timing is important having relationships is important and just knowing the players and who the decision makers are at a larger company is is important to do and so if you don't have that relationship you don't know the people like get to work like that an exit's important to you well like that's that's your job as the founder and CEO to like engineer your perfect exit right um and then on the the financial buyer side I try to just help people understand the differences between private equity and a holding company and search funds which I I talked about but we didn't come back to briefly that's somebody that um doesn't have money but people have told them we'll maybe give you money if you come to us with a deal that everybody likes and so they pop up a website that makes them look like a private Equity Firm and they just start like basically cold emailing Founders and say I'd love to buy your business and it's fine to sell to those people but you just got to know what you're getting into right like they might write you an offer and they don't have the cash in the in the in the bank right so that's something to be aware of and it you know just like there's different questions to ask these different groups right if you're approached by Vista Equity Partners one of the biggest and best software private Equity firms in the world you don't ask them if they have money as a as a silly example they've got piles of money but if it's some other group that you've never heard of that doesn't have vista's expectation it is perfectly okay to say how much money do you have is it committed do you have it in the bank or are you raising from investors and who are these investors I want to know who they are where's the experience on this team um and so you know back to the the dream buyer formula I try to just kind of lay out these different things that most Founders don't think about or if they think about it they don't know what I know of the world and give people some kind of guidance on finding that win-win situation I also coach people to put themselves in the buyer shoes because you know win-win means both parties got to win and if you're just there to extract as as much money as possible from the buyer with you know every term benefits you and not them and you know you're winning so I lose that's you're probably not going to get a deal done because a a a good experienced buyer is going to walk away from that and you're probably going to damage something in the process even if you get a yeah I think that's really important like one of the things that I've coached Founders on when they've been approaching this point in their in their career especially after they it's like it's like two things when they get the key terms and the letter intent and then when they get the first version of the purchase agreement and like they they end up with this big laundry list egged on by their lawyers about all the different things that they don't like which is fine and good and part of the process but one of the things I always tell them is take that list of everything and do two things stack rank it of importance to you top to bottom and then highlight the ones that are deal breakers meaning I would walk away from the table if I can't fix this and be prepared to negotiate bottom up on all the rest because you can't just put your flag in the ground and say Kevin you got to change 47 things or no deal because you just end up with no deal right right like you've got to know what you can Flex on because you're right it's got to be a win for both sides totally and this is where having the right attorney is also important and a good relationship with that attorney because you know any founder listening probably has an attorney that they can call to like look at a contract or you know get me out of this employee situation what that's not who you call in this situation most most times you want somebody whose job it is all day every day to get deals done they look at these contracts they know all the ins and out they know what is they would say like what's market like what's normal to be asked for on both sides and if you've got two attorneys that both do that for a living you could probably get to a good answer quickly and the other thing that's important about having the right relationship with that attorney is knowing when to tell the attorney sit down I got this and you need them for all the legal advice and explain to you the ins and outs and where the risk is but at the end of the day the business people have to say we've agreed on the important stuff and you need to stop arguing about stuff that's not important cuz lawyers were all will argue all day every day if you let them and eventually you got to say like look and I I love your your model like this is number 37 on the list why are we arguing about this like just give them that and yeah give them that so we can get these three things and that's sort of the um part of that The Art of Doing deals is knowing when to push knowing when to back off and what's important to all parties and understanding the other side isn't going to show you their list but you know they have it right if you're a seller if you're a Founder you know the buyers got their their stack rank list of like deal breakers and I love the bottom up you I just you know I love the way you frame that Matt so the more you can understand about their list and and sort of match it with your even if you're not actually being transparent about it um I love to ask Founders like what's important to you yeah not at the deal not that the like first conversation we there there's a half a chance that we might buy your business like what's important to you in this transaction and it could be you know keep the team could be take care of my customers could be don't f with my brand because I love it it could be I don't care about any of those things I want Max dollars and like there's no wrong answer but just understanding what they care about then we know to kind of match up what do we care about and you know find that alignment yeah I tell you just real quick on the on the lawyer thing cuz I like to your guys' point I wish I had that advice and figure out who your lawyer was I was lucky like Dan was able to introduce me to someone who had a partner who had done a bunch of transactions so like I lucked out um but she was incredible and one of the she told me a couple of things so a it was an interesting experience because she usually would did buy side representation so she was able to tell me everything they were going to say before they said it she was uncanny and how accurate she was which was cool but um to your point on what you said she told me up front she said look if you left this up to the lawyers the deals would never get done my job is to make you understand the worst possible outcome and risk of every single point in this and then your job is to tell me which one of those things you care about that's how this relationship should work she sounds awesome yeah she was great so like if you're listening to this and you're like how do I work with a lawyer that is how you work with a lawyer and it was great and she took me right up until my like level of Tolerance on how much I could look at all these little bullet point stuff and I was like I have what I need here like let's just get this done yeah you know when then you get into like that that's a she sounds amazing our our guy is Joe and like there will be times where we're we're negotiating finer points and I'm like Joe we're trying to get a deal done we're trying to get it done next Friday yeah okay those are your instructions we've handled the big stuff there's a there's a small stuff that is not important and he knows he knows that conversation like got it I will solve this problem and you know then he can work with the other lawyer to get it get it handled uh another point in annual exit planning is like everybody knows you need a lawyer because you're going to have to read a contract uh you probably going to want your accountant on board or your financial planner on board to understand what ends up in your checking account based on the the big number um having somebody an adviser or a peer mentor like that's where the SAS Academy Community is amazing because you have other people who maybe gone through this before because a lawyer's job good ones will step in and be the psychologist when you're pushed to the edge of your you know ability to tolerate something crushing you right and that's not really their job and that may not be what they're good at so having somebody is out of the process not you know getting paid or maybe you do pay them right but like they're they're they have a different role right so I also en encourage people like get a peer mentor group if you're not already in ass sass Academy or whatever you know have other people like build a relationship with somebody who sold a business before you need that relationship because you can learn from them and what worked and what didn't and so it's actually you know it's one of those takes a village to raise a child people don't think about those things until the last minute and then you're Panic calling whoever you know to try to get get the right relationships I got to got to give you some Kudos man we recently did a a perfect exit interview for a client of ours that went on to exit to a strategic and they said hey if I hadn't been in SAS Academy and gone through the annual exit planning we wouldn't have been ready because they had a competitor in the space that was at a Crossroads they said hey we're either going to build this feature or we're going to buy it and and they had a three to six week window where they were evaluating which which way is faster these guys got the phone call they knew they wanted to answer it because it was in their dream buyer list and they go on to exit for a a multiple they thought they took count of what's it going to look like for us to keep on pushing the business forward that they're both full-time doctors and built this great product on the side and they were like look we're not the guys to take it to that next level and so it it pays off tremendously to sit down and think about what do we want to what what are we building the business for what parts of this do we like what do we not like what would a dream buyer look like but it's very hard to anticipate what it's going to feel like especially if it's your first exit when you when this starts to happen when it snowballs you get that letter of intent you go into due diligence and the the end of the tunnel is getting closer and closer the emotions around this massive change in your life really will can sometimes derail it so you this in many ways for you is a sale you are closing what are some of the objections that come up for you when you're dealing with Founders kind of getting them to that finish line that um I think it's good to have the label on the bottle if you founder listening to this things one day you made it this far on the podcast you think an exit somewhere help help put a little bit of uh the label on the bottle for what to expect generally it's just really really stressful um and and it doesn't doesn't have to be big numbers it's it's a stressful thing you know you and we've already hit on F founder psychology of being overly emotionally invested in your business right and so to use the kid analogy you know um it's like sending a kid off to college or like I don't know if they're little sending them to overnight camp for the first time or whatever and actually there there was a study uh woman named Dr Sher Walling told me about this study and I'm going to butcher it so sorry Sherry if you ever see this but she didn't do it but she told me about where uh and I'll come back to your question but um psychologists were showing business owners pictures of their kids and then they'd sprinkle in random images that had nothing to do with their family kids and then random and just you know measuring their brain in real time of like how the brain was responding and then they started peppering in business images their logo their business name the building their businesses in the brain reacts exactly the same our businesses give us the same reaction as our children it's kind of effed up actually if you think about it but it that it's you're getting betrayed by your psychology because no one would ever say that their business is more important than their children but no but it's equal if not at times can be a black hole to be even more of an investment into your business than you do into your your kids 100% yeah it's there's so we can get into well it's like your kids kids can be complic ated and they've got friends and they've got school whatever business is you probably infinitely more complicated because everybody working in the business is also a human being that has all that stuff going on and all the relationships and so it is you know I've I've you'll continue to raise four kids and I've built a couple of businesses like it's a different kind of hard but the emotional investment required to do it is high on both levels right so the reason I bring that up is just to illustrate to people it's not weird if you're freaking out cuz it's a stressful situation um I try to use my powers only for good and my Powers being like I've done this you know 50 times if you as you pointed out and to close 50 deals I've talked to thousands of Founders and the conversations are very everyone's different but there Al there's a lot of commonality and stress at time of exit is always there and the closer you get to the exit the more the stress builds um and any like legal hiccup or we need this document and I can't find it or what um if you've got a spouse or a family and people are you know they want an update what happened today and like you know that that adds to the stress right and so when I say use my powers only for good it's like I I understand that and I if Founders aren't aware of that or ready for it I try to coach them like this is going to get stressful but our job is to keep the stress as low as possible cuz we've done this before and you haven't done this as much as we have um and part of the annual exit planning and all the coaching I do with SAS Academy and anybody else is just try to lower that stress right so if you go and it's cool that this this group said they benefited from my coaching that like makes my heart smile but um if you go through the the process and it's not perfect but it will give you some things to think about and some homework to do to help you get more ready which hopefully makes you less stressed out right like if you if you know the rules of the game that you're about to play you're less stressed out if you got the right team around you to help you you're going to be less stressed out if you're on the same page with your co-founder if you have one and you've got the you know you're marching towards the same goal you're going to be less stressed out if you just kind of study this and think about it every once in a while it's not like you pivot away from being focused on your company but like read a newsletter every once in a while build a relationship with an investment banker who can tell you what how things go you know listen to a podcast with Kevin every once in a while and just kind of start to think about those the rules of that game hopefully the stress it's not going to go away but hopefully the stress comes down a little bit you I think Matt and I get that get to be front row Center you do too of of many of these Founders going through this first time Financial it's a huge has huge financial implications they get to wrestle with what what do they love and enjoy about business the first time they get some optionality a lot of times you start building the business for the first time because it's the best way for you to put you know food on the table for your family and uh now you get to wrestle with like what do I really want to do and so a lot of psychology and emotions wrapped up into it um but an extremely rewarding one so I think you made a great point you get around some people that have done this thing before and um find out what were the uh the wins and the the losses the the Lessons Learned along the way mean can I add one thing like don't just listen to podcasts and then you guys have you told me about a couple I don't want to spoil like awesome Founders who had exits and they tell the story um people tell the best version of the story usually on a on a in a public setting whether it's a podcast or at a conference building real relationships with people and sitting down with them in person because you can You' be like what really happened yeah tell me about the pain in going through the process what what would you what would you do differently or like help help help me avoid something you know those conversations are way more valuable than just listening to you know the built to sell podcast or how I built this you just can't say in a public for you know mean or you don't want to right like you sold your business and you've got this like hero complex for a little while and you know even the most honest people on podcast aren't really giving you the full story cuz cuz cuz they can't or or they don't want to or there's something that is uncomfortable so to give context we are on the eighth floor in downtown Denver overlooking kersfield for a mastermind event and one of our our speakers at this event is ass sass Academy alumni who has got several very exciting exits on his belt and then he's also got some where there's some Scar Tissue on decisions he wish he would have done differently and cool thing is he shares very openly about it but we asked him to come because it's very easy to get the Highlight Reel of the exits but it's super important for the people still building today to hear about how can it deal go south you know at best you get even the most serial entrepreneur gets five or six app BS of this and a year unless you're doing what you're doing where you're you know this is your entire world but if your core competency is building SAS companies you might be at this intersection once or twice in your life one is puts you in the top 1% and if you've built two businesses you're in the top 0 one% I I don't I may call me um call me negative but I don't think people should go into their life thinking I'm going to build four or five businesses and have them all work out it's just it's so rare hey before we move on from this topic and I know this may not pertain as directly to big band but I think we would be doing Founders listening a disservice if we don't hit on it is like statistically you're most likely to exit to private Equity right I think there's most likely to be some type of post exit involvement some type of earnout and expectation for you to stick around and for many Founders it might be the first time that they've gone to your point from 25 to 250 or in my case from 12 to 700 person company and trying to figure out what life is like and it I queued into this when you were talking about like Equity rollovers and and stuff like that and and Kevin I think you're a great person just to explain this I think there are a lot of people that don't necessarily understand like how do earn outs work what are the different components of a deal you know cash versus stock upfront versus stock that's vesting versus you know earn outs on future performance like what what are the different types of compensation that a Founder should look out for and expect to have to deal with and like how do you hand them differently yeah um that's a great question and so we could do a whole episode on this so let me hit the high points and you tell me if you want to dig into it so um most so and this is one of the downsides of selling shouldn't be judgmental one of the realities of selling to a strategic is often you're going to get stock in the in the other company which can be great if their stock prices going like this but that never happens forever and you're out of it it's not in your control um and so and and stock you can't buy a car with stock you can't buy a boat with stock um so that's just something to look out for in a strategic um exit I think you know basically cash I would add hold back into the the grouping that you talked about and earn out um and we never deal in stocks and it's like every Situation's different I would just say like if any of your compensation deals and stock like actually really smart good friend of mine was like if anybody offered me stock for my company I would say you give me the cash and I'll decide if your stock is the one I want to buy right and and even if it's a private company like they can make that happen but then you're giving me the power and I get to underwrite you but if you're not making an option then I I would prefer the cash and that may not that may just not be possible but it's like I would push back on stock almost always uh even if it was like stock in Google right because you can you're putting a lot of eggs into one basket that you don't control after controlling all of your company so then then let's go simpler like cash is cash right cash at close um seller notes is another thing that people need to understand right so that might be okay I'm going to buy your business for $20 million I'm going to give you $10 million at close um I and I'm going to give you the other 10 million ion spread over a whatever fouryear period uh and that may or may not have interest tied to it but basically as the seller you're saying I'm going to take half the cash or whatever percentage and basically I'm I'm giving a loan to the company that the company's going to pay out over time that adds complexity you might end up getting a little bit more if there's interest tied to that seller note but it's just delayed gratification and sellers got to decide do you want all the cash up front or do you want do you want that um because there is some risk inherent in that um a hold back would be I'm going to give so the same $20 million deal I'm going to give you $15 million now and the other five is just based on a period of time and you living up to some obligation usually so let's say we're going to transition the business to a new CEO that we're putting in place which we will often do but we need the founder to help for six months like we don't ask people to stick around for two years because I think that is not necessary because we can hire op operators and often it actually isn't good for the business if cuz the founder you just gave me a pile of money I'm checked out I'm going to question all the decisions you're making CEO might you know like your team might be trying to go around the CEO to you if they don't agree with so it just can create some messiness and I have found if you can't get your arms around a business six months like you're doing something wrong about the wrong business or you're the wrong right right but but like okay founder just to make sure you don't just buy a boat and check out we're going to hold back some of the money and just give you the last bit of money after six months is our kind of standard but it's not tied to business performance so that's the difference between a hold back and an earnout an earnout would be and typically an earnout would be employed if I think your business is worth $20 million you think it's worth $25 million because it's growing or you've got this new partner you just signed up or you've got a new channel you're about to you know uh exploit whatever and and this isn't just our our approach is like General approach like all we'll prove it yeah you know you're you're trying to sell me on a future that's going to happen typically a a buyer would want the founder to help make that future a reality and say okay well if the business Grows by X you know X revenue or Y profit then you get that extra $5 million but you got to earn it now some tricky things to think about there and this is where you need a good deal attorney to help you navigate all this stuff but um actually go my that that same guy meritz that I talked about from the earlier story we both I was like I want to buy your second business you want to sell it to me but he knew it was like he's like I could just wait a year and you're still going to want to buy it and I'm still so like what what is it going to take for for the deal to happen now instead of in a year or two years or whatever and we just structured a deal to where as long as it kept growing and hitting Milestones he just got a couple extra checks but he was smart and he's like you know he knew we were focused on profitable growth and we figured out I think it was just based on Revenue right so even if we overspent on the business uh as long as the revenue hit CU that's very easy to count and it's in everybody's control like he was helping he could help grow the business why wouldn't we help grow the business um but if if it's on like profitability that's a red flag because now you're you're the founder you no longer have control if somebody is you know squeezing margins or whatever then you're going to have trouble hitting your earnout and it's still possible but you got to put a whole lot of rules around like how are we counting the money what are you obligated to do and meritz again he was smart he's like what if you don't invest to help me grow so we created some simple structure of like you know at this point we'll add a team member we'll always invest X on like paid ads or whatever so we got to the right place and we got to that place because we had built trust we knew each other and he just wanted some guard rails that probably his attorney coached him on but um that's sort of like and there's again infinite complexity but does that answer your question Matt yeah yeah yeah for sure because it's like I think that what my experience at least in Walking Founders through this who've done it for the first time is is many of them will learn about an earnout when they receive a letter of intent and they'll say I have a $30 million deal value but 15 million of it is on this earnout but like looks good that'll probably happen like I feel pretty good about it I'm like okay let's just talk about the 17 different questions that I think you need to ask this acquirer to figure it out right like you hit on many of them I think there's there's one that always comes up for me is is the earnout contingent on your participation or just on the results of the business you they buying you know cuz that's that's like a huge life Direction you know Cher for the founder so yeah I think it answers the question I just I would love for this dialogue to build awareness with founders of saying when I receive a deal there's likely going to be some money up front some of it might be stock they might keep some of it back and then to bridge a gap in what they think it's worth and what I think it's worth they're probably going to pitch me on this earnout and statistically there's a very good chance that I might not see that earnout money so I need to negotiate accordingly so I just that's what the awareness I'm trying to build here yeah like the conventional wisdom is like earn outs never pay out I've always anytime we structured one we we usually structure it so that it's achievable and I I love writing that second check because that means we did together what we wanted to do um so that's not that's not my experience but apparently it's true like people just try to screw owners on or sellers on earn outs um so I get people like when we when we are trying to close a valuation Gap and we put earnout in Founders immediately like ah nobody ever pays earnout I'm like well that we do like we that that's the plan but um got a good track record to prove you've done though also which is cool yeah I mean I think the biggest red flag is on the stock like the earnout if it was a rank or to them really double click on the rollover double click on both and all of it if you take one thing out of this like these are very high potential super exciting times but also not ones you want to mess up so surround yourself with great you know mentorship and resources to help navigate this um which I think is a is a great place to to land the plane here Kevin one of the things I love about working with you is for the 50 or so that you've bought and the thousands that you've evaluated there's thousands more that you've coached and mentored through the process and you do it willingly it's a it's a there what you put out into to the world so if someone's looking to get that support we'll make sure we drop the links in the show notes of how to get a hold of you you come to all of our events um so if you're in SAS Academy it's
