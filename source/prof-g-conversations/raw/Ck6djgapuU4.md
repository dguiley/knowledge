we know that the ocean has absorbed about a third of the carbon dioxide that's been emitted by burning fossil fuels and that's made the ocean explain how that happens like what is it in the ocean it's just this chemical reaction on the surface I heard I thought it was the Krill or whale poop or something there no oh that's the there's a broader carbon cycle in the ocean there's a like half of the you know some estimates are that about half of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean [Music] Dr Johnson where does this podcast find you I am in Brooklyn New York in a hotel room it's the first thing I'm doing on publication day of yeah what if we get it right nice so let's let's bust right into it in your new book what if we get it right visions of climate Futures uh you provide a curated collection of in-depth interviews with experts and earth science technology AI design and agriculture as well as activists and journalists to Showcase a variety of climate Solutions and to help people Envision a more hopeful future so what how would you describe let's go right to the title of your book how would you describe getting it right what does right look like to you right looks like actually quickly deploying all the climate Solutions we already have so we already know how to transition to renewable energy we already know how to do better public transit and green buildings and Energy Efficiency and better farming and protecting and restoring ecosystems like there's not a big mystery to how to address the climate crisis there's not a thing where we need to wait for some magical technology to come along I think that's the the sort of blessing of this moment is that we basically have the solutions we need it's just a matter of how quickly and how justly we can Implement them so obviously there's a we have an arsenal of weapons at our disposal to try and address this but if if you were to stack rank them and say all right these are the most obvious things that would have the greatest Roi so to speak what would those two or three things be I think it depends on what on What level you're asking that question right because if you're asking this for the listener who wants to do something today that's very different from the broader sort of Social and cultural shifts that need to happen apart from democracy right we have a huge challenge with the culture of consumerism in this country which is holding us back in a lot of different ways also not a quick fix but something we each have a lot more control over but one thing that people don't really know is how powerful their money is not only in the sense of the importance of voting with your dollars every day in every purchase but thinking about where your savings are where your retirement Investments are because there was a study a few years ago that came out by Bank forward and some other organizations saying that if you have say $125,000 saved for your retirement that money if it's not invested in a fossil fuel free fund could be doing more harm in terms of contributing to carbon emissions through the expansion of oil and gas infrastructure then all the good you could possibly do just like walking and biking everywhere eating only plants Etc and that was very shocking for me to learn that it really really matters to find a um a climate friendly place to keep our money because we have in the US the four biggest banks City Bank JP Morgan um Wells Fargo and Bank of America that are have collectively funded trillions of dollars towards the fossil fuel industry since the US signed the Paris agreement saying we were committing to wind down and so are those Industries in the US are growing when we actually need to be making this transition so that personal shift is actually the the easiest sort of like in one day what one person with money in the bank can do the biggest difference let me just start off with a common ground I I believe the climate change is an existential crisis I'm worried about it I think every parent that has kids are a concern for the future you know this is a four five car alarm whatever the term is we need to get on this where I would push back is uh so consumerism out of control consumerism and the basic notion that we just need to be more thoughtful about how much we consume uh I think that's a I think it's a really solid argument I see no evidence that's going to happen has happened or will happen uh every generation we assume that they're more noble than us more concerned about the Earth and there's some sign they're more socially aware but generally speaking as the economy becomes more productive people take advantage of it and want to consume more for less and I don't I don't see evidence of that and I feel like it's pushing a rock up a hill I would also argue that asking consumers to invest in something that um when you when you limit the universe of your potential investment options you just naturally as a function of math reduce the ROI and it feels like there's such politicized push back on these efforts that I I I worry that these two things aren't going to be effective that that they actually aren't realistic in terms of asking people to lower the ROI on their Investments or reduce their consumerism your thoughts so I think you know there's a very very long list of things individuals corporations governments Etc can do I guess my question to you is if we're not willing to change anything about our Behavior that's significant why would we expect the five alarm fire to go out that's a fair point well I'll give an opinion I think we need to appeal to people's greed glance that there's huge opportunity here for new technologies there's huge opportunity to invest in Renewables that uh nuclear is a fantastic in my view I don't know how you feel about it I I'll use this as a question but nuclear energy uh presents an enormous opportunity for both not only climate change but just a more efficient way of producing power I'm just so disappointed that this whole conversation has been politicized and I'm trying to figure out a way to make arguments that appeal to both sides of the aisle such that we have an easier time getting stuff done but I don't well I think the thing with new nuar is that's also not a quick fix right it takes a decade at least to develop a nuclear plant to get it permitted and built right so we're talking about a scenario where we need to get our emissions cut by half this decade so nuclear um is already part of our Energy Mix may continue to be part of our Energy Mix um but that alone is not enough to get us there right we don't have Fusion yet and so I think you know one of the things that I found really exciting is we have now because Congress passed the inflation reduction act the um infrastructure um and jobs act all this funding going to changing the way we build and do things in the US we have all these for example battery manufacturing plants going up primarily in red states with great green jobs we have Iowa and Texas as the largest producers of wind energy in the United States that's not because they're hippies right and you know I think modernizing the grid is very important we can't even bring all of this renewable energy into the mix in some places right because our grid is so Antiquated um and so I mean if that's political then I guess that's political but like we're going to have to make some significant changes to the way we use energy the way we go food the way we get around in order to have these uh reductions and carbon pollution that we need to see and of course there's an economic argument to be made for this I mean people are making a lot of money off of this transition and last year marked the first year that the major Banks actually invested more in Renewables than fossil fuels was still in the US over a trillion dollars on each um so not as big a difference as we'd like to see but when you're talking about sort of like what individuals can do it's certainly not build a nuclear PL in their backyard right and so I think to answer your question of what we can do like it really matters the scale right there's political change that needs to happen because corporations aren't all volunteering to do the right thing there needs to be some bar set umw they're not good enough right and they're not enforced often we had under the Trump Administration the roll back of over a hundred environmental regulations for clean air and clean water Etc so setting a minimum standard of Environmental quality is something that's you know the Clean Water Act the Clean Air Act Endangered Species Act um they were all signed under Reagan in the 70s with bipartisan support so the politicization of Environmental Conservation and climate in particular is actually quite new in US history and I would like like a short-term time machine to just go back not even that far I mean I think a lot of people who are close to Nature whether they're Farmers or hunters or hikers know that things are changing in the wrong direction and want to be a part of fixing that like Ducks Unlimited trout unlimited like these folks are active conservationists right because they know that their Hobbies their passions require healthy ecosystems so I personally don't think any of this has to be political like we all actually want a good future for children and there's polling that shows that the biggest motivator for people to act on climate is love for future Generations it's actually not profit which I found to be surprising it's not any number of other things it really is like I want to leave a better world for my children and the biggest thing that could convince conservative men to care more about climate change is their daughters saying you're setting our future on fire and I'm scared and that sort of instinct to protect our daughters our children kicks in in this way that's actually beneficial for the planet so there's a lot of certainly like psychology and economics uh and politics and policy Etc and culture all at play here what if we said okay we're going to stop subsidizing the beef industry and we're going to do what a lot of Western nation's done recognizing that fossil fuels you know are are bad for us over the long term there's been an incredible economic Arbitrage but there's real extra here and we put a you know a $5 a gallon tax on gasoline in the US and we started we stopped subsidizing all the water and things that create beef unnaturally inexpensive what what about just straight economic pricing to address or to foot to the externalities that would absolutely help I mean getting just eliminating the subsidies would be a great start the US still subsidized its fossil fuel corporations to the tune of millions of dollars a day um I could think of better things to spend that money on right it has never been a Level Playing Field for clean energy in this country um and so the fact that clean energy is growing as fast as it is is sort of a miracle and proof that just catching photons from the sky is much more efficient with a piece of glass pointed at the Sun than Drilling and fracking and all this other stuff um and and so I think you know this is this energy transition is going to happen regardless it is much more efficient it is more profitable it's just a matter of how fast how long that takes um and this really is a race against the clock what do you think of the idea of trying to wealthier Nations trying to bind together and figuring out a way to either subsidize or encourage developing nations who look at us and say okay you've enjoyed this great fossil fuel Arbitrage as people become wealthier as Nation becomes Nations become wealthier they kind of engage in things that quite frankly just create a lot of emissions and when we say don't make them the same mistake we did they say well okay easy for you to say you're already wealthy what role do we have or is there a role or is it do you think it's feasible for us to bind together wealthy Nations and trying and figure out I don't know if it's direct economic subsidies to say all right please don't go down the route of coal please don't go down the root of beef what what role do we have and does this exist this exists through the United Nations um intergovernmental panel on climate change at the last um Conference of the parties annual climate conference um countries agreed to establish what they called a loss and damage fund to help countries deal with the impacts of climate change you're talking more about um you know the reducing emission side but there's also the like ooh like these rich countries caused this problem and it's largely the these less wealthy less developed countries that are bearing the brunt of it because it's hitting so hard in the tropics right with um hurricanes and floods and droughts and like insane heat waves temperatures like 130 plus degrees that just humans are not built to withstand and so that fund has been set up but wealthy countries just are not making the contributions that um they promised that people expected and then there's a question of course of how to best distribute that because there will never be enough funds for all the need that there is um but what you're talking about sort of jumping you know away from coal to Renewables um there's this question mark of what's called leap frogging so I interview um in my book uh Professor Kelly Sims Gallagher who runs the public policy school feter school at tus University um and worked in the White House under President Obama brokering the first deal between the US and China on climate change that set the ball rolling to get this Global agreement and basically the only way we were able to get that agreement was because China was seeing how polluted it was how dirty the sky was it was really at risk to Public Health it still is right and their citizens were like we've got to clean this up and so there was that internal political will built from the public health and citizen pressure um and the and the only way they could get the agreement though is that it was each country just committed to whatever they felt like they could commit to so we have this current framework of what's called nationally determined contributions where every country in the world it's a signatory to the Paris agreement gets to make up their own commitment and every five years there's a conference where you can ratchet that up where you can commit to more where there's an evaluation of how are we doing what else can we get together and do um so we actually have a really good framework in place through the United Nations to do this but it really depends on who's in office in these countries who's President who's prime minister is Congress actually appropriating the funds to put into this L and damage fund right because the president can't do that unfortunately a lot of this does come back to politics because you need the leaders of Nations to agree to do something you and I could be the best environmentalists with the lowest individual individual carbon footprints in the world but we still live in these systems where for most people you turn on the lights and you don't get to choose where electricity comes from most people don't own their homes or have the chance to afford the transition to Renewables as individuals so this has to be part of a bigger shift but I think we should also be framing this as a straightup upgrade like the air quality benefits alone I mean we're talking about nine million people dying a year because of air pollution because of fossil fuel burning right like even if there's no other benefit than having cleaner air that doesn't kill us I'll take it I don't know if you've ever listened to any of our our work but I'm a glass half empty kind of guy I just naturally come at all this as a pessimist which is one of my many flaws and one of the things I find really discouraging is that the level of excitement around cryptocurrency specifically Bitcoin and around AI just overwhelms the Inconvenient Truth that the incremental energy production because of Bitcoin is basically the electricity consumption of Argentina we've added Argentina such that we could figure out a new store of value and a new form of money which to me just seemed entirely unnecessary and then on the AI side AI queries are 13 to 17 times the energy consumption of a Google query and there's no slowing AI down there's not even really a discussion around in my view around attacks to put again to the it feels like in many instances we're actually headed the wrong way with some of the most I agree with you and I'm actually not an optimist um people read the title of my book what if we get it right and assume that I think we will get it right which is just not true right there's a question mark at the end of that like I don't know if we're going to get it together I know that we could make a much better future than we have than we're on track for right now like I'm a scientist I'm a realist I see the projections I know that we are on track for several more degrees of warning which means much more ice melting which means much more sea level rise which means much more heat waves and more droughts and floods and wildfires all of that is on the horizon I don't want to sugarcoat any of that the stakes are incredibly high and we are already of course experiencing these impacts and there's more to come even if we cap it all right now and you're right I mean the development of AI in particular there's an interview in um this book with Mustafa Suliman who is now the head of AI at Microsoft and talking to him about it I mean I personally am not a fan of AI but like we can't put the cap back in the bag so it's a question of like how do we best manage that industry and leverage it for good um but one of the statistics I learned while researching this book and of course these are moving targets as new data comes out but the the latest was that data centers in the US already consume about 2 and a half% of the US's total energy demand that was as of 2022 and that's expected to Triple to 7 and a half% by 2030 right we're talking about being on track for 10% of our energy being used by data centers on the Ezra Klein show you discussed how the climate crisis is in O was like 10 years ago we do our homework what did I say uh you actually said something really interesting you said that uh you thought that the climate crisis is an oceans crisis what did you mean by that so yes I'm a marine biologist by training I always think about um how the ocean gets neglected in all of this we know that the ocean has abs has absorbed about a third of the carbon dioxide that's been emitted by burning fossil fuels and that's made the ocean you explain how that happens like what is it in the ocean chemical reaction on the surface um I Heard it I thought it was the Krill or whale poop or something did there no oh that's the there's a broader carbon cycle in the ocean there's a like half of the you know some estimates are that about half of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean because of um photosynthesis of phytoplankton in the ocean um whale poop is a big part or was when there were more whales a big part of the carbon cycle because their poop sinks to the bottom of the ocean all this sort of marine snow it's called just like a bunch of animal poop in the ocean is heavy enough to sink and that ends up sequestering a significant amount of carbon through these natural cycles but as we overfish the ocean of course we're disrupting all of that um which is also a risk for deep sea mining disturbing all that carbon that has been sequestered down there potentially in the Quest for the metals for making batteries so all these things are complicated and have tradeoffs that we need to to consider um but on the ocean climate side I think there's two sides right there's the ocean as bearing a lot of the brunt of this so the ocean has become about 30% more acidic because has absorbed so much carbon dioxide um so the pH of the entire ocean has shifted which of course makes it harder for things with shells and skeletons corals to grow and shifts the way that animals navigate by smell and the Waters changing right because the chemistry of it has shifted um and then you have the fact that the ocean has warmed about a degre c because it's absorbed about 90% of the heat that we've trapped with all these greenhouse gases um emitted by burning fossil fuels and so without the ocean absorbing all that heat the planet would be about 97 degrees fenhe hotter obviously unlivable so we owe a big deut of gratitude to the ocean um but it's also estimated that on the solution side the ocean could be about 40% of our climate solution when we think about offshore renewable energies currently that's mostly wind power but looking at wave and tidle and other sorts of energy in the future as that technology develops thinking about how to decarbonize shipping which is still a huge um yeah people don't talk about shipping it's isn't it like a 8 or 12% of total carbon emissions something very large but there's a tricky thing with shipping where it also emits all of this soot because they tended to use really dirty um crude oil which actually helps to create like shade and soot which may have decreased warming and so by cleaning up shipping you're actually maybe making things hotter which is like this counterintuitive which is all to say like you know you pull on one thread and you see that it's connected to everything um but ocean ecosystems for example can absorb three five times more carbon per acre than a rainforest um and so we think so much whenever I do carbon credits they show a picture of a tree they should be showing a picture of a reef or something mangroves sea grasses Wetlands I mean I think they're just as sexy but maybe other people think it's just a bunch of mud given you're a scientist and you study this is there any one technology that you think is underrated in terms of the impact it could have or innovation that's you think it holds more promise and it's getting press on does composting count as technology sure it's a process right waste emits a huge amount of methane which is a greenhouse gas something like depending on what time scale you look at it 30 80% more potent than carbon dioxide so anytime you throw food in the trash and it ends up in a landfill and it's emitting methane that is very bad so composting food waste that technology of of nature breaking things down and then we have all the soil to grow new food and flowers and all that stuff I think on the energy side I actually don't want to pick a winner in technology because as Shaw says in this interview with him in the book um he's the head of the Loan program office at the department of energy which has something like $400 billion in loans that they can put out to energy companies to help support the innovation of new technologies um his perspective which I share is like we're always going to need a mix we wouldn't want to rely on all nuclear we wouldn't want to rely on all solar or all wind right it is that diversity that makes the system more resilient and so I personally like great I think Renewables are exciting um I think we should have that mix one technology I would really like to see especially in America is high-speed trains like why are we so behind on this right we're all flying short distances it's like if we could have trains from City Center to city center that were actually fast that would be faster than flying going through security getting there early whatever it would save us time and be such a more luxurious way to travel I mean that's not maybe the high technology you were thinking of but I think that would be transformative in significant ways especially for a country as large as ours do you think the political environment my sense is unfortunately or discour encouragingly I feel as if the last one or two years we've actually regressed as opposed to making progress what are your thoughts about the current political environment and the support we need to try and address these issues recently yeah I mean Trump is a candidate who periodically says climate change is a hoax right like that's a pretty hard scenario to be in when you're trying to advance Solutions um and I think it's important to remember that you know we had new Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi agreeing that we needed climate policy right not that long ago and like making a TV ad about it together but I'll also say on this political polarization piece that I don't debate climate science deniers I just I'm not the right messenger for that right like I'm not going to change anyone's mind on the Internet by telling them science facts like that's not how this is going to get fixed and so I think there's a big part of this we can actually skip talking about the problem right like let's go back to that example of wind energy booming in Ohio and Texas it's not because there was some big debate Statewide and they were like okay climate change is a problem we should develop this industry it's just cuz it makes sense and they're good jobs and it's profitable and we don't even have to talk about the why and the details right and I think we can kind of gloss over a lot of the problem and just agree on the solutions we'll be right back Dr Johnson you've you have a lot of influence at a very young age you got a big I'm 44 I'm not that young well okay it's all relative I just celebrate I just celebrated a birthday so 44 feels young but I'm just curious what and it seems like again from an Outsiders perspective everything looks great but it strikes me you have just the just the coolest job and you're doing something that you appear to really enjoy we have a lot of young people listen to the podcast what were some seminal moments for you in terms of figuring out you wanted to do this and sort of key break or key kind of turning points or your kind of break and that sort of leads into what we typically offer as a last question here what advice would you have um to your younger self I mean many many inflection points of course I think the thing that I keep going back to um is falling in love with nature and when I was five we went to Qs Florida and I learned to swim and snorkel and I saw a coral reef for the first time and I was just like Gob smacked that there was this super colorful Dynamic underwater world that I was like how come no one told me about this can this be my job to just hang out with these weird fish and that sort of started me off on that path but I had many I me marine biologist is a pretty common dream job for a 5-year-old yeah maybe it's literally something my son has said that he'd like to be a marine biologist actual job we could use the help um and I think though that like my dreams professionally evolved a lot right like a lot we each when I was 10 I wanted to be learning about the Civil Rights Movement I wanted to be the lawyer that got the next Martin Luther King out of jail I was like let me I want to support people who are fighting for justice and then I thought um you know I started camping and backpacking and I was like I could be a park ranger like I could get paid to just hang out in the forest like clearly that's the best job and then I started to get a little more Savvy about the policy and politics of it all and was like oh maybe enal lawyer is a good thing and then when I was ready to go to grad school I thought you know there's a lot of lawyers in the world maybe I could approach this question from the science side and like meet the lawyers and policy folks in the middle and so that's what I decided to do but always it was this interdisciplinary approach of Science and policy and politics and economics and culture because it's that crazy puzzle that we have to solve complicated and unlikely though it may be but the the advice I guess I would give to my former self which I now actually give to everyone is to really think about what you specifically can do not just what needs to be done um the way that each person can contribute to addressing the climate crisis is going to be different and so I have this concept this framework of a climate action diagram and the idea is just three circles and the first circle is what are you good at so like what's specifically are you bringing to the table your skills your resources your networks right like what do you have to offer and the second circle is what work needs doing what are the climate and Justice Solutions you want to focus on like maybe Fusion is your thing right maybe your thing is making sure you know we have people's votes be counted in this country so we have a better chance of getting climate policy etc etc so and then the third is what brings you Joy and that's going to sound like you know Silly probably to a lot of your listeners um who are like give me the glass half empty version but I think the opportunity is that this is really work for the rest of our lives to sort of turn this mess around and so if we choose to do something that's miserable even if we're good at it it's just going to be awful and there's so much that needs doing why would you pick something that's not pleasant in some way or satisfying gratifying and so doing this like actual exercise with colored pencils myself was how I ended up co-founding Urban ocean lab a think tank for the future of coastal cities as a marine biologist and a policy nerd and a girl from Brooklyn concerned about um coastal cities getting impacted by climate change and someone who finds a lot of joy in changing the rules of the game um and design and communication and collaboration all of those things came together in that way for me but of course like not everyone should start an ocean policy th take uh so that's my recommendation is like really think about like your bespoke um offering to climate Solutions Dr iyan Elizabeth Johnson is a marine biologist policy expert writer and Brooklyn native she is co-founder of the nonprofit Think Tank Urban ocean lab and the climate initiative the all we can save project she's also the co-creator of the podcast how to save a planet Dr Johnson's new book what if we get it right visions of climate Futures is out now she joined us from her hometown of Brooklyn Dr Johnson We are rooting for you we appreciate your time thank you thanks for having me
