what's up everybody on today's episode of the SAS Academy podcast we're talking to Cedric chin Cedric is one of my favorite writers as of late he is literally changed the way that I think about data in SAS and the way that I use the data in my own company on his articles on his website common.com he's just one of the best thinkers in this space and we're going to go super deep and super nerdy on this episode of the podcast so if you are a SAS founder you're running a company or you're a COO or just anyone that cares about making datadriven decisions in business get out a pen get out a piece of paper because this is an episode you're not going to want to miss Cedric welcome to the show man I'm Johnny Paige I'm Matt verl and this is the South Academy podcast welcome welcome welcome cedrick chin my man how are you welcome to SAS Academy podcast I'm fired up to get nerdy and talk about data man so thank you for letting us steal a few minutes from you I appreciate it yeah thank you for setting this up totally totally totally so before we do all of the Ops fun punch list that I have in my head I'd love to go back for a minute because you have this concept you talk about about believability and essentially like why should you listen to a certain person based on their experiences and when we were talking right before we started recording you know it was the same thing of like let's get your track record out there and talk about why anyone should listen to this conversation because I think as we go into the conversation we're going to challenge a lot of beliefs about how to use data and how to build systems in a business and so before we get into that like what's been your your road map you've helped scale a couple of businesses like why you why are we having this conversation just like bring people into your world right uh so believability is this idea from uh Ray Dalo uh of Bridgewater and he's taken you know his reputation is taking a drubbing right now right because there's this book that comes out that's actually pretty makes him look like a horrible person but believability is a useful concept and so I I think the concept still stands right even though like the way he uses it in his film at least as portrayed in in this book callede The Fun by Rob kopin isn't that great but you know so now I when I explain believability have to put up this disclaimer because like some of your listeners probably might have read the book but believability is just this common sense thing right which is like if you the way I like to phrase it is like if you're asking for swimming advice right you don't go and talk to someone who has never swam before they don't they don't know how to swim you go talk to an Olympic uh you know maybe an Olympic swimmer or a professional competitive swimmer and to get swimming advice right but for some reason we seem to forget this when we're on Twitter scrolling with social media LinkedIn right we're reading people sort of talking about like how to run your SAS business or how how to run your business in general and you just like oh this sounds like great advice right without actually stopping to ask that what have they actually accomplished are they actually aummer have they actually done this before right and the reason this is important is because um uh people are like I feel this keenly as a writer right it's possible I know as a writer that I can write things that sound very convincing right and have actually very little backing it so I wrote an essay a couple years ago called beware what sounds insightful and I think this is uh this captures sort of the problem as a business operator as a business owner you need to um um uh watch what kind of advice you take because there's a lot of plausible sounding advice out there that would uh send you down the wrong path and the problem with smart people who can write very plausible sounding advice is that um it sounds it sounds correct it sounds right right and and and and the the the real sort of Crux um that will catch you is that uh when you're implementing something a lot of fiddly details matter right and so when somebody gives you advice they have to naturally because this is the nature of reality cut certain things out right and I've listened to a number of your podcasts your guests are the your guests who are believable are able to tell you like this thing matters that thing doesn't or that thing isn't as important so I'm not going to talk about it right I'm giving you advice I'm going to just focus on the two three things that really matter when you're trying to put X or Y to practice um and people who are smart who can write really well who sound very convincing but have never done the thing they can give you an incredibly detailed picture about things that don't matter and then you will waste like months of your life so believability as as as a sort of tight ly defined is the person has three examples of successes in the thing that you're asking them for and they have a uh like a articulate uh internally consistent view uh of how they accomplished it when you probe them right so they have to have this these two things and the way I sort of like uh uh write Common Cog is is like I would lay out my believability say here's my experience uh and you will notice actually that as I'm talking about these my believability is actually not very high on data right um the so there is a hierarchy of of of practical evidence here I would say that like Colin Brier who was the early Amazonian that I learned many of these ideas from he is believable he's done it more than three times I am doing it for the first time now right but the way I sort of structure and I'm very clear about it on common Cog is that the highest level is believability you've got three successes you've got a coherent explanation when you when you are probed below that is U you're not beli you're you're kind of believable U sorry actually I should take a step back and go like there's actually a hierarchy of practical evidence that I use the highest thing is I have tried it and it works for me so I know that it works number two is beyond that if is you're asking you're getting advice from other people uh they're believable believable here meaning you know the the the do definition tree successes and a cerent explanation and they have skin in the game which means that they have they're exposed to downside outcomes if things go badly for them right the layer below that is just believability and then the layer below that is I I have tried it and here's what I found that is still useful to you as an operator right the person might not be believable but because there are a few steps on the journey ahead of you they failed they've tried this you can proe them for like hey tell me what you've done tell me how you're thinking about this how have you what has wored what has failed and then finally the lowest level is possible argument like okay you you know there's lots of smart people who can write well can talk well um you are the but you are actually the lowest level on the hierarchy of practical evidence if you're an operator so that's like the whole setup I know I took a very long amount of time with that but um basically my background is I uh ran a the Vietnam side software U software office for a Singaporean company and the Singapore company started out as an Outsourcing company um and then we pivoted and this is mostly my boss not me um I enabled him to go and seek out business opportunities because I was holding the forth operationally on the Vietnam side which is where all the software Engineers were we switched to point of sale uh point a point of sale business where we sold point of sale uh Point of Sales to companies mostly in Singapore and within a few weeks we were it was clear that we were on to something uh I tell a story in a members only blog post uh on common Cog um and the short of it is that at the end of three years we build it from nothing to 4.5 million in annual Rec not recurring and no revenue and then after that after I left uh because my deal with my boss was like oh you know like I want what you have I want to run my own business you're happy you you're successful and the company's now doing so well that my boss is basically uh he can retire if he wants so he's hit his number um and then I left I started common Cog uh I was trying to learn content marketing when I was originally writing the blog I was trying to put together make sense of a lot of my business experiences running the the the Post company um and then I helped a friend uh with content marketing for his SAS company it's a business intelligence visualization tool and at the end of that uh it was two years with him and end of that I sort of said like hey uh nothing that I'm doing is really pushing the needle here like I'm producing content marketing but your sales is not really you know you can't really I can't really say that I've helped you increase sales let's do a repositioning exercise and I basically did uh April Dunford is this remarkable marketing uh person who has written a book called obviously awesome which at the time I was year into it I read it a year ago I mean a year when I put the thing to practice and within the next eight months with no additional marketing span what happened was the top of funnel uh collapsed uh and and you know people were sort of inside the company were freaking out a little especially if they're sales train because you know if you have a sales funnel and the top funnel collapses that's horrible but the bottom of funel the dollar Clos like I think triple and the anal that story is basically after an eight Monon period uh the company doubled this was a seven figure number the anal recurring Revenue with no additional marketing span and then I left um yeah there's a lot there um we're starting off with high velocity man so I love it the first thing that that I'll push on I love the five different levels around believability that index down from like firsthand experience but the thing that I found really interesting that I actually didn't catch when I read your blog post about it is that you also work the incentive structure into the way that you evaluate it right I thought the skin in the game point was really really important right where it's like essentially you hold that advice into in a higher regard than if it's just advice without any downside yeah yes yes absolutely and I'm sure you've you've you've experienced this as well um I'm primarily in Asian operating context and so I deal with a lot of traditional CH I could I'm traditional Chinese businessman because that's the trop in my part of the world I'm sure you know people like this right people who are Inc they're like sharks right they they they never went to school maybe you know like they drop out of school they learn business from the school of heart KN and they are incredibly sharp and it's actually useful to you as an entrepreneur to learn how to learn from them right and and they usually they're typically not very optically right so it's like how do you learn from them and and I found that uh um yeah they're not very optic but it's it pays attention uh when you say you're doing a deal with them um if they give you advice and there is some downside risk for them pay very close attention to their advice and try to figure out what they're actually saying because it's likely that the advice is going to be very good and so that's like one of the ways you can use this believability thing um not just to evaluate stuff you're reading online but stuff that people you're parties you're dealing with or business people you're dealing with in the course of running your company because that's an incredible learning opportunity many of these people are like decades in business right so you want to sort of get at their intuition which is hard to get in a book or a podcast I like it man I like it so when you've so you scaled epos to four and a half in three years then you ran April's play by the way we're big April fans here at SAS Academy so April Dunford if you're listening to this what's up um you're the best and and essentially like that's interesting too and it t I think it leads itself into a data driven conversation here in a minute but like essentially seeing the top of the funnel claps and the bottom of the funnel that cash collected actually double simultaneously like that's such an interesting outcome because it would both terrify people on the in the front but also like it's actually a very positive signal that the the whole system probably quadrupled in efficiency right so like how do you reconcile that like how do you get people who don't see that off the break to actually understand it so um I need to talk a little bit about a dfits uh uh Whatchamacallit a framework um her framework is about positioning and positioning is basically it's it's a bit hard to explain but you can sort of think about it as the frame on your product right so um if you are selling a SAS product and people are saying like but you know this is a business intelligence tool so the typical things like how you different from T or how you different from a where a is the incumbent the big product in your category right um and the whenever you're hearing things like this you know that you're not sufficient you're not well positioned because if you're well positioned they should not compare you to the incumbent they should compare you with somebody who you regard as being close to you in your Market space and you have to remember that customers April stes a lot you know your customers are not experts in your industry vertical you are so of course you see gradations of like different products are clustered differently in your Market but most of your customers don't right so April is like how do you position it uh in a way that uh gets you the best fit customers that you want right um and and and when I say it like this of course it's clear um to anybody listening that you will automatically cut off people who are not best fit customers which means that your top of fun will collapse or should collapse right so um with this particular example uh without sort of revealing too many details um I I basically like asked the founders for like the best fit customers like give me like 10 right and then we listen to the sales calls and then we will cluster them into like here are the major sort of like jobs to be done or pain points that we s for them pick one and they picked one and then we and then the the the end point is of course you rewrite the landing page and you rewrite all your documentation your marketing Focus but before you do that because the the the the feedback loop on changing your marketing material is too long what we started to do is basically April dunit Dunford did not say this in her first book The positioning book right which is obviously awesome but she later said it in uh sales pitch which is her second book which came out you know very recently much long after I i' done this exercise right for the team um and so I had to like listen to like every April dunit podcast out there to like because she talked about it but she didn't put it in the book right what you need to do is you need to iterate in the on the sales pitch because that's the highest feedback loop quickest feedback loop to sort of figure out if the repositioning exercise is working and the and I still remember to this day um um what we we figured out we figured out a 1.5 thing that we would say at at the sales cour after the initial like sort of asking questions and building Rao and figuring out like what you know your background why you're coming uh to this sales conversation and there's a demo right that's a typical sales code structure there's questions and then there's a demo right in between in that little bit right before the demo you say one a 1.5 minute thing right and we B and it was basically something like um before I show you the demo let me explain our point of view uh on the market like why we built the the the thing that we did right um and we built it because there is a particular way of doing data right and we we made it very polarizing right so we said like if if you want to do data the old way you know then we're not for you go talk to T go do powerbi but if you want to do data in this new very tightly defined way um then we can continue talking right um and we train salespeople to sort of look at your customer and sort of read their body language if they cross their arms and lean back in the chair try to end the call in the next five minutes don't go into the demo don't waste your time right and if they lean forward and say tell me more then you can go into the demo and then you can sort of customize it do the typical sales thing right and after we sort of validated that then we rewrote the landing page and so therefore we filter for people with that worldview um so that's like the short story of it and and you know at the end of it um one of the marketing people that I taught this to who stayed on after I left right she she was like um hey you you know we shouldn't be freaking out about top of funel collapsing right because our Bottom Dollar close is triple so like things are going wow you don't you don't have to hire more salespeople and and and that that ultimately was what sort of uh kept them U you know not not going crazy I love it and you know so I'm going to switch gears for a sec but I think it it relates to what you just explained which is like the the moral of the story is you found this 90-second talk track that ended up unlocking the position and you essentially by by making the system more efficient were able to let the team run more lean save on would have been excess highers lower margins the whole nine yards and double revenue and so taking that principle and like zooming out for a minute you know the thing that introduced me to you over the internet was the series that you put together about what it means to be data driven right I know it's still in progress and I think you're working on like the the Capstone article on the wbr right now um but if you had to like in you know a couple of minutes time frame if someone wasn't going to go read all you know your entire series on it yet if you were talking to an entrepreneur and they said I want to be data driven Cedric what the hell do I do right like how do you set the table for someone who's like I'm looking at my numbers I don't really know if I'm doing it the right way like what is it how do I do this right like what are you telling that person right um so there is a blog post that you can just read one blog post uh I I I had to write it because I had to Grapple with exactly this problem right U maybe I'll do some setup first so the blog post is is called becoming data driven from first principles and um just to take another step back right how I came into this topic was I i' run two companies and you can say like in an operational role you can say that I'm quite successful right because both of them were seven figure outcomes right I just came in and like I've definitely generated inaccess of seven figures uh for both companies but I've never run a I've never been data driven I've never been in a company that's actually being data driven and I would wager that the vast majority of your uh uh customers uh of the people listening to this podcast even if you're running assess even if you're very successful you are likely not as data driven as um Amazon was in the early days Amazon's weird they're spectral um that isn't to say that you're not effective as a business entrepreneur right uh Colin always Colin Brier who was this early Amazon executive who I learned this from like to say that business found Founders and business operators can have good intuition and that's not discounted um it the quest the problem is if you're scaling your company beyond your intuition that you've learned through the school of heart knots as a Founder as an entrepreneur right then you start need to start like relying on something more than just intuition because you can scale your intuition right you know what to do maybe the rest of the people in your company might not know what to do so then you need data so I came out of the the entire sort of uh experience with this SAS company right um and I was reflecting on the fact that I didn't really know how to be data driven I was also reflecting on the fact that I listened to a lot of sales calls in that role in that in that sth company and a lot of them even though they were buying data tools were not data driven right um and so I wanted to figure out like what does it mean to be data driven and and so I was writing this blog common Cog and I turned on memberships for it um eventually it became like it's it's about business expertise right how do you accelerate business expertise and I wrote a summary of this book called working backwards which was released uh I think like two years ago three years ago now three years ago I think um by two early Amazon Executives who were on the S team s team is the highest level team basically Jeff bezos's team executive theme um it's got uh working backwards by Colin Brier and Bill Carr all right and Colin reached out he said hey you know you wrote the summary of the book um you seem to understand what we were getting at you technical I can see from your resume um we are interested in explicating chapter six chapter six is about the weekly Business Review uh which is Amazon's approach to metrics um we now run a consulting company and we want to teach this to our clients uh but it turns out that what we wrote In the book is not enough can you help us uh extract ract like what this knowledge in our heads to write a series of internal documents that we can give to our clients um and we also like hiring we're also writing some software can you like because you're technical you can read the code you can test it and you can help build the WB software that we are using uh we're giving to clients for free um so I said sign me up like please tell me like how to become data driven right and to sort from the right that's great yeah yeah I mean to sort of set a table here the wbr is this thing that happened every Wednesday morning and every metric every executive of not every person who's important um sits down and goes true 400 to 500 metrics in an hour and I asked uh Colin was it really an hour I said yeah yeah it's it's always 60 minutes unless it's the holiday season in which case it's 90 minutes and they are militant about making sure that it it fits it hits fits inside that very tight time bucket right um specifically 500 500 metrics Ines 500 metrics 500 metrics in 60 minutes yes yes and it's a it represents the business end to end right so like from uh uh you've got traffic on one side of the wbr all the way to uh Financial metrics like free cash flow uh inventory turns working capital on the other side right so you can sort of almost see like from end to end like how's the business doing across multiple uh uh uh you know there multiple business lines Amazon right now right um and uh to sort of give you more detail what happened happens is that every Sunday night uh the wbr is generated Monday morning every metric has a metrics owner they come in they take a look at the metric and they sort of identify is this something worth talking about is this routine or exceptional variation we'll talk about that in a moment right U if there is something weird going on investigate Tuesday the departmental wbr happens which is the Department's uh wbr they go into the metrics they're supposed to explain weird things um and then Wednesday is the wbr the actual top level wbr where you have to present like what's going on right um and you have there's basically only two things if it's your metric and it's perfectly normal you say nothing to see here let's move on everybody looks at it for one second because it's important to look at a metric even for one second to build a fingertip field imagine you do this every week and you look at every metric for one second you get an idea of what normal feels like and if something is wrong then you say hey this is wrong we're not on track to H Target we have to go we investigate it uh we don't know what's going on or uh it's a strike right or is a hurricane that hit like this particular like fulfillment center so like our deliveries are off um anyway so I learned the wbr I started putting it into practice with kcog and what the wbr actually is is that it's not really a data reporting meeting it is a process control tool and I'll explain what that is in a second but basically what it should do is it should give you as you're running it a causal model of how your business actually works so I've said this online I said this I said I I we doubled uh Rec recurring Revenue because I'm now I'm running a membership site right um over the past year I am confident that I can at least double if not triple recurring Revenue this year because I actually know what levels exist that I can pull right to uh accelerate Revenue growth or like pursue Revenue growth um and I I think there's a lot to get into there so maybe I'll just stop here first and like you you decide where you want to go there yeah I see Johnny leaning in can you talk more about the you you said uh they make a decision on Mondays whether or not it's within the normal range of variants or uh an exception I can't remember the two terms you Ed but yes can you talk more about that sure okay so um I I I tried to teach the wbr to my operator friends my founder friends right and I kept failing and at some point I realized that the the ideas that the WB draws from are counter intuitive in the sense that they're not widely spread um and so I needed to write a block post which is probably how Matt you know like why Matt invited me on so this blog post I highly recommend that if you're listening to this you should go read it because it gets into much more detail it's called becoming data driven from first principles right um and it introduces this key concept which is routine versus exceptional variation right so why why is it okay wait the the the essay goes like this why do we want want to be data driven in business and the answer to this uh according to um W Edwards steming who is the creator of this uh body of work right that the wbr draws from um is that the purpose of data is knowledge knowledge is defined as theories or models that allow you to better predict the results of your business action now this is actually quite intuitive right because if you are making a hiring decision right you're basically saying oh you you you're deciding to you know pay for marketing campaign you are saying that I predict that by hiring this this software engineer or the salesperson or this hiring Campaign Will result in good outcomes X Y and Z for my business down the line couple months down the line you are making a prediction so Deming like to say that management is prediction right the question is are you actually basing your actions on actro knowledge knowledge meaning predictive knowledge that I do this I will get X outcome down the the line right so data is supposed to give you this right and maybe most most entrepreneurs who are good do have an intuitive feel for what will work predictive feel for what will work right the question again is like how do you spread this Beyond just yourself so that your entire team executes with knowledge right so okay with that in mind right then the question becomes like why is it so hard to become data driven right and Deming also had a very uh good answer to this which is that the problem with becoming data driven is that all your metrics will wiggle and I I I I like to say this like you know when I was running the the website have I just ask in the room like how many of you have opened a Google analytics dashboard and just felt confused like like is this good is this bad like it's wiggling it's going up and down right like maybe yesterday I had a thousand visitors and today I have 500 is that bad right um is the trend going up how do I tell what do I conclude from looking at this Google analytics graph of visitors to my website right the the problem that most of us have is that we cannot deal with the wiggling in our business metrics and our business metrics are always wiggling sometimes very wildly right um so Deming introduces this concept like this is this entire body of work if you're interested it's called statistical process control it was used in World War II to scale up production right to produce uh weapons and material for the allies and then later it was used in Japan to completely rebuild their industrial base and the basic idea is that if the variation the wiggling is normal this is called routine variation if it's not normal you need to go investigate and that's called exceptional variation and in Amazon the reason why the wbr can be done in such a in a 60 Minute period right is because they only talk about exceptions they only talk about metrics that have exceptional variation right so you can imagine you can actually compress quite a lot of metrics if you just nothing's here nothing's here okay exceptional variation this is the root cause and this is what we're doing to try to fix it next nothing's here nothing's here nothing's here right um so okay how do you differentiate between routine and exceptional variation this is the big problem right um I so in in in my essay I talk about a way to uh bootstrap intuition um in Amazon they don't use this way right the way is a very dumb chart called an XMR chart right and the XMR chart is a very nice looking chart where it just draws two lines above and below your metric that way goals and he has a set of tre rules that tells you like investigate only when you see these Tre signals right otherwise if it's wiggling you can ignore it that's just that's just routine variation you might not like it you might have a sales process where that goes down like you know week to week 40% so last week was great this week is 40% down right but that's the nature of your metric right and you just have to accept that this variation even if you don't like it is normal you shouldn't ask somebody to investigate it because it's just going to wiggle and wiggle that wildly with 40% swings right as per usual right um Amazon doesn't have doesn't use XMR charts uh universally right uh but uh Colin is like very clear that like if you look at metrics long enough you will develop this intuition for what is normal what is abnormal and you don't need an XMR chart the XMR chart is just a way to quickly bootstrap the intuition of what is normal what is not and um unfortunately I tried to build the intuition uh and I couldn't and so I have no choice now everybody in my team uses XMR charts because it turns out that we're not that good uh maybe people in Amazon who have been looking at it for years can but it turns out that we are not that great yet and I'm hoping that in a year's time you talk to me I can say like yeah we don't need maxr charts anym we can we can look at a metric and go like this is normal this is not does that answer your question yeah it answers the question I'm curious so we work with Founders who go from 10K in monthly recurring Revenue up to 10 million and early on if you were to apply the Amazon method you would spend all your time as a business of you know two to three people all your time collecting the data right and so there is a high I would imagine early on there's a high degree of intuition and that over time as a business matures we should phase off that what are the signals that would tell you hey I I need to be I need to change and how do you actually like build the appreciation I think you you're you're you're defining what does it look like to be data driven is help what does it look like as a Founder like transitions from the intuitive phase to the data driven phase and what can make them like more Embrace that process because you could imagine if the thing that has gotten you results so far is your intuition it's hard to set that down unless you encounter one a better way or some pain so I think one of the one of the things could be your business starts going sideways or it starts going backwards you make some bad decisions if you don't want to have to like go to the school Hard Knocks and learn that your intuition is no longer sufficient what are the signals that you start to see when you see Founders and teams go through this process of from predominantly intuitive decision- making to datadriven decision- making what's that process look like right so this is one of my big bug Bears um uh after you read the the essay like I I remember uh one or two product people sort of reach up to me and say holy [ __ ] this is a way to uh bootstrap my intuition for like what actually works in my business um wait so let me let me sort of explain that a little how how do you TR tral and error bu intuition right how do do do most Founders work in the early days of a startup they try things right they try things and then maybe it works maybe it doesn't um and and but then when you ask them like how do you know it works you like Oh by feel by feel and and usually the feeling does work but it takes longer than expected right um the XMR if you use this sort of data driven approach right uh what what the XMR chart is is it's a magical tool you can say it's a magical tool it's a tool that tells you when something that you've done has actually changed the pattern of wiggling in your numbers you think about that for a moment that's a that's a radical thing to have in your in your pocket right before if you're trying to change your sales process you have to wait a bit and then everybody goes like uh you think it work I think it work I think it's a good idea okay yeah okay then we might take a month or you might be like let's wait another month and see see right if it's a good idea has made an impact on outcomes and then like after that then you're like oh I think I think it worked so therefore let's let's try another Improvement assuming that that's actually you know something that we know that works right and then you try again and you like it's by feel and most Founders eventually build this like this comfort with like you never actually know now imagine right instead of doing that right you have a tool that you're looking at and you try something and then you wait like x amount of time months or weeks right you have to Define like how long you expect it to show up in the number that you're tracking and then the tool tells you it changed or it didn't change the wiggling change or it didn't change it changeed to a different higher level of wiggling right if you have that confidence right that hey it actually changed then you know you have actual knowledge that the thing that you tried to change in your process actually worked you can move on to the next experiment right most SAS Founders that I know or most Founders that I know they said that I don't look at data I I I learn from talking to the customer because when you talk to the customer there's no problem of variation there's no wiggling you get actual information that is predictive that is knowledge right or I'm saying with this approach is that now you have two weapons you don't just have to rely on qualitative interviews you can also have an ability a tool that tells you when something has changed after you've made that change right has the has it actually impacted some Metric that you care about right and that Clarity is everything so one thing that bring that that that that I bring up or that I encountered again and again it took me a while to sort of put a finger on this right is that um there are actually two World Views when it comes to data and the wbr and this body of work is a is is a is this second counter intuitive worldview so the default worldview that most of us have when it comes to data right it's something that I call the optimization revew we look at a number and then we say how can I make this number go up um and how that expresses itself is that we look at some number on some funnel some marketing or sales funnel we look at okay we say like oh we want to make sales go up right um and the slightly more sophisticated person would say oh let's take a look at this number in the context of this funnel let's take a look at the the conversion steps on each stage of the funnel Let's uh uh let's ask how can we increase the conversion steps for this step of the funnel that that step of the funnel and then that's it and the other way this expresses itself is that you set a revenue Target for yourself oh you know by second half of this year we want to have like a 133% increase in sales without any mention of the mechanism right you just set the goal because the big harry audacious goal is going to motivate you to figure out a way to hit a Target right so that's a default way that most of us look at think when we look at data the worldview that the WB encourages and that Ding and you know this whole XMR chart approach uh encourages is something I call the process control worldview because this is a term that Colin used that amazonians use what is the process control worldview the process control worldview tells you that your business is a process you can decompose that process into multiple smaller processes and do that frally right and your job is to look at a stream of numbers as a stream of numbers produced by a certain process in your business and you only have one job your job is I will give you a data tool that will tell you if that stream of numbers have changed either because of something in the environment has changed that you don't know about or it's because it's the result of a change that you have made to the process right and once you see a change the data tool tells you that there's a change your job is to go investigate uh to go investigate and see like what is the root cause that causes that change because that gives you knowledge of how to budge that stream of numbers and as you do this you uncover new things that you need to track right like for example um uh my business common Cog is a membership publication and uh it turns out that if you tweet a lot there is a linear relationship to visits but there is zero impact on my number of new newsletter subscribers The reason I know this is because I've been running the wbr and I have this tool in my pocket right and so therefore that tells me I should not be spending that much time I should not really give a [ __ ] about Twitter right um conversely one day we got a link from a substack and we saw exceptional variation on all the metrics that I care about inp readers number of new starter subscribers what does it tell me that tells me that I should focus most of my marketing energy on other suback uh uh authors to sort of see that maybe I should spin up a new starter ad campaign right or maybe I should go and reach out to other subst writers and like do collabs right this is knowledge this tells me that my the per unit return on going of the substack it's that much higher than Twitter andin right um sorry can I cedra can I up can I ask a question so so you saw exceptional variation in all of these metrics did you see that first and then ask the question what changed and then you were like oh this person on substack published this link that's cool yes so that it was a it was a week in October we just saw uh we open a wbi we saw exceptional variation across multiple metrics again my WB is structured L like the Amazon one it's a traffic metrics here and Revenue metrics at the end and then it's new the metrics in the middle right so um the model the the causal the causal model the business that I had in my head at the time um which I now know is wrong is that people sign up to become newsletter subscribers and then they sign up to become paying members I now know that that's actually not true uh the VA this is knowledge again like the vast majority of people who sign up to become common comp members uh they actually read the the blog before signing off for the new St before they sign up before they pay become a paying member but at the time it was like one of the metrics I care about was like how can I grow my new stter list because that unlocks certain marketing opportunities like audience swaps or what have you right um and so I was looking for things that would actually move that needle and I knew that posting on LinkedIn and posting on Twitter would give me traffic it was a linear relationship uh because I track the controllable input matric of like how many tweets Treads do I do how many LinkedIn posts do I do and then I look at the traffic uh what do you call it um attributed to LinkedIn and and Twitter um and in this particular case I knew that it was like it's not that useful right uh so the reason I brought this up is because like when you're using this this approach this process control approach it gives you root causes right and so now one metric I I'm not doing this right now because we're still trying to figure out like what kinds of newsletters produce the best results this is again pursuit of knowledge but say that I figured it out right then the number of Outreach attempts becomes a controllable input metric that I should track and that should be part of the wbr because there is a that is a leading indicator to a like output metric which is the number of visitors and then the number of people who sign up for my new stter right so Amazon calls this controllable input metric and output metric but the idea is the same thing you you have a tool that tells you when your metric has changed as a result of something that you've made some experiment you've done you go and start tracking that root cost and you start incentivizing your teams to go pursue that root cost and you know there is a causal relationship between that root CA and the metric that you care about interesting yeah yeah I think this is this podcast is going to is going to result in some homework on our on our scorecard oh well this is my whole angle I just want to implement this process in our company so I wanted to bring Cedric on the podcast so you could hear it from him so then I can go move a whole lot of things off my plate to go do this it's actually just I'm playing 40 chess with you guys it's perfect there we go I love it yeah um the it's so different right from the default approach that most of us have with regard to data right we most of us by into we we want we just look at the number and go like how do I make this number go up but the reason this process control worldview is so much more useful is because it gives you a mechanism right it says that hey here is a a way of looking at data that is actually something that we're all very good at it we what we are good at as human beings is TR and error we learn to walk through TR and error we learn you know when you're climbing a tree and you fall off the tree you're like oh let's not do that again right but when it comes to data we can't use data as part of our feedback mechanisms to do Tron error because of the variation so just giving you a tool that cuts through that noise that tells you investigate this ignore that wiggling right allows you to do trial and error again and business people Founders operators we're just naturally good at try out they just just try [ __ ] out right so that's why I could see the the the variation causing some of the hesitancy to use data but I don't know if it's the main reason why clients aren't you or you know um business Founders not using data I would argue that it is the effort to produce the data and to trust it like so all of the Integrity leading up to it being like I could trust that that number is right how do you what is true about the organizations that you've either ran yourself or have uh worked with that solves for those two problems because the Vari would be like after that fact like I I I'll tell you like for years I've operated where I've I've always had a scorecard in the business where where I look at every week we're looking at and we go traffic light system so that's kind of a our traffic light is not based on the variation but it's based on on track or off track if it's off track we talk about it um but for years it has been like do I trust this number or is there a little asteris to be like look I look at it a but there's some things that will cause the variation about our ability to track it um that I don't know I'm curious like how do you how do you build up the trust to in how the data is collected stored reported so that that isn't doesn't become part another reason why someone wouldn't be data driven keeps leaning on intuition right um so the way that I tell them to start is they put the numbers in a spreadsheet yeah we do the same thing spreadsheet just a spreadsheet um don't you don't need to care about high futin technology or like you know fancy systems and Engineering just put it in a spreadsheet and when you yourself as a business owner looks at look at a spreadsheet you can you can automatically ask like oh where's this number from right or like where do you get this number from and the the the anecdote they like to give is like Amazon ran a multi a billion dollar business off of Excel spreadsheets because the original wbr was basically a bunch of macros on Excel spreadsheets that some peon would collect from each department and then on Sunday night would put it in a share Drive the worst job ever man yeah but he ran a billion dollar business right it was it was because Amazon's leadership U came from manufacturing these ideas are all from manufacturing and they knew the importance of gaining knowledge right so but to answer your question you put it I think first of all in a spreadsheet because it's people are not scared of spreadsheets and uh people are also very used to sort of quering like sort of asking like hey is this number for in a spreadsheet right and and then you you put it around some process that the business really cares about and I found that it's usually sales right so you start implementing it just for sales just for sales you just say like hey don't you want to know what has actually moved the needle in sales or or do you want to like you know uh go and pursue investigate random drops right when actually you shouldn't investigate that because it's just routine variation you're not going to find a root cause if it's routine variation you're only going to find a root cost if it's one of the tree signals of an XMR there's some exceptional variation going on um so you tell this to people they tend to be quite receptive right because they're like oh what can I actually do to move the needle on sales right and then you say okay let's sit down let's map out the what the sales funnel looks like in your head most people again have a good understanding of what a sales funnel is right um and then you say that what are some of the metrics that you want to track give like pretend that we can track anything first and then we'll talk about what we actually have access to right and it could be just manually ENT entering numbers every week in uh a spreadsheet which is actually what we still do like in in in common talk um so once you do that then you'll be like okay let's dump it on XML chart and see what our routine range of variation looks like right and then now you've got two questions that you want to improve you the XMR chart is basically there's the wiggling line and there's two lines above and below what it tells those two lines tells you is that your number should to normal operation swing between the two lines and when you look at that those two lines you might say [ __ ] that those two lines are too wide I don't like it I don't like the fact that in a given week 1% of the time it's actually possible for sales to drop to like zero right so then the your job becomes how do I tighten the line and how do I shift the line up right um and then it becomes like a Tron Arrow let's just try things and the chart will tell us if it's actually worked right so you try experiments and what's going to quickly happen is that you're going to realize and I tell people this like most of the things you're going to try initially are not going to work and that is knowledge that tells you that your intuition is actually wrong and now you're on the path to actually build knowledge about what like bootstrap proper real intuition what actually works in changing your sales process so I tell sorry I I I tght this to a Sal founder a friend and he applied this to his sales process and to tr era again using part his intuition he realized that the the number one thing that can shift the entire range up right is um built into the sales process after you close and number of days after you close the sales rep reaches out to the customer and says hey is there anybody else that you know in any other company that would like our product and it just happens to be the type of product where that's actually very possible very D they're very happy even if it's competitors to like you know like go go give you uh tell you to to to refer you to to the to the sales rep um and if you do this like the uput metric that he cared about which is like close dollar first it was like number of sales calls new leads and then after that Dollar close went up it shifted um and then he so he started tracking number of times s people did this Outreach after close uh step right you can call it whatever metric you want and because you are tracking the controllable input metric and the output metric and you expect you over time you sort of have an expected lag value like how much time would lag for it to show up in the output metric right um he driving both up he started the interesting part of the story is that he realized that uh the controllable input metric which is the number of Outreach attempts to these people uh to to people you just closed was going up and up and up but then the output metric was not going up as much and then he investigated and founded a couple of his salespeople uh were actually like you know they were they were making half ass calls or they were just trying to like hit the number without actually doing the the full process so this thing also allows you to capture when there's like this good Hearts law type situation going on right um but you can see sort of like because you have knowledge that this works you can immediately move on to the next TR and everything thing whereas if you didn't have this tool this approach you might be going like I think it works I think it works and you waste like two months when you actually could have known that it worked and moved on to the next experiment that's interesting is it is it common that the data hygiene the way you use the CRM is a real obstacle to getting to the point where you're data driven because that's like all I'm thinking is like even if if you start in the sales process yes the I just go through the dozens of memories I have of like trying to get my sales team to actually put the [ __ ] in the CRM so I could see the controllable inputs I could see the lagging measures like am I am i m how how do you overcome that you have to almost like get to a point where the value that all of that hygiene creates is outweighs the pain in the ass that it is to you know input every deal interaction uh or activity into the CRM yes that is 100% a a problem I'm not going to sugarcoat it it's like I mean process control is controlling a process and that means like having a good process right um yeah in some ways it's easier to get data hygiene in marketing right but the problem there is that the feedback loop is too long so I don't recommend starting there right um it's also possible to get good uh uh uh data hygiene oh no this this this depends really on the the people running the process but Amazon uses uh process control for hiring as well during periods where hiring is a problem it's a root cause to like they can't hit some of their kpis they realize that actually the Upstream problem is that they they have problems so what did they do they subject the hiring to process control they put it in the wbrr and like suddenly it gets solved like a couple months later because every week the hiring manager has to present the numbers and like sort of talk about what experiments they're running um but yes no I'm not going to sugarcoat it it to be data driven right is to you do need good data good sufficiently good data hygiene and it could just be your sales person um sits down and every Sunday night just like the peon in Amazon and goes through the CRM and the deals look chases down each salesperson by calling them or whatever until they get a message that hey you know I need to input this otherwise like you know uh Bob's gonna dock my pay um but this is no different actually from the hygiene necessary to set up customer calls uh and all the work necessary to to have a repeatable process to always talk to customers after like period of time like a periodic end period of like whatever weeks or months right so so yes uh but the rewards I think I think most people don't put in the amount of work because they don't actually think they can get that much out of their data whereas if I if I give you like hey here's how here's what we're going to do the the the goal at the end of this process is as if not more than reaching out to customers and talking to them and once they see that then they're going to become like okay like let's let's do this like it's not that pain not not that much more painful in order to like get things discover things gain knowledge that we can then increase Revenue when you increase I'll pay and get promoted so on so forth is it common as you started to grow an organization that has this as a value is it common to have like a couple of data nerds that are in the data department and they're they're the ones kind of pulling all this together or is this a we are intentionally hiring people that value you know I'm hiring a VP of marketing that values this just as as much and makes decisions I I think it's it's kind of cliche to say that your company is data driven so even just saying that if it's the latter if it's that we hire you know VP Marketing vpa sales ETA that has this appreciation for data and makes decisions around this process control and um in this process you're describing that how do you like attract them how you is it is it a departmental thing or is it a disperse throughout the organization and then if it's the latter how do we attract them into our world without saying we're data driven um so the only way this works is if the executive team the leadership buys into this right and then uh uh what happens is that if if the CEO buys into this so the problem with everything that I've written everything I've just told you is that you can't actually implement this I don't think you can really implement this as a middle manager you have to be an executive the entire executive team has to buy in and then what's going to happen is that there's going to be a virtual cycle where people come in and then they realize that the only way to get things done is to justify things using this sort of worldview they are subject to the process control world viw because they are subject to present in the wbr every week every Wednesday morning right they are going to very quickly realize that they have to fit to this culture this operating Cadence or they're going to drop out and this is not theoretical like there is a famous book uh about uh Ellen mul the CEO of Ford who came into Ford and basically implemented something like the wbr he's a manufacturing guy he was from Boeing right he he he shipped uh I can't remember which Boeing project it was but he shipped it on time and very profitably and safely right people now are saying that Alan malali should go back to Boeing but he came in at the CEO of Ford right and then he subjected his entire extremely political executive team the board thought that he wouldn't survive the board thought that the the existing political culture would chew him out and kick him out right he came in he implemented the WB within months the people who who were too political and not competent selected themselves out um so this is a natural process if you subject them to something like the wbr right and say look where's your numbers or like not not look not where's your numbers but what are you doing to discover the control levers that you have for your numbers that you care about every week you ask right very very quickly Executives will get the the clue like get a clue like hey I need to operate like this or I need to get out yeah um and and you can advertise data driven or not um I I don't think Amazon actually advertises the tri but you know like if you have this operating Cadence every Wednesday you have to sort of talk about what you're doing to discover new control of wi metrics I I don't see how you can survive yeah it's funny like I remember I had that moment the first business that I ran is outside of SAS Academy the first business I ran with Dan Martell and we were on a meeting and you know like like we don't run the wbr the way you're talking about but we I think we've solved in our Cadence a lot of the behavioral elements of it right like we we do a we do a Mondays and Tuesdays um for the Departments and leadership team but we have a standardized reporting period we look at all the metrics every single week so on and so forth but but I remember I got my like behavioral shock when I was on a a call doing a scorecard review with Dan and there was like I don't know it was out of maybe 40 or 50 rows of data we were looking at there were like two that were missing a value and he brought the whole meeting to a stop they weren't even consequential we read the whole meeting to a stop he's like I don't understand are we having this meeting or not and everyone's like what are you talking about he's like well scorecard is not filled out like we're missing these two things like did you guys are did you guys meet and he just let it get weird and it was like this beautifully executed awkward pause that completely made the problem go away forever right because nobody wanted to have that experience of the guy running the show put the breaks on a 10-person meeting because there were two rows missing on a scorecard it was just like this behavioral way to reinforce the fact that like look we fill it out or we don't like we don't fill out parts of it when we want to like this is the way that we work we put our numbers in we color code them and we talk about them if they're not on track like it's just it's not optional it's just a standard and it's funny that that moment in that meeting in a different company still lives in my head right because it's like you can't can't halfway fill out a scorecard you can't get some of the data and expect to make all the decisions right you either it's a zero or a one I think at the end of the day and that's the the cultural shift that I remember remember going back a couple of years you know that I've tried to carry with me is you either do it or you don't it's a good metaphor for a lot of things in life um in the original wbi when they had to manually submit Excel sheets into a shared workspace the macro was written so that if you did not submit your Excel sheet on Sunday night when the peon was gen I keep saying peon it's not peon it's like the analyst the analyst was generating the wbr they would not show the graph with the data point missing they would just say X data was not submitted o and can you imagine being in the same room with Jeff Bezos when he sees that he's gonna scream at you yeah right so like yeah 100% yeah you just gotta let it get weird so I'm I'm probably somewhere in the middle of uh intuition and data driven decision making and I love these these metrics that summarize they're kind of the rollup metrics they're the they're the um like the rule of 40 is a really good example in SAS of like this summation that says investigate or not it's a proxy for a bunch of different inputs you're probably not going to make a single decision on these I don't even there's probably a a a a more there's probably a definition to this type of metric are there other ones what are the ones you've been playing this data game for a long time like what are some of the summary metrics like the rule of 40 that um like to uh to use if you were to give now I love you'd have I know that you'd love to have 400 to 500 rows but if I only gave you five and you still had to create the same outcomes I'm curious like what are the five metrics you're picking this holy [ __ ] um so see Cedric this is what I deal with every day no no no no no so so summary metrics are a bad idea because business yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so this this is actually a controversial bit like uh uh Colin made it very clear to me like at Amazon they do not believe in summary metrics summary metrics yes summary metrics can tell you what to investigate but by the time they tell you what to investigate right it's too late Why not pick up the problem much earlier using controllable input metrics or or like some Metric that more accurately can capture the problem right um and then you go stop that problem from happening because operational excellence is not waking three months when you could just stop it today right so there is this is an ongoing debate to be fair like there's this whole Northstar metric framework that everybody likes to talk about that you know like Amazon thingss to [ __ ] uh reforge I don't know if you know who reforge is yeah they they they have an an essay actually uh that basically a no star metric framework is considered harmful um because because your business is complex your business is complex and therefore you your matrics need to reflect the reality of your complex business I give you two examples of this one is um one way that you add new controllable input Matrix or new metrix to your WB so w WB is not a static thing you're adding and removing things as you're discovering new control levers because sometimes also control levers stop being predictive they stop being you driving you continue to draw drive out the controllable input metric but the output metric you care about is no longer budging uh the relationship has sort of like broken down due to like a variety of factors because business is constantly changing right um so one question that you always ask that that Colin made very clear to me on when to add a new controllable inut metric is if a blowup happens then you need to ask yourself what metric could we have been tracking that would have alerted us to this and prevented the blowup from happening in the future and then you after you answer that you add that to the wbr and you don't take it out because it's an early it's there for a very specific purpose which is an early warning signal for that particular kind of blowup right um uh second there's got to be some type of relationship at some point there is a there's a utility for like I I'll say like in a in a company all hands right when I'm trying to craft The Narrative of how what happened last month last quarter or if I'm trying to report out to investors where there's a certain level of fidelity needed and if that that Fidelity is either going to get you to lean in or be like perfect no additional no information needed we we got what we expected I think that there is a place if you're like I Merit to Ay if I'm making decisions that drive action even to your point earlier on believability like when we're taking in content to then go take action there's a higher threshold versus when am I using this to either hey I've got to edit my perspective and I don't know what two but I know that my current one is off base or nope this is the reality I expect you to see is the reality we're experiencing so like there is a for some of the summary metrics I'm Cur I'm curious if you agree um I think that the world operates in a way where we need them um and I'd be curious like which ones which five you'd pick sorry just just to to to you said something very very true and very interesting there which is that there is a middle place in which you communicate um a causal model of the business right so so why do you want just five metric you want it because it's it's easier to communicate to a large group of people right yes yes operationally you're looking at 500 metric but you you want something that can communicate to a large body of people here's how we make the business grow and and I and one way of thinking about is yes you can distill it down to five uh metrics um Amazon didn't distill it down to five metrics they distilled it down to a flywheel do you remember the flywheel like I so I thought that the fly wheel was this communication device right u in the early days so I learned Colin disabused me of this notion quite quickly in the early days the Flyway was more than just like a it was a coordinating causal model of the business every metrix should tie to selection convenience or uh selection what it price selection and convenience right so every matric should tie to one of these tree or enable this tree if you're like you know data infrastructure you keep the site running or site infrastructure um the CM model was the thing that was was communicated and so like if you proposing some new feature or some new initiative right you need to sort of argue why it ties into one of these three factors in the causal model of the business the flywheel um and so the first step that reforge does is to get all the executives in the room and ask them to draw the growth Loop of how they think the company grows and it usually there's disagreements right um so the first step of doing the wbr actually is also to draw the flight view right you draw how do you believe your company grows and then you hash it out Executives will probably disagree marketing might have a different view from sales at the end of it you have a causal Loop that you can then communicate to the rest of the company and then the rest of the company are now enabled to go and seek out metric that best capture the expression of that Loop for their particular contacts right and so it's the it's the loop that you communicate not necessarily metrics the reason it's dangerous is because um uh why at the end of the day why do we want knowledge we want knowledge not truth because in business there is no such thing as truth this is a daming thing like we think in in in in school educ we are educated to believe that there are certain truths about the world and that those truths don't change but that is not true about business in business things that you believe is true about your business will change and the only way that you know that it would change is if the data changes the data tells you so that made it very clear that like in business there is no such thing as truth there is only knowledge and the only thing that matters is predictive validity like the only thing that makes knowledge knowledge is that does it actually predict the outcomes that you think will happen right because if things change then you need to know and you need to change the way that you think about your business so just sticking to five metrics um makes it makes you makes it dangerous because the world may change around you and in terms of those five metrics actually don't capture but what truly matters in your business whereas if you communicate a causal model people will start going like hey I don't think this causal model is Right anymore because the numbers don't seem to make sense well I I I can appreciate from an operator's perspective like where you're coming from from I think that there is a you know I don't know maybe you'll write a blog post on this over the next 12 months you you'll lean into this and uh and come out on on the other side there's a there's you have to meet people where they're at right and so if you have an executive team or uh even an investor or a third party where you are trying to enroll them in the process of the company's flywheel and the input metrics that drive those outcomes you can't just go straight into the weekly Business Review with 500 developing the feel if you will is is a process over time and I think that even even at the founders and teams listening to this call they can't get to the 500 moment overnight but if I had zero metrics that I was looking at and I developed five that helped tell part of the story and then over the next three months I discovered even more gaps it's almost like this is the dial of um going from not data driven to very data driven it's it's how are we getting there I'm curious Matt you've you've dealt with several like zero to ones yeah and then ones to tens in this like how do you think about summary metrics and becoming more data driven over time so I think it's actually an end not an or and here's what I mean like the if I were to picture like a mental model for this it's kind of a like a Continuum and so on one side of the Continuum I would say I have High context high granularity and like tightly scoped metrics right so the if we're close to the business then it's a higher number of metrics because you have the context to make sense I could break down our sales funnel into a 100 data points and put it in front of Johnny pagee and you would know what all 100 of them are I could put that in front of somebody on our Advisory Board and they'd be like cool story I'm not reading all that [ __ ] like what are you trying to communicate with me right so I think High context tightly scoped metrics let you go up in granularity and the thing that's on that side of the Continuum is forward-looking meaning like I'm trying to get the most leading indicators that I can get in order to help me affect the change very very quickly the other side of the Continuum low context right we're generally Looking In Reverse not talking about how do I change what happens in two weeks but what did happen over the past month or the past quarter and at that point it's a lower number of metrics that are more aggregated right where I can look at something like a net operating income percentage or a year-over-year revenue growth or a rule of 40 or whatever because I could talk to them about the fact that I got a a substack backlink that drove this that drove that you know what I'm saying that and they might be like cool but like what does this actually mean and I'd be like well it means that you know Revenue went up 4% when I was only forecasting go up 2% because we did marketing [ __ ] and figured something out and so I think it's almost like matching the way that I communicate to the audience because I've done this wrong a number of times where I'll go to someone who's a low context person right or in a low context environment and I'll be talking about all sorts of crazy [ __ ] and they're like dude I don't care about anything you're saying like just give me the bullet point but at the same time we'll do the business a total disservice if we go to the team that's operating it and put the rule of 40 in front of and be like hey make that better we're freaking doomed right so I think it's just this Continuum of like the right scope the right level of context the right granularity for the right person I think both can be true it's true oh I see now what you're saying Johnny like if you're communicating to an external stakeholder an advisor you can give them your wbr that's crazy yeah okay five metrics well it's somewhat easy right because you're only dealing with SAS companies and it's like SAS is almost like they're all the same under the hood right there cagt software tastes like chicken man right yes right I mean Vista Equity partners and constellation software themselves they they track a very small number of metrics um so I can't remember what it was but I if I was interested in sort of like what's going on I would be interested in CAC LTV uh the CAC LTV ratio I would have I I want some Metric that captures the cash flow because the SAS is incredibly cash consumptive and you're growing um so I want some Metric that summarized the cash uh position because uh you can easily run out of cash when you're growing um and then I W some measure of R&amp;D span right uh because uh you know like one of the most expensive things when you're building assas is your your your software engineers maybe R&amp;D is not that great because it's kind of like a extremely leading indicator if I'm a if I'm a investor and I want a financial metrics um then what do you guys usually look at that's not CAC LTB yeah there's two things I'd say on it I I don't love cacta LTV is and again so for the context we work with like usually seven out of 10 of our Founders are bootstrap so we're we're talking more about bootstrap cashing SAS versus VCB hypergrowth SAS right and so that context we focus a lot on definitely CAC but then CAC payback period right so they actually see what the cash conversion cycle is because especially if you've only had a business for 18 to 24 months sure you can back into an LTV dividing by churn but it's actually swings wildly it's not that useful right exactly so so I like get CAC CAC payback period net revenue retention those are like my my big three agree for sure on cash position and then overall Revenue growth like I think it um those and honestly the other one that I think for sales L businesses is really important not just for sales team performance but because it gives me a lot of insights on pricing is actually their win rate again can't have shitty CRM hygiene to do it but I yes I can say you might have a sales problem if you're only closing 10% of your deals but the the the conversations I love having are with Founders who are so stoked and they're like I'm closing 80% of my deals I'm like great double your prices you're literally lighting money on fire right now like if closing eight out of 10 deals you're not charging enough and that can change their whole business so I love at least a single like bottom of funnel sales Le metric just so I can see if they're honestly if they're closing too many deals because like pricing is one of the most potent levers we've got to grow SAS companies and it's a beautiful correlation I found anecdotally but a beautiful correlation between if your close rate is like Bonkers then you're likely just have some type of like identity issue or self-confidence issue that's stopping you from pricing your software what it's actually worth so yeah those would be mine beautiful I love it I love it um Cedric I had a question from a client the other day that I'd love your opinion on they had a a quarterly initiative to improve their win rate and they asked me their sales Cycles are 60 days or longer so in a given quarter they may only close you know a third of their deals will open and close in that in that process if they're lucky and they said how can I recognize I'm making progress in this area well how would you instrument the weekly business reviews to be seeing the improvements to win rate um for longer Sal Cycles this one so there's so when when you define this is the controllable input metric we're driving and we hypothesized that this is going to affect the output metric the you have to sort of say how long you expect the change to show up and and this tells me like based on the situation you just described right the the change can take a year to show up I think um uh the other sort of constraint here is that if you're using an XMR chart you need at least six new data points after the change uh to sort of show you at least but of course not limited to it's not the minimum sorry it is the minimum but it's your change may take longer to show up right um so this is a major problem and there's no there's no way around it um uh when Amazon what would you look like what would you look at if you're every Wednesday you're getting together and there's activity each week happening like take this for this is for the non- DAT driven company right now very intuitive if they're going to take a couple steps towards being more data driven for this project specifically what do you start to say let's be tracking these things and look we can we can pow out on This Together Matt love to get your perspective on it as well it's like this is the win rate is not going to move minimum if they start making changes today tomorrow like they have very few uh deals that will open within the next two months and then close so they're minimum two two months away from the lagging indicator catching up how could they instrument the weekly meeting about this objective to get a sense for are we progressing in the right direction I just like to take the theory that you've taught on here and and put it in a practical application this is one that I know many many of our founders focus on when they're trying to improve win rate like um you know Matt just discussed you know they're at 20% they're trying to get to 25 or 30% what do they look at on a weekly basis to know are we making progress so if you have a process change in your sales process right it could be what would be an example of a sales process that you can track uh process change to increase win rate could it be like new sales enablement material uh could it be a different way of qualif let's go let's go with teaching our 92 um pitch from April dunford's um positioning canvas right we think we've got this messaging in we're going to insert this into our sales process but you're on a 60-day sales cycle right so in that in that case the thing that I would track right is uh testing the sales people on their pitch because like dunf herself says that you need to make sure that your sales reps are actually delivering the pitch that you've taught them to and the way they do that is they build it into training so they every X months or so you go test them and see like if or you you go on a you you review the calls um use gong or something if it's a recorded call and then you you sort of say what's the percentage uh that they're actually delivering this uh uh properly and you have to pre-register like what's the definition of is this a good delivery or not so you have to like say beforehand what your metric is how do you measure right and then you just sort of look to see like is the percentage like high enough like ideally is every salesperson delivers every call in the way that you expect it to of course it might take a couple weeks for this to actually happen um and then you just hold that input metric and then you wait the the pre-registered time that you've said would take for this to show up and bear in mind Amazon waited two years for the output metrics for Prime to show up so there were three output metrics for Amazon Prime it was uh number of items per order number of orders per year and number of sorry number of items per order number of items orders per customer and the number of items per customer per year and at the time when they introduce Amazon Prime the most active customers of Amazon only bought a couple of times a year because was the early 2000s right so they waited two years because they knew that would be how long it would take for it to show up given that the most active most passionate customers only bought a few times a year um and they were patient to do it I asked like how C how could you wait two years and then Colin laughed back at me in said that you know if you think longterm two years is not very long in the grand scheme of things right so can you wait eight months three months I think it's possible right because there will be other things that you will be driving as well you're just making sure that this process change stays discipline you stay on this new process and then you wait for the number to change I gotta I want to double click on something you just said because my mouth literally fell open for a second because I was just laughing to myself and I just have to say this out loud so few companies like an operators myself included I don't know if we would think to install a tracking mechanism on just are the Reps doing the updated pitch the right way what 99 out of 100 companies will do is they'll say I it's going to take me six months to I'm going to guess it take me six months to see this in my close rates and then they wait six months and then the number moves or it doesn't but especially if it doesn't move you then you're like why didn't this move it's been six months and you have no idea if the thing that you even designed has gotten delivered and you've burned half a year at that point right so I think there's actually a foundational question here which is we spend a lot of times as product people as sales leaders as you know people who own Revenue whatever building these systems on mirror boards and in our brains and whatever about like it should work this way I should deliver this result in five days and that result in five days and I should say this way and I should read that script and we go right to how long should it take it for the results to show up and don't spend the time instrumenting are the people actually doing the [ __ ] that I built the right way so I can even see if my thing is working I just wonder how many times we've not gotten a result and then said that our hypothesis was wrong where really we had the right strategy but poor execution and we just weren't set up to even know that in the freaking first place and that's just like a a big idea where it's like if you have a time delay to the to the output metric changing at least instrument to make sure it's getting executed properly because if it's not getting executed properly you're not even playing the game and you could burn six months before you even realize it or burn six months and never realize it I just think that's like that's a big idea for a lot of people for me incl yeah you and you don't have to instrument every call you can pick an idea from manufacturing which is you randomly sample if you have a very large Salesforce you can just randomly sample and say okay here uh you Joe like give me the pitch now or walk me through a sales code we're going to do a full sales call I'm gonna act as a client now right and you do this randomly every week just randomly pick a salesp person and then from there from there's easy simple sampling mathematics that you can do just Google for like a formula and you can immediately sort of scale up from that sample right like how what percentage of your large salesource is actually delivering this pitch yeah and it's funny because it ties back to one of the when I read um working backwards one of the things that stuck with me was in that chapter about the wbr they said there's essentially three questions that it's designed to answer and I'm going to say them out of order because I'm going to put them as like what I think are obvious and then leave the non-obvious one at the end right so it is designed to answer how did the business do right over the prior week it's designed to answer are we tracking to our goals and I think most businesses are reasonably good at that but then the one that they put at the top which deserves a seat at the top is what did our customer experience in the business last week and just as much as you could say that from a product standpoint for a SAS application or from a you know was the widget in stock on Amazon's website you know blah blah blah blah blah the example we just said is just as important right essentially like did my future customer experienced the sales process the way that they were supposed to and so I think that instrumenting for experience experience is arguably more important than instrumenting for results because the experience is what drives the results but I think most businesses are really good or at least moderately good at figuring out how they did looking in and not necessarily what did their customers experience looking out and I think that that was one of the biggest takeaways I got from the book um was just that experience that we have to put as much muscle into instrumenting our customer experience as we do our business performance yep which I thought was fascinating um cedra so we're coming up on time and I want to I want to ask you one kind of question to help land the plane here um I have about 11,000 that I can choose from but I think the the right question to leave this with is the right question to leave it with is this if you're a founder and you've listened to all of this this entire first off congratulations you're a nerd if anyone's made it this far in this podcast I love you call me um right if you've if you've listened to all of this and you're still not sure right like not sure what the first step is not sure how to take an XMR chart and get it in front of my team or not sure how to get the the cultural thing jump started right like no one gives a [ __ ] about data I'm going to run this on my gut feel like I'm G ask you a question you probably hate but if you had to distill this into one like what's the right first move right first out the gate right you're an executive you're running this company what's the one action that you can take we're recording this on April 24th on May 1st right what's the one thing you can take to just start looking at your data one degree smarter than you were last week like how do you begin if you do nothing else how do you begin I would ask you to sit them and draw a growth Loop fly like you talked about with Amazon right yes re reforge took that and they teach an entire program about growth Loops right which is that every company grows through some kind of growth Loop and most SAS companies grow through a cash growth Loop which is that you make a sale they can pay you money that money can be used to fund more operations marketing that then gets a sale that gives you cash there are two other kinds of growth Loops that reforge talks about in fact there's only three kinds it's like there's a viral growth Loop which probably doesn't apply to most s um and there is a um they call the content the user generate the content Loop which is that your customers come in and then they generate some incidental content like pin Pinterest right and that content gets ranked on Google and then they bring in more customers right so so there are three kinds of loop but most SAS companies are U the C growth Loop and some s companies Dropbox slack have the viral growth Loop so draw out on a whiteboard or a piece of paper what your growth Loop is right what so common C's growth Loop is I produce content I write essays um those essays get traffic from four different sources uh those some number of those four different sources will turn into new stter subscribers or they'll become repeat meters and then I will convert some measure of those two repeat readers versus newsletter subscribers into paying members which pays my bills which causes me to eat and then I can continue writing and then so I'm trying to I'm trying to express like how stupid and dumb this is everybody can do this right for any business if you're a laminate stand you can also draw a growth Loop yeah right um so this is super easy just write it down right and then maybe if you have Executives you can show this to them and they'll suggest like modifications to the go it's okay and then when you look at it right just ask yourself what are the output metrics that you care about and I tell you this is the easiest part right everybody you look at all the steps on the grow Loop right like number of articles I produce per week number of traffic for each of the traffic sources the output metric how many visitors for each of these channels that I I get right and then like how many people turn into repeat readers these are all obvious things and maybe you can't measure them immedi immediately it's okay because you you are starting now to gain knowledge about what you think how you think your business distance grows right and then after that you start measuring it you start putting it up on some kind of dashboard that you look at every week and you talk about right and then comes the difficult part which is that you need to figure out for each of these steps in your growth Loop in your flywheel what is a controllable input metric and you're probably going to get it wrong you're probably going to incentivize the wrong Behavior it's okay it's fine right uh the whole point is to slowly gain knowledge about like how your business actually works uh and it can be a very long process it can take you multiple years to ease into this but just the act of looking at a bunch of numbers tied to a growth Loop that you draw out on a whiteboard or a piece of paper or a mirror board somewhere right allows you to start building towards uncovering more and more about your business and that's how we started everybody in my team knows what the growth Loop is we now know actually that the initial growth Loop that I drew was wrong Hacker News is no longer as large a traffic channel um as it used to be when I first drew it for me um and we also learned that newsletters are newsletter subscribers isn't as big a path like there are lots of repeat readers who eventually then become members but this was learned to try and error through like talking to customers and measuring things and getting things wrong um and then like just every week looking at the numbers and saying hey like what can we change what can we what can we do they will make a change they will tell us a bit more about whether this growth Loop is real or not right that I think you yeah you planted a really great idea that I would love to leave everyone with which is and tell me if you if you don't agree that this is a summary but I think that the biggest principle I'm taking from you on all of the processes you've laid out is that the goal isn't to be right at least not at first the goal is to just be better you know and it's a it seems like a very iterative process where it's not about draw the growth Loop and you better freaking get it right it's draw what you think it is measure one thing at each stage figure out one way you think you might change those one things and just start twisting a couple of knobs and figure out which pieces are wrong and which ones are right and as long as you're getting more right over time you're doing the thing yeah it's not about just you have to be correct out the gate because that's probably a fallacy yeah yep 100% and you're going to do so much better than all your competitors because they likely don't actually understand how their business Works whereas over time you understand how your business actually works more and more a little bit each week I love it man I think that's a great place to leave it John any final thoughts for uh for Cedric no this is awesome I'm glad there is uh Matt's got some companions out there in the world listen I appreciate the Matts and the Cedric of the world who who's brain thinks this way um and uh I think uh Matt owes you A big one I messaged him I said hey man you sold on the process like we got to go implement this now so yeah that's actually how you implement behavioral change in your company you start a podcast and bring on really smart people and then you talk about the stuff you want to talk about perfect yeah I love it Cedric thank you for being so generous with your time man I've Loved collaborating with you over email and loved chopping it up with you on the Pod man so thanks so much for being with us man thank you so much for having me on oh I should talk oh yeah and how do people read more sorry how do people read more I want to know everything tell tell the people give them what they want you can read so I highly recommend just reading that one article because I I put in the show notes for sure yeah I tried to compress everything into one article because it was like it's if I want to write about the wbi you need to understand like these basic ideas that enable you to to do the WB right so it's becoming data driven from first principles my blog is common.com and we release a free tool that allows you to quickly create XMR charts and play with metrics uh because we want to spread it and we I just we just open source it yesterday because we want you to steal it we want you to take the code and build it into your tools and host it on your own service if you don't trust Zam which is the the the the site that we we set up you don't trust putting your data on outside it's fine just go take the tool and bring it into your company and use it at the very least to tell you which data point should you not investigate and which data point should you investigate right so z.com XM RIT t.com that's the free tool that's a free course there as well um we're selling a a paid course to sort of justify the cost of developing the tool and continuing continue to maintain it um common call.com just read that one article and I think uh just just get started like you once you once you feel once your team starts to feel hey I actually understand how this business Works end to end I tell you it's nothing in the world it's a rush I've had teammates say to me right it's made me forever salty about working anywhere else I actually understand a business and how it works end to end I know what levers exist and I know a method that I can use to discover new levers so go go and win I love it I love it yeah that's solid I'll put all of those links in the show notes um yes everyone should read everything on common Cog everybody who's interested in this should become paid members and I don't say that because you're on the podcast I say that because you you're crushing your writing is top-notch man and I appreciate you taking the time that it takes to put that stuff out into the world so thank you brother thank you awesome Cedric I enjoy man talk soon cool thanks for coming on [Music]
