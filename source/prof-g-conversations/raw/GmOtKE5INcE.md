most of the businesses are kind of a a a carefully concealed series of disasters and they don't have a road map for you to actually see what you're buying and so because of that I could scream about this from the rooftops but if people don't actually know how to get inside of a business hold the hand of a business owner that's done paper invoices for seven years and move them into 21st century Tech they're probably not going to close that sale and so I think we we still have a lot of of Runway to go there plus this is such a it's the perfect fragmented Market I mean most of these small businesses are probably jobs but guess who wants a job your 30-year-olds who are making less than their parents were at 30 as you've talked about before they'd be thrilled with a business where they could raise their prices more than inflation each year where they could be their own boss and where they might actually be able to grow the business [Music] overall Cody where does this podcast find you Austin Texas actually nice let's bust right into it you have a book coming out in early December titled Main Street millionaire how to make a extraordinary wealth buying ordinary businesses in your book you share your journey to building a ninef figure portfolio so first what is your definition of Rich well I think mostly rich I think of as Freedom so it's can you push back on the world and live the life you want to live uh you know this all too well but as you start making money there's always a bigger number that sounds more interesting but I think the biggest thing is that you kind of get to do what you want to do to some degree and life still sucks and it's hard in many ways but uh it sucks a lot less when you have a bank account that allows you to kind of work where you want live where you want to and build what you want to and so I kind of have the words rich and and more free as synonymous yeah you you introduced this something called the rich method can you break it down for us yeah well the idea is basically four segments of the book so first thing is research so a lot of people when they think about buying a business they hear the idea then they go think well I'll go buy a business and I'm like yeses you could actually really lose money uh buying a business or doing deals or investing if you do it wrong and so the first part is can you spend a little bit of time actually breaking down what it takes to buy a business we think there are like 10 steps to buy in a business so that first uh rich is a big component of doing your due diligence and understanding what that even means to figuring out what a deal might be good for you not just a good deal overall and then you know next we like to break in to into the eye which is invest so now that you kind of understand what you're doing how can you um start allocating a little bit of either risk so like your time maybe your expertise or Capital Money In order to do a deal so I also don't think you can spell rich without risk in some way shape or form whether it's your time or somebody else's um and then C is for command so the idea is that your first deal probably will not be your best deal in the same way that your first job is hopefully not your last job you're going to get better at it you're going to do bigger ones you're going to understand what investing is good for you one way or the other and then finally we want to take it to the next level which is how can you actually scale in a significant way maybe that looks like a holding company um maybe that looks like you doing additional deals inside of your main business you know I saw when I was on Wall Street most of the money made by Finance professionals is not actually coming up with brilliant startup ideas you know that's all too well you know 90% of them fail but I think the other part we don't talk about is that the average income of an entrepreneur that did a startup is like 47 to $67,000 a year 3 to four years in so it's like you lose money you pay for the right to lose money multiple years in a startup and then most people don't really make more than you would if you were in a corporate job and the very very few make an absurd amount of money but it's actually quite hard and so um I kind of obsess on this idea of what if we just focused on profitable businesses instead and what if when we had our brilliant business ideaa instead of just going out and starting it unless we want to start the next you know Facebook we can't sleep for the want of the company being in the world then I think instead we should probably start with a nice little profitable business and then maybe acquire a few others on top of it and so we can actually buy other people's 10,000 hours as opposed to having to slave away for them for decades ourselves doesn't a lot of it so I'm that person that started a bunch of businesses cuz I didn't know how to buy a business so I started a bunch and you're right it's just it's just riskier the upside I think the few times or the couple times I got I got it right I probably made more than someone who bought a similar business U but I also just took more risk and I had some zeros and it's unlikely I would have got you know had zeros if I just come into companies that were already working and bought them doesn't it come down to similar to the housing market it's all about the price you buy at and that is buying a good business at a decent price you make money but if you at some price if the market gets crazy and everyone reads your book and starts crawling all over the country for small businesses as some private Equity firms are doing that it becomes too expensive don't you really need to kind of figure out and this is I guess part of your R research what you should be paying for this type of business yeah I mean I had a a mentor of mine that told me a line I really liked that I've remembered for years which is you can have my price and your terms or your terms and my price but you can't have both and that Pros want to actually control the terms not the price and so I think you're right at the at the base level which is it's really hard to work your way out of a bad deal done UPF front um but more than obsessing on price I would obsess on the terms like I could give you a million bucks for a business that only does $10,000 in annual revenue if I got to pay it over the next 40 years out of future profits as long as I got to keep I don't know 5,000 bucks a month so one of the things I'm hoping that we can teach people is like real estate's funny because it's been so commoditized now you can't do a lot of term changes to it right you're not like seller finance me that house that's pretty hard to talk to somebody into you know you're not going to ask them to change the mortgage terms to go out you know a crazy different amount you're not going to say well if I find X can I have a little bit of capital I can hold back in case we did the valuation wrong up front you can't really do any of that in real estate anymore um I'm sure eventually businesses will be able to do less of it but um businesses just have so many levers that I think the real goal here is can you control the terms so that you know what you think you're buying like base level yes you need to know what a business valuation should be but I think the real problem is you get into a business you're like hey this guy's been running it for 30 years I'm going to buy it for a million bucks and um I think the business makes enough money in order for it to be worth a million bucks and you quickly realize you've never run a business before and so you're probably not going to do as well as the guy immediately out the gate and then you run out of cash and so my biggest protection is always how can we even pay a little bit more for something I'm okay with the premium as long as it's overtime and we decrease our Risk by how we structure the deal one of the things we really enjoyed about your book is you're focus on investing in what you call Main Street businesses Industries including Plumbing construction cleaning and electrical services this is something we talk about a lot on the Pod how the skilled trades are often overlooked what makes these unsexy business business is so reliable for wealth building yeah well I that's when I really like wanted to reach out to you originally was because you have seen all sides of the trade you've been a public market guy forever you've also been inside the university system you know you've also seen inside of even private entities or some companies maybe want to take private from public you've kind of seen the full gamut of what a company can do and I've been sort of yelling at the internet for the past four years about the fact that during the 1800s uh American ownership was uh 80% most Americans own their own business this uh time around we're happy if 10% of Americans own their own business in fact it's about 6% of Americans own their own business and you know how you know we're losing is that the Canadians have more ownership than we do they have like 7.8% ownership and so my theory here is that ownership leads to wealth most often if that ownership is sustainable and I think we have this like Crisis where we have a bunch of young people today having 452 llc's that make no money and so we have a lot of like quote unquote company creation especially since 2020 but they don't make any money you know 60% of all small businesses listed are single proprietorships with no employees and so um why I like Main Street businesses are if you've been a landscaping company for 10 years you've been in existence you never got funding from somebody to run your business you never got BC Capital that thing had to make money by itself year after year in order for you to fund your salary and so these Main Street businesses never benefited from this huge glut of capital that came from venture capital and even private Equity firms they take the company entirely so if if they if they value a company incorrectly it doesn't hurt like the individual it hurts their investors and I think they've gotten a bad rap but they also are the thing that builds local communities and I'd way rather some Corner coffee shops and local landscaping than a Starbucks or a PE owned rollup on the Diary of a CEO you listed three businesses that you really like right now Senior Care Centers businesses that are services-based that don't require a lot of up Capital including window cleaning pressure washing and painting businesses and the third being what you call gateway drug businesses what did you mean by that yeah so gateway drug businesses or the business that allows you to get a little taste of what the addictive game of business is which is running a p&amp;l making money being your own boss it's awful but it's also amazing once you've done it and so gateway drug business would be a thing like what is typically called like a self-served car wash so they're not super expensive you don't have a ton of employees it's not a complex business to understand and thus you might be able to start with something like that mine famously was a laundromat that was my idea when I first started buying businesses I was like man I've been a corra junky for so long I don't know if I could run a business by myself this one's pretty simple I could probably run this one it's like dirty clothes go into a machine get clean I take a quarter I make money on it that makes sense to me there's not that many levers to the business and so um you know a lot of these are called people light or Capital light businesses so not that many employees not that much operating expense these are the type of businesses that I think are interesting for people to get their hands a little bit dirty on the game of business to start and the only caveat there is we've seen a huge increase in the multiple cost of these business since we've started talking about that both laundry mats and car washes so you know keep your eye on the prize that you do pay the r right price in terms yeah that makes sense and then also you talk about or I think it's in your book but we talk a lot about here about this silver tsunami and that is with so many baby boomers retiring there's a huge opportunity for younger generations to acquire these businesses what are some signs that a small business is ideal for acquisition how how can what are some rules of the road for what feels like a good business in your view I have two methodologies if you're going to buy a business first thing is we buy realities and profits we don't buy hopes and dreams so I think where you can go really wrong in buying a small business is that you go and buy a business that's losing money today and you go the thing is I can fix it and I always compare this to real estate like how many times have you redone a house and it's under budget and done quicker than you thought it was the answer is like never it's just physics or something and so just make sure that you don't buy turnaround businesses I think that's for pros if you're a pro you could do a turnaround but you've done some of those publicly man they're brutal and litigious and so stay away from that um the the second thing that makes a business really interesting to me I think is that you have an owner of the business who's been around for a long time it has a managerial layer so there's it's not just a job it's a business there are other people running varying divisions of the business it's profitable the business is usually in a recession resistant sector like for instance you know it doesn't mean that it can't go down but you might have a a plumbing business you might have a roofing business you might have a landscaping business you know these aren't so luxurious of items that you're going to die during a recession as opposed to like a Custom Framing business which you know maybe is not the best business to get into with volatility and then the last thing that I think is interesting for these small businesses like you really got to make sure that you don't get in over your head I say so simple grandma could do it and if Grandma doesn't understand your business model then maybe that's not the right business for you people have been talking about this for a while that there are a lot of mainstream businesses coming up for sale and there's a bit of a asymmetric or dislocation what do I mean by that that young people find these businesses not sexy and there's a lot of baby boomers whose kids don't want to inherit the business a dad has a carpet cleaning business and makes good money he wants to retire and he can't find anyone and there's not a real liquid Market here is this Market getting more liquid have you seen you you reference valuations have gone up you still feel there's a lot of opportunity yeah well now we have some unique data on this market so we bought a a website called bis Scout which is a Marketplace for buying and selling small businesses now we have 68,000 listings on that website we've connected about 3,000 buyers and sellers over the past four weeks and we're starting to get sort of our first realm of proprietary data which is it's a real [ __ ] to get data in the small business space you know you can go to the SBA they won't really release any information from you there's a couple Behemoth in the industry They Don't Really share third party and so what we found from the 58,000 businesses listed is most of them are highly incomplete so we have this marketplace where it's the opposite of Zillow and redin there's no public list there's no historical listings of pricing there's no uploaded QuickBooks or um you know tax documentation to confirm what the listings have located there very little usage of data room they say that less than 10% of all small businesses that are listed for sale run through a broker so so most of the businesses are kind of a a a carefully concealed series of disasters and they don't have a road map for you to actually see what you're buying and so because of that I could scream about this from the rooftops but if people don't actually know how to get inside of a business hold the hand of a business owner that's done paper invoices for seven years and move them into 21st century Tech they're probably not going to close that sale and so I think we we still have a lot of of Runway to go there plus this is such a it's the perfect fragmented Market I mean most of these small businesses are probably jobs but guess who wants a job your 30-year-olds who are making less than their parents were at 30 as you've talked about before they'd be thrilled with a business where they could raise their prices more than inflation each year where they could be their own boss and where they might actually be able to grow the business overall and so you know businesses that are sub $10 million in Revenue are numerous I mean that would be businesses sub1 million but above 5 million are about 20% of the marketplace and the rest is below $5 million in annual revenue which is a very very small business talk a little bit about financing there's different ways to finance a small business what I would think a lot of people don't consider us because I think I've got 20 30 $50,000 to my name or no Capital how what are different means of financing the acquisition of a small business yeah without trying to sound like a used car salesman saying that you could buy a car with Z doar down and no credit you know the interesting part about the business landscape is the credit is not your own I think a lot of people don't realize this when you go to buy a house you go okay I got $200,000 in earned income they'll loan me whatever based on my earned income and I can't buy a house that's more than that it's all based on how much I earn you go to buy a small business the small business is what the loan is on now they also want to make sure that you are not going to fail and you're not going to sit as like a a liability on their balance sheet cuz you can't run the business but they're really analyzing the business so your earned income is whatever the earned income of the the business makes which is like a huge mindset for people to have to think about now you know we know the SBA uh will do loans up to 90% of the purchase price of a small business so that means you're on the hook for probably 10% to 20% down for a small business and then you know you want to have float right you want to have enough cash on hand to make sure you can handle operating costs for the business overall but you know there's three ways that we buy businesses that people don't think about one Uncle Sam SBA gives you money to buy the business this is just getting expanded for the first time ever they're allowing Diversified investors so you don't have to be the only one you don't even have to put up the 10 or 20% now you can have other people invest alongside you put up the capital and be on the loan with you that's just enacted this year the second way is seller financing or creative financing I don't really like to say seller financing because it kind of sounds weird if you go to the owner of business and say like you sell your business using your future profits which is what it is I might say instead creative financing in the book we have like a couple graphs that I think help make this more reasonable as to why a seller would do this but 60% of all small businesses are sold with some component of seller financing which is a wild number now not 80% but 30% at least and then the third way that we see small businesses getting sold and we're seeing it like crazy in Japan I think it's going to start happening more here in the US is basically we're seeing apprenticeship Begin Again a small business owner knows that they want to retire in the next 5 years and because they want to retire in the next five years they are starting to look for somebody to take over for their small business for them and so it just happened with Jade a member of our community she went to her boss this is the military contracting company and said I want to eventually take over your business uh would you be open to selling to me and instead he said why don't we start transitioning from the business from me to you and I'll continue to take a glorified uh salary really like a royalty payment on what you make over the next 5 10 or 15 years but I don't even need you to actually buy the business from me and so if we don't do this my thought is that a bunch of these businesses go away and they die and we've seen that happen and so that is why I'm pushing people to say yes be careful of risk but these businesses are available all around you to purchase and Baby Boomers simply will not live forever and if we don't buy them then those businesses will go away entirely so say you're sold on this what's the best way to try and cast a wide net and identify these businesses I wouldn't even know where to start to try and find these businesses well I think the first thing you got to do is we call it deal Clarity so um you got to really make sure you know what you want in a business I think a lot of reasons why people get overwhelmed in searching is because they're like okay I'm going to buy a business I guess Cody talked about laund Mount so I'm going to buy a laund amount and that's not actually right we call it a per perfect fit business so imagine kind of like you know three Circles of end diagram in the middle is the business that's perfect for you what I usually tell people today is like all everybody listening has some sort of skill set that that is unique to them if you're an accountant yes you could go buy a landscaping company and accountants actually are great for buying businesses because you know how to analyze the p&amp;l but uh you might be better off buying an accounting firm um you might be better off actually looking at your competitors and some of the others in your same or similar industry so that's more strategic always think first what is your like satellite acquisition strategy where either you already have a skill you're an employee in that business you just go buy a business that is similar number two would be what if you uh are an accountant but you don't want to stay in accounting you want to do something else well then you might want to run uh around and look for a business that necessitates somebody who has a strong financial Acumen um and then third we kind of go through this it's called the dealbox you know this from investing but it's we have our investment thesis categorized by 15 different components that says how much money do you want to make wake where is the business located do you want to run the business or do you want to be an investor in the business do you want the business in which sectors and once you fill out this dealbox I think you know bumper Lanes actually make it easier to to hit the pin and so then you can start narrowing down your deal search and um we we talk about the the 100 to 50 to 10 to one rule which is basically you're going to look at a 100 different companies just like you look at 100 different houses high level on business sites high level publicly and then you're probably going to you know after you're perusing your Zillow of business you're going to narrow down to like 50 that you might reach out most of them are never going to get back to you then you're going to go down to 10 that you get kind of serious with and you might go visit them you might get to know the owner maybe it's people you already know you're going to get into their financials and then you get down to one business that you actually buy and I'm not saying that's the right way to do it always but it's a good rule of thumb we'll be right back curious what you think about the the MBA and college degrees right now I'm not the biggest proponent I mean here's here's what I can say I have an MBA from Georgetown I went all credentials down the way I you know started off at ASU Harvard of the West uh and you know didn't apply anywhere else it was just where I got in for free but then I was you know a Goldman in State Street and Vanguard and uh first truck and so I thought that in order to progress you had to get an MBA that was my idea and so I went and I spent whatever $100,000 Plus getting the Georgetown MBA and added on a PhD to it if I could go back right now and instead take those two years back from my MBA and that $100,000 and instead buy a couple of these businesses I would and and to be perfectly franked I learned nothing related to running a business at my Georgetown MBA I learned a lot about international business which is interesting at the time and I learned a lot about how to make sure the government doesn't [ __ ] with your business too much cuz I ran a pretty big international finance business at the time I also am not in touch with anybody that I went to Georgetown with like they say well if you don't go for the knowledge you go for the network I don't know I have a better network from YPO and EO which cost me like 4K a year and maybe like 10K a year for YPO so I have a little bit of a jaded view about mbas in particular I think it's aome when you're like me you want to climb a corporate ladder and you want a virtue signal or if you don't really know what you want out of life yet and so you just want to see the full spectrum of jobs or opportunities available then I like it but if you want to if you want to be a business owner the best business school is business and it pays you you said you'd wish you had that 100,000 bucks back to buy one or two businesses what kind of business give us an example of a business that you or someone you know has been able to buy for 100 grand the type of business the cash flows where It ultimately ends up in three or five years well the one of the first businesses I bought was a laundr mount for 100k um and it did about $67,000 a year in quote unquote profit but that was also the operators's payment and um and that business was perfect kind of because I had a guy who knew how to run a launder mat he was a real estate guy real estate guys are interesting to partner on some of these businesses because they have to fix a lot of stuff they have handyman uh they usually know like local geography and so he knew that this area was pretty good we also uh ended up buying the the property that it was in um so that business didn't make me much money like I was in finance $67,000 a year plus split with the guy plus whatever extra expenses we have was basically not very much but what we realized from doing that first deal is we could add three or four more to those and that business ended up getting pretty healthy 300 $400,000 uh a year in both of our pockets split between the two of us but in in our pockets and that's when I realized oh there's not that much difference between a smaller uh deal and a bigger deal just confidence at some degree and then also once we did a couple of those then we were like huh we need to add Wash and Fold to this so then one of our laundromats actually one located here in Texas ended up doing $3 million a year in total revenue and then more like a 25% margin on just that one laundromat from a wash and fold add-on and so even a laundromat can scale up to a business that does a couple million dollars a year if you have a few of them one individually no and that's aat is probably the worst business from a total return standpoint out there because you cannot scale it very high and all these VC companies have died at the terar of trying to spend a bunch of money on laundr mats and scale them up but for a new person who didn't understand much you know that's how I made my first couple 100K outside of my 9 to-5 there's a lot of research showing restaurants where the owner is there just do tangibly better I mean isn't this about AC about being really on top of your business and if you want to scale it's about finding and retain aing really talented managers what kind of what kind of people do you look for in your business to bring on to manage these different businesses well one good thing about a lot of these businesses is the word talent is so different here than it is for a media company like the talent at my media company they're expensive they leave all the time um they don't want to do all of the work uh they have a lot of optionality and um you know I'm lucky and that we screen for kind of the right culture fit for us but but that Talent is really hard to manage VC Talent really hard to manage really hard to keep really expensive when I run these small businesses I mean God Laura one of my operators has been with me for years and um is is incredible like never asked for anything runs can run a business that does let's call it almost just seven figures a year and probably will do it for decades for me and doesn't require this really sophisticated product knowledge or sophisticated Talent set I think you know we we owned a mobile home park for instance and like do you know what the operator of a mobile home park makes a year it's funny my father actually his fourth wife owned mobile home parks so I know a little bit about this this is 20 years ago but they made $28,000 plus they had their rent paid for it but that was 10 or 20 years ago well that's yeah so I what I first learned this I was shocked I was like wait a second we paid in my uh mobile home park we paid like 300 or maybe 400 bucks a month to this to the operator of the mobile home park plus they got their rent for free plus they got to screen everybody that came in so they ended up picking their friends and like family members um in order for them to come in as well and that was the entire pay and I remember when I asked originally to the guy at B the mobile home park I'm like why would somebody do this job for so little and um and he said a couple different reasons he said one give them the friends and family perk they really like they like self- select their own Community you know two upgrade them do whatever they want to their actual mobile home like take care of everything for them um and then and then three like that's it just make sure that they're sort of taking care of from that perspective and so you know she's like in her 60s loved the job and ran a mobile home park that did you know God I mean one one and a half $1.7 million a year I think we underestimate how much we have to pay people when we've been in these fancy Industries and then you know we ended up selling the mobile home park and then she got a little piece of it which was kind of cool at the end the thing that always pops out to me about something like this is that return on investment is inversely correlated to how sexy a businesses these are not sexy businesses and but what is sexy as you get older is being able to take care of your kids and your parents and like you said be rich do what do whatever you want is there anyone sector right now that that's propping up that you think represents more opportunity than others I think uh rehab individual rehab homes right now we're analyzing a bunch of them I mean we have an addiction crisis here in the US the likes of which really no country has ever seen before and uh that's not going to get better in the near future and um we do not have enough beds we do not have enough resources for these individuals and originally when I looked at the sector I thought well who has the money to like spend up a $10 million a $50 million rehab center that must be very aggressive but actually there are all these grants for you to do it with single family homes and so there are these small little rehab um I don't even know if you would call it centers houses uh all around the country that are popping up but you get subsidized by the federal government you also get a bunch of tax breaks on top of it you get to do something good uh for individuals you also get some unique tax consequences because it's largely real estate driven you get a landhold on the real estate overall and they're not cheap to stay in and so um this one is there's not very many Home Services businesses that I think can have like a real positive impact too besides that clean communities I think are good for society um but this is one where I think you could make a real impact you can make some money and it's uh probably going to expand crazily and then we're going to eventually see a bunch of PE guys buying it out Cody Sanchez is a former Wall Street investor and the founder and CEO of contrarian thinking a digital educ ation company with over 7 million followers she's also the founder of Main Street holdco a small business holding company focused on bringing Main Street businesses back to the Limelight and contrarian thinking capital A firm that invests money back into the companies that support small business growth uh Cody I think what you're doing is really important not only because it's growing the economy and you're creating jobs but I think there's an unfortunate Zeitgeist that if a kid doesn't go to Dartmouth and end up at Google that he or she has failed and there's other Pathways into the middle class and maybe even to the an upper income home and I think you're sort of destigmatizing it I think you're actually playing a not only an economically important role but kind of a an emotionally and psychologically important role really really appreciate your good work and um you know right on sister well done thank you so much I appreciate it it's it's fun I wish more people realized garbage men have good times there you go sanitation Engineers thanks Cody e
