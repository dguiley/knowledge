# Speed of Iteration

> On a long enough time horizon, the speed of iteration is the only thing that matters.

## The Principle

Learning and business success compound through cycles:
- Try → Fail → Learn → Try again
- Faster cycles = more learning = faster improvement

The person who iterates fastest eventually wins, regardless of starting point.

## Implications

### For Learning
- 100 reps at something teaches more than 10 reps of "perfect practice"
- Failures are more instructive than unspecific successes
- Break skills into sub-skills for faster feedback loops

### For Business
- Ship fast, learn fast
- Volume of attempts beats quality of single attempt
- The Rule of 100 is an iteration forcing function

### For Tracking

> "If you do not track, you do not care. Period."

Without tracking:
- You can't measure iteration
- You can't identify what's improving
- You're just doing, not learning
