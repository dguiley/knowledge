money that we get patterned into in those early years where there is a direct correlation between money and happiness sort of becomes our default setting that we continue chasing yeah Arthur Brooks talks about this as uh us being sort of like mice and we ring the bell and we think we're going to get the cheese and you pattern that in the early years of your life and then you continue chasing it thinking that the cheese is going to be there later in life only to realize far too late that it wasn't and that you pursued all these things you made all this money uh but you have three broken marriages and four kids who don't talk you you think you won the game you got padded on the back the whole way but you're kind of wondering was this a game that I really cared to [Music] win sahill where does this podcast find you I am in Westchester New York just outside New York city so in your debut book titled the five types of wealth a transformative guide to design your dream life you write about five types of wealth time wealth social wealth mental wealth physical wealth and financial wealth can you break these down for us absolutely time wealth is all about freedom to choose how you spend your time who you spend it with where you spend it when you trade it for other things it's fundamentally about an awareness of the precious nature of time of time as your most precious asset social wealth is all about your relationships these are the people that you love the depth of a few close relationships and then the breadth the connection to something bigger than yourself mental wealth is about purpose it's about growth it's about creating the space necessary in your life to engage and wrestle with some of those bigger unanswerable questions in the world whether through religion Solitude spirituality meditation physical wealth is about taking the controllable actions on a daily basis to fight the natural Decay and atrophy that your body goes through with aging it's all about your health and vitality and then Financial wealth as I talk about it is what you think of net worth money uh but with the specific Nuance of really focusing in on your definition of enough what it means to have enough to wrestle with the idea that your expectations are really your single greatest Financial liability if your expectations rise faster than your assets you will never feel wealthy you talk about uh this term or you use the term arrival fallacy why is it important for everyone to understand and what is it the arrival fallacy is this common psychological phenomenon that we've all experienced in one form or another in our life it is the idea that we prop up these specific achievements goals or destinations as the point when we will feel we have arrived you know it could be the promotion it could be the title it could be the bonus the pay raise whatever the thing is we tell ourselves that once we get to X we are going to feel that feeling of happiness and contentment that will be durable and unfortunately it is a fallacy meaning you get to it you feel that sort of momentary uh dopamine infused Euphoria and then you immediately reset to some new arrival that you need some new height some new Summit you also talk a little bit about this term life raiser what did you mean by that the idea of a life raiser is to have a single identity defining statement or rule that allows you to literally cut through the noise at different points in your life so the term razor broadly used is is from philosophy and it's an idea of having a rule of thumb that allows you to simplify decision- making aam Razer is kind of the most famous one that most people know it says that the simplest possible explanation is often the best one the idea of a life raiser is to have a similar simple rule that allows you to navigate whatever chaos or opportunities come it is a statement say uh a single thing that you could say to help you navigate those situations an example would be Mark Randolph the CEO of Netflix who often talks about the fact that he had a rule to to uh never skip a Tuesday dinner with his wife he had a hard rule when he founded Netflix originally he was the first CEO of the company that at Tuesday at 5:00 P p.m no matter what was happening at the company he would leave work and go have dinner with his wife and that was an identity defining rule meaning it had Ripple effects into every other area it meant that he created these boundaries in his life that while he was pursuing all these professional aspirations navigating the chaos of founding a technology company he still put his family and his relationships first that empowered other people to do the same it had all these Ripple effects in his life and it meant something in terms of how his ideal self showed up in the world so having a similar rule like that that is your life Riser it's that single point of focus that helps you navigate through the chaos in life it strikes me when we go back to the different forms of wealth time social mental physical and financial that you you can't have it all you can have it all just not at once and that is I found that my time social mental and physical wealth took a backseat when I was younger in an attempt to establish Financial wealth or at least establish the trajectory and then once I Achieve Financial wealth I was able to go back and work on the previous four so I don't think is anyone's going to argue with you around the different types of wealth as you define them you know the the trick is finding the balance and knowing when to trade off one for the other have you given any thought to the fulcrum between the five of these absolutely and exactly what you said um relates to something that I talk about and write about often which is your life has seasons and what you prioritize or focus on during any one season will change so your 20s and early 30s are an incredible time to focus on building Financial wealth because we know compounding is going to compound for the rest of our journey it's a great time to focus there that being said the traditional wisdom around these different types of wealth is that they exist on these onoff switches and that to turn on financial wealth all the way you have to turn off the others and the unfortunate thing with that mindset is that a lot of these things will atrophy and die if you don't invest in them at all uh you know it's sort of like thinking about you know when you look at a chart of compounding yes you know 1% per day Everyone likes to show that chart it gets you to 37x after a year uh the unfortunate thing is the negative 1% per day which effectively zeros you out after a year and that is really the risk that people run by living with that onoff switch mindset and so what I like to do the mindset shift that I talk about in the book is these areas all exist on a dimmer switch and just because you have one turned all the way up that might be Financial wealth in your 20s and 30s does not mean the other ones should be turned completely off you can still do the tiny little investment on a daily basis that compounds positively because anything above zero compounds in the direction that you're heading so if you think about it just tactically uh for your relationships as an example even while you're focusing on your financial wealth and on building your career sending the one text to your parent to just let them know you were thinking about them making the phone call planning that one extra trip getting together with the old friend for the coffee or gathering the group for the one annual trip those are things that compound positively in that domain that don't take a whole lot of effort the dimmer switch can be turned down without it zeroing you out you know I think about you don't need to call your mom every day I mean ideally you you can and should but if you're working except hard if you only have time to call her once a week that one call becomes much more important and has a higher Roi I'm I say this because I in order to achieve Financial Security I traded off a lot of those things and I did try to you know be home for dinner or at least bath time you know I'm sound like I'm self-conscious which I am but I like the notion that even if you take it down to 10 or 20% that is infinitely better than taking it Taking It Down to zero any specific thoughts about managing the relationship with your partner as you're trying to kind of not go all in go but go mostly in on establishing Financial wealth there are similar principles I would say to you sort of the analog to texting or calling your mom once a week that you can leverage in your romantic relationship so while you are chasing that purpose of building the big company or going all in on your financial wealth making sure that you create a regular Cadence for proper kind of zoom out conversations with your partner uh this entrepreneur named Brad Feld had this concept called the life dinner which I love it's the idea of doing a once a month uh regular Cadence date where you get together to actually talk about some of the bigger picture things in each of your lives lives and in your relationship so talk about some of the challenges some of the opportunities the things you're excited about the things you're stressed about but create a regular Cadence around it because what happens in life is when things get stressful when you have a young child in the house or when you're chasing some Financial goal you forget to do that and so your ongoing communication just becomes this sort of two ships in the night uh you know little things here and there and you forget to zoom out and talk about some of those bigger picture questions that actually contribute to true growth in a relationship so I've always thought that was a really helpful framing for thinking about that and you talked about uh when you were talking about social wealth you talked about front row people uh was the Harvard study of adult development and why do you consider it the most impactful study of the of the last 100 years the Harvard study of adult development is this incredible longitudinal study that was conducted over the course of 85 plus years they followed the lives of 1300 original participants plus another 700 or so direct descendants and what they found was rather remarkable they found that the single greatest predictor of physical health at age 80 was relationship satisfaction at age 50 it wasn't how their cholesterol was their blood pressure it wasn't their smoking or drinking habits it was how they felt about their relationships that contributed to their healthy aging so we know scientifically that the strength of our relationships actually determines our health and happiness in our life and yet when you ask people what they're investing in on a daily basis relationships are one of the first things that fall by the wayside we don't think to invest in relationships in the same way that we think to invest in a financial asset we know putting $100 away in the S&amp;P 500 is going to compound and grow into our future exact same principle applies to your relationships and you need to have that mindset shift to do it the concept of front row people is a sort of visualization and representation of that fact this concept of closing your eyes and thinking about at your own funeral who are going to be the people that sit down in the front row who are those people that occupy that incredibly special cherished space in your life and are you recognizing those people in a daily basis are you showing up for them are you being a front row person to someone else you um also talk about insights that you gathered from couples who have been married 40 plus years what are some of those insights I love uh talking to older people about their kind of wisdom from uh from their lives and the reason I find it so powerful is just because uh you know they have the earned wisdom that none of us have uh and so I went and talked to couples that had been married for uh you know 500 uh total years across all of them and a few of the ones that I thought jumped out number one was never keep score in love um just the idea of in relationships living with a quidd pro quo mindset is a recipe for disaster it's not always going to be 50/50 in a relationship sometimes it's going to be 9010 sometimes it's going to be 1090 but the important thing is that it always adds up to 100 uh and then one of the other ones that I absolutely loved was just the idea of never involve a nonprofessional third party in your relationship conflicts because you will forget about the thing but they never will so telling your mother or mother-in-law sister whoever about the relationship conflict that you are having is often a recipe for a struggle down the line because you will hear about it from them a year or two later uh even once you've completely moved past the thing we'll be right back what is earned status and how is it different from sort of the more traditional views on status status is an interesting topic because it's very easy to um demonize uh and at the end of the day we are status seeking creatures and there's actually nothing wrong with that status is a very smart way of organizing as a society and frankly it has helped us in many ways as humans to navigate all of the changes that we've endured over the thousands of years the point though is you want to Chase and play the right kind of status games uh the way that we typically think of accumulating status uh and when you think about status the way I think about it is what you're looking for is the respect and admiration of others you want to kind of Stack up and have their respect and admiration the way that people typically today try to do that is through uh acquired status symbols it's through the watch it's the car it's the you know fancy club membership it's the you know expensive bottles of wine and we think that those are going to confer this lasting respect and admiration upon us and unfortunately they don't um you know otherwise lottery winners would be held in the highest possible regard among Society because they have a whole lot of those status symbols the reality is that real status has to be earned it is built through these hard one Treasures these things that require long periods of time to build things like a healthy fit physique things like deep meaningful relationships with the people that you love things like building a meaningful business creating a whole bunch of value creating jobs those are the things that actually confer upon us the lasting durable respect and admiration that we want and so the question in the test that I always try to ask is what I call the bot status test uh before buying something you ask yourself would I buy this thing if I couldn't tell anyone about it if I couldn't take a picture of it if I couldn't show it to anyone else would I still want the thing and usually that'll cut through the noise of whether you're doing it as an attempt at bot status uh or if it is something that truly provides utility and happiness in your life the part of the book that I think will probably stand out the most people or be the most read or reread will be you have a list of what you call mental health hacks that you wish you knew at the age of 22 share some of your favorites yeah this is a collaboration with uh Susan Kaine who is for those who don't know an incredible multi-time number one New York Times bestselling author she wrote the book quiet which is uh one of the most famous books of all time written written about the power of introverts in an extroverted world uh and a few of my favorites um from that collaboration number one was your purpose in life does not have to be related to what you do for work your purpose in life does not have to be grand or ambitious your purpose in life simply has to be yours and in a lot of ways this is a a statement that um has rang true throughout history if we if we trace this back in history the Bhagavad Gita famous uh Hindu epic uh talks about the idea of Dharma it's the idea of your sacred Duty that is your purpose and it was that exact statement that it doesn't have to be impressive to anyone else it just has to be yours to me that is such an empowering idea for your mental wealth because you recognize that uh you actually don't need to impress others with the things you're doing you don't need to trying to be impact you know A Billion Lives or do this Grand amazing thing make make a billion dollars whatever the thing is your purpose could be as simple as providing for the people that you love showing up in the way that you want to in the world in a way that you feel like you didn't have in your life that is such a powerful and empowering notion to me that is nice uh you also talk about is the fainman technique Richard feinan was an American theoretical physicist uh won the Nobel Prize in I believe Quantum electrodynamics um and what he was known for was the fact that he was able to simplify complex topics he was able to teach them in terms that anyone could understand and that was really the mark of true genius that he had was his ability to do that the concept of the find technique is that the most powerful way to learn anything is to teach it to others you cannot teach something to others if you don't truly understand it yourself uh and the actual operationalization of this idea is as you were attempting to learn something new the first thing you need to do is default to trying to teach it to someone else and ideally teach it to someone else who is uninitiated sort of explain it to to a 5-year-old if you will uh so you're learning a concept you go try to explain it to someone who doesn't understand that you will immediately know where there were gaps in your understanding or knowledge because the other person will expose them through the points where they're getting confused that ends up being the places where you need to study more fill in those gaps and you'll kind of have this natural iterative process between teaching and learning that will lead you to a true depth of understanding on any topic what are the three pillars of physical wealth that you break down in your book I talk about the three pillars of physical wealth as movement nutrition and recovery and the reason I think it's so important to identify these pillars is because we live in a social media age where you are bombarded by complex sexy information when it comes to your physical health you you are being convinced that unless you are willing to do the Brian Johnson and spend millions of dollars a year on your health uh that you're not going to be able to get healthy and unfortunately for a beginner that type of information is really intimidating and scary and it actually impedes starting it it halts you from starting because you view it as such an intimidating Pursuit the reality is that level one of the physical wealth video game if you will is very very simple across those three pillars move your body for 30 minutes a day don't care if it's walking jogging hiking biking running rowing whatever you like doing move your body for 30 minutes a day nutrition eat whole unprocessed Foods at 80% of your meals that's 17 out of 21 meals during the week and then just try to sleep s hours a night if you can do those three things you are probably getting at 80% of the value in this domain and you're getting ahead of the vast majority of people very very simple and super cost effective you don't have to do the crazy complex regimen to get there finally last type of wealth Financial wealth what can you or what can people do to build Financial wealth what does the research say about uh the connection between money and happiness the research on money and happiness is actually rather clear at this point um the number vary and you know we've all seen the famous Conan study that said $70,000 a year above that you're no longer getting happier and it's an old study and it's been disputed in various forms and uh you know more recent things by Matthew Killingsworth have said something more like 200 300,000 the reality is that all of those numbers are inherently flawed because they're applying an average to the population and you know as uh I think it was Nim TB once said you should never cross a river if it's four feet deep on average uh because in different places it's going to be much deeper than that and you know if you live in New York City the numbers is going to be very different than Omaha Nebraska uh the point though of all of that research is above a certain level uh there are very diminishing returns to incremental money the incremental happiness gains that you have are going to come from these other types of wealth and so the pursuit of money that we get patterned into in those early years where there is a direct correlation between money and happiness sort of becomes our default setting that we continue chasing yeah Arthur Brooks talks about this as uh us being sort of like mice and we ring the bell and we think we're going to get the cheese and you pattern that in the early years of your life and then you continue chasing it thinking that the cheese is going to be there later in life only to realize far too late that it wasn't and that you pursued all these things you made all this money uh but you have three broken marriages and four kids who don't talk to you you think you won the game you got padded on the back the whole way but you're kind of wondering was this a game that I really cared to win and doing this research what did you uncover that sort of affected the way you approach your own life I mean I completely changed my life on this journey I um I was chasing the very traditional definitions of success for the first seven years of my career I was Rising through the ranks in the world of investing a private Equity Fund and I had a single conversation with an old friend that fundamentally changed my life I went out uh for a drink he asked me how I was doing and I told him that it had started to get tough living so far away from my parents on the East Coast I lived 3,000 miles away um they're getting older health things things coming up and he asked how old they were I said mid 60s he asked how often I saw them I said about once a year at that point and he just looked at me and said okay so you're going to see your parents 15 more times before they die and I just remember feeling like I'd been punched in the gut uh the the idea that the amount of time you have left with the people that you love most in the world is that finite andc countable just shook me to the court and and within 45 days my wife and I had sold our house in California I left my job and we had moved across the country to live closer to our families and that was the start of this entire Journey because it reminded me of one important fact which is you are in much more control of your time than you think that number 15 is now in the hundreds I see my parents several times a month they're a huge part of my son their grandson's life we spend so much time with our families and that idea that you can actually control time is such an empowering notion it's such a realization that uh the way that we've been measuring the way that we've been measuring our success in these games uh can change and you can take action to change it sahill Bloom is an investor entrepreneur and writer known for his newsletter the Curiosity Chronicle he's the
