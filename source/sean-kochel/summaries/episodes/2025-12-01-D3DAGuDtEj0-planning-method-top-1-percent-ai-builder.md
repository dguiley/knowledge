# Planning Method Top 1 Percent AI Builder

This episode, hosted by Sean Kochel, discusses effective planning strategies for AI development while emphasizing a structured, user-focused approach.

## Core Thesis
A systematic planning method is essential for successful AI development. This episode introduces the Vibe Planning Pyramid, a three-level framework that helps developers prevent broken projects and inefficient workflows by prioritizing a bottom-up planning process, emphasizing core problem identification, feature prioritization, and user-centric design. 

## Key Insights
- Essential AI coding requires structured planning to optimize development and minimize rework.
- The Vibe Planning Pyramid's levels (What and Why, How and Where, Planning the Build) guide project planning and execution.
- User stories and journey mapping are crucial for addressing user needs and reducing friction.
- Defining a clear technology stack and employing spec-driven development tools enhance project outcomes.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Clarify the core problem and purpose before beginning the coding process to avoid future complications.
2. Develop clear user stories and prioritize features for a minimum viable product (MVP).
3. Define the technology stack early and utilize spec-driven development tools to streamline processes.
4. Regularly incorporate manual testing to ensure functionality and consistency at each stage.

## Notable Quotes
> "Most people just hop into fancy tools... hoping the AI gods will just make their dream come true."

> "Plan right or build twice. Choice is yours."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
