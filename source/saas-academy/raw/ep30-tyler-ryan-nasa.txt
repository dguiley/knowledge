what's up guys today we're talking to former NASA engineer turned entrepreneur Tyler Ryan the wizard behind LTV numbers a SAS company that helps online businesses learn about how much they can spend to acquire their customers Tyler's analyzed over a billion transactions $720 Million worth of sales data from more than 5.5 million customers so you could say he's just a bit of a numbers guy if you are interested in the Journey of how someone goes from being a NASA engineer to leaving what most consider a career job into being a software entrepreneur this is the episode for you I'm Johnny Paige I'm M verle and this is the soucy podcast welcome to the SAS Academy podcast dud I'm super excited to have you on and um I feel like when we first met an event I knew in the first 5 minutes that we were going to be friends because you're a big LA Sports Fan and um it's easy to get along with someone who's got that shared passion for the LA sports team so um I'm excited man we got a lot of great stuff to dive into today but you have a former past life that uh prior to being a SAS founder that I think it's probably one of the most unique like I you know mat up goes firefighter to SAS founder this is equally as is unique you used to be an engineer for NASA can you explain how what first off let's start with like how do you even get a job like that and then we'll figure out how the heck it led to SAS but like tell us about your time uh as an engineer okay well believe it or not I got into to college already knowing that I wanted to start a company of some kind and it just so happened that NASA was the perfect stepping stone for me along the way and all I'll connect some of those dots here so I I just always had that feeling that I wanted to start my own company I mean from from the time I was even like in high school I just always had that sort of entrepreneurial Spirit wanting to do things my own way innovate on things you know question why things are done the way that they are so when I got to college I was really looking for some opportunities to develop a skill set that I knew would be foundational for building a company in the future but I really didn't know what that skill set was going to be I just was keeping my eyes open looking for that opportunity and I was fortunate enough to know a guy that I I played High School baseball with and his dad worked at the NASA jet propulsion laboratory which is out here in Pasadena so it's around the LA area and when I when I came back when I was in college to watch my high school team play a game I ended up sitting next to this guy and he said hey you ever thought about doing an internship at Nasa and I was like at my my entrepreneur brain was like this is one of those moments this is one of those moments because I had no plans of of any sort of internship and I just said no but I would love to let's see where this goes and that ended up being the decision me just saying yes and let's see where this goes that led me to learn software engineering because at that point in time I had never coded before I never really got into program never even really considered it but that ended up being what I realized over the next few years was the foundational skill because when I got into it I realized that with this skill I can kind of do anything right I can build anything I can solve any problem and because I already had that sort of engineer mindset I was studying physics in college it kind of just all clicked into place for me and once I started developing my skill set as a software engineer you know I started the side projects building a baseball stats app just for fun building a document Search tool to help me with my you know my college research just like on and on and on just started building stuff for the sake of it and by the time I graduated I had a job waiting for me at the NASA jet propulsion laboratory and I use that as a place to really learn what it what it takes to build good software and get into a team environment and see how do these guys do it who are way way above me and I'm just coming in as this new guy that doesn't really know all that much about how software is really developed so even though my long-term goal was never to be a NASA software engineer it was about identifying what that track and that environment could do to help me develop those foundational skills and then when I finally had the idea that I wanted to go forward with and start my first company i' had already built up the foundation to make that leap and feel pretty good about it awesome is it you know I've talked to a lot of Engineers that they're typically two different breeds right you've got like the startup I love the build from zero to one I love tinkering around and then you have the more like corporate long you know it's just slower lots of Hoops you got to jump through kind of different a lot less creativity a lot more structure like did did you feel that in NASA and just feel like hey is that part of what led to hey I got to go start and do my own thing or how long was it the lab that you felt like was building the skill sets that were going to be leverage in an entrepreneurial you know Avenue in the future I pretty quickly realized that longterm this was an environment that I could only stay in for a relatively short period of time because to your point pretty much everyone that works there is sort of that long-term you know use the best practices kind of do things the way that they've always been done and it's understandable because that environment is like as risk averse as it gets yeah right we're still using the technology from the 1970s on a lot lot of these spacecraft so if it's if it's not broken don't fix it you know but I came in with much more of the question everything mentality so I found myself sort of butting heads with a lot of the conventional practices inside of the team but it allowed me it forced me really to learn what a best practice environment looks like so I could see where I wanted to diverge and do things differently but I only lasted about a year full-time there before I just said I gotta go what what are one of the key things you learned still think back to from your time as a NASA software engineer that you like that inform how you do things today 100% it's the idea of building clear requirements and a good architecture from the beginning and this is one of these things where you do have to strike the balance right of like move fast and break things but also planning for the future and finding that middle ground and what NASA does really really well is they have such clear requirements and such an incredible planning process that 99.9% of the time it's just going to work on the first try so that that's like the other end of the spectrum right of so much of what we do as entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs a lot of the times it's just like I don't I don't care at all if this works let's just get something and break it and then iterate right but with that you can still do a better job often times of getting it right the first time from an architecture standpoint especially when it comes to software to prevent some of those you know it's a year from now and here you are rewriting absolutely everything from the ground up and so much of it could have been prevented if you just took not a year right but like a week or two of really planning what are the requirements of the system today what do I see the requirements being six months from now a year from now based on the vision that I have for the company today and how can I do a little bit of that architecture planning upfront so I don't do a bunch of unnecessary work later yeah it's interesting I'd love to ask you dude before we move on from the from the NASA phase of of your world so I um I'm a big old space nerd right like my my uncle like worked on the lamb he worked for Grumman um you know even even when I ran my first company up launch like we had a strategic plan for growing the company and it was literally like you know Mercury gemin and Apollo for like the three phases of the company growth um I'm going super nerd here but but I'd love to know like I'm really interested in just company cultures right and the modern-day culture of NASA is one that I know very little about so I'm curious like how does like what I consider the Glory Days of of NASA right like the 1960s and the Space Race like how does that history impact the culture today like is that something where you kind of like Get indoctrinated into like what was achieved during that time period does it affect the work that goes on there you know now in the you know 2020s like how does that show up or does it show up man that's a that's a really good question I think there's a a natural honoring of the history of NASA in every project that gets done because what what might not be obvious to someone on the outside is take for example the Mars rover that it was called the Curiosity Rover and it was Landing on Mars at the time that I was working there in like the early 2010s that project took 10 years and it was one of the most expensive projects in NASA history almost every single person that worked at the jet propulsion laboratory which is like 5,000 people worked on that project and to make something like that happen where that many people touch a project like that and have it work what you're doing so much of the time is you're you're you're almost in awe of all of the past projects that were successful and every individual subsystem engineer is like well we're going to pull this from that project this from that project this from that project and so what happens is everyone kind of knows the entire history of what NASA's done because when you're in 2010 launching a rocket you're still using the stuff from 1960 to build that in a way that you have very high confidence is going to be success uccessful so there's a lot of talk about you know the way things were done 70 years ago why they were done that way and how we can still honor the spirit of that and the Lessons Learned at that time that's really interesting how like what was the compartmentalization like right because I can imagine with 5,000 people touching a project you're like you're working on a switch that touches a widget that touches a subcomponent that touches a comp you know what I mean like you're so far from the overarching thing like I don't know what kind of whatever you can talk about like what kind of stuff did you work on like how dialed into the context of like the big mission were you because I I think there's parallels to what we do in companies especially as our companies grow where you know I might have my my product hat on or I might be worried about getting leads in marketing and I might forget the mission of like why the hell are we here how we serving our customers like I imagine it's that times a million in an operation like NASA so like how do you solve for that like the The missionized View and also the The View two inches from your face you know I mean there really is a perfect parallel between running a a company with Department and then you know maybe even individual teams within that department and the way that a a place like the jet propulsion laboratory operates so there's these different sections that sit up at the top and then different divisions underneath which you can kind of think of like you know you got your customer success you got your product development and and on and on and on Marketing sales and then within that you have these different divisions so if if this is section like 200 then there's 210 and 220 and 230 and 240 and and there really is this incredibly well-thought out structure for how just all of those pieces fit together and fit underneath each other because you need to have very clear communication and structure from the very very front lines right the people that are actually doing the work in side e division all the way up to like the chief of the lab and so this comes back to what I alluded to in the beginning of the extent to which I say that they have a very clear requirements architecture I mean like we have that all the way zoomed out at the entire project level and then we have the next level of detail below that the next level of detail below that and it keeps going and going and going and going all the way until you're at this particular subsystem engineer working on this particular component what are the requirements for that thing but then how does that requirement fit within the 20 requirements for that overall payload right then how does that payload bubble up to the subsystem then how does that subsystem bubble up to the system and then how does that bubble up to the overall objective of the mission so any individual engineer knows exactly why their thing is important what it needs to do what the requirements are for it and how it impacts the next level of abstraction above them so everyone always knows what they're doing and why at all times super important love it so basically for anyone out there trying to figure out where to find your technical co-founder just go to the jet propulsion lab is probably a good spot some some some brains M around in there who know how to organize a project no doubt man I mean there's there's incredible Engineers there yeah that's awesome there really are well Ryan here I want to get God I just did it again dude your last name's jacking me up you're jacking me up um so Tyler here's where I want to go for the rest of the the conversation I want to take the listeners through um how you get how you validate like you were tinkering building lots of different products how do you land on LTB numbers so I want to go through sort of the origin story of getting the company off the ground and then for those listening what I want you to know about Tyler and his time from the you know Matt and I met Tyler about uh about a year ago now um events was the first time we got to hang out in person and I think I told you in that first conversation I was like dude you are going to win I at the time the company was like pretty early like it was you you're one of the the earlier stage companies in there and there's just you have a way of thinking and part of it I think comes from we just got to hear where where the source is from like the the systems oriented mindset um to how you're building the business I knew in a f minute conversation whether it was LTV numbers or another product you're GNA be a successful entrepreneur you just talk to enough and you can see it so I want for those listening I want you to clue in because Tyler has a way of thinking that if you will pattern match your chances of success go up significantly so let's talk about the origin story let's talk about why LTV numbers what's the problem you guys are solving and then I want to I want to talk about what where you're you're focused moving forward like what is the future of of the product and the and the company the company building side um of the of what you're doing so let's start with how do you get from your your you're tinkering you start to feel the the the pace of learning diminishing and NASA and the urgency to go build something else increasing what talk us through the transition and and put us on a timeline if you don't mind like where are we at like what year are we at um and how long ago was this okay so I have a almost somewhat of like a mental framework around how I have moved through my career because it really has been pretty intentional from the beginning and it really stems from not falling into uh what is called the perfect pick fallacy which is this idea that you need to know what you exactly what you want to do from the beginning because I really didn't and I I want to stress that it's not like I had this business background I mean I was a pure engineer and when I say that I mean like a pure engineer with no business experience it's not like I had a family with a ton of business experience like none of it I didn't know the first thing about starting a company so to me all that mattered was just being directionally correct and in the beginning you know the least right you don't know what you want to do you don't know how you want to do it most likely so to me the first directionally correct step was to just start anything any company doesn't even matter what it is because I know that if I do that it's going to throw me into a new environment it's going to throw me into a new set of learnings it's going to show me a bunch of stuff that before were unknown unknowns that I can now start to demystify and that will just move me in the right direction because then I'll be more informed for the next pick right and make that directionally correct but with a little bit more of a narrow lens right so my first directionally correct pick was I'm currently a full-time employee I've saved up enough money in my bank account to survive for like two years even if I don't make a dollar so I'm just going to go all in make the leap and see what happens and this was back in 2017 how old Tyler how old were you when you did this like what was your stage of Life there like 23 okay cool 23 yeah and you know I was living at my parents house while I was working at Nasa just trying to save every dollar I could because I wanted to have that Runway to be able to just make this leap worst case scenario I just go get another engineering job there's like really not that much of a risk the worst case scenario honestly not even really that bad so to me it was like let's just do it see what happens so I made made the leap on my first company and to give you an idea of what it was it was a document search technology that was designed to help someone find a piece of information in a large library of documents you can see where I might have gotten some inspiration from that right being at JPL I talked about the huge requirements documents and everything I mean that right there was a real problem it it's clear if I'm operating in this tiny little section but if I need to find like someone else's requirements or some other information it was a really really big challenge so to the point about just being directionally correct did I think that a document search company was G Gonna Change the World and become like my hundred million dollar company I was gonna work on for the rest of my life not a chance right but I was okay with that because it wasn't about that right it was about putting myself in the ring so that I could then realize wow this is what it takes to build real software when I don't have anybody else on my team to look to now I have to step into that role of the architect I have to build the MVP I got to be the one that fills out the blank sheet of paper right and at the same time were you aware of this um what you call it the fallacy of the perfect pick were you aware of this when you're making were you aware of this or is this because this is like lessons you hear all the time in hindsight like oh advice if I had could give advice early on i' do this were you aware of this when you're making the you making the decision to go build a document search product I didn't have the label for for it but intuitively I knew exactly what I was doing there for sure who who who what Mentor or influence had did you have that like LED you to think like that like where'd that come from it was probably my dad because he he went to school for soil science uh you know agricultural school he grew up on like Farm life and then he came home and told his parents I'm G to be a full-time musician nice nice I mean talk about like there's no way you have a plan there right right it's just like I'm gonna I'm just gonna start working local bars doing whatever it takes right you're just kind of like make the leap make the leap and figure it out so I love it I mean he knew like he wanted to be a musician I guess so there was that level of of clarity that he had but fundamentally it's kind of the same idea right because there's a lot of different subcategories inside of just being a musician and he started as like a songwriter and then went to a you know a performer with a band and had a record deal in the LA area toured around the Southwest had a pretty solid following and fan base the Tony Ryan band and then it ended up leading him ultimately to becoming a private guitar teacher and that's what he's been doing for like 25 plus years now and man that's awesome it was just that's cool one directionally correct pick at a time time until you finally Converge on where you want to end up man that's great that's great so you're you're building the the the product they get you directionally accurate what's that lead to what it leads to is me building a really really cool piece of software that did exactly what I wanted it to do and then realizing that nobody wanted to pay for it best lesson man best lesson how long it take you to find that out that's an okay lesson you know look if it takes you two months wants to figure that out you know not a ton of harm how long did we go before we realize great product no users no willingness to pay about a year and a half all right and all right that's what made it such a good lesson honestly for me because what I the Trap that I fell into where I didn't know what I was doing is I had no network of support at the time I didn't know any other entrepreneurs I just left NASA where all my friends are like lifelong corporate Engineers essentially right and because I didn't know that there was even a community of entrepreneurs to tap into my co-founder and I who he also worked at Nasa at the time we quit together we kind of just worked in isolation and we just thought let's go build this thing let's make something really great and then when it's done we'll go take it to Market and then figure it out and it was something that stuck with me so strongly because it took so long to learn that lesson because it's like being in a dark room for a year and a half showing the world look what I made and realizing oh my gosh nobody wants this I feel that never gonna make that make never gonna make that mistake again it's one of these fallacies that big companies like everyone I think thinks of like you know quintessential Steve Jobs on the stage you know here's the unveiling you know a thousand CDs in your pocket type type moment everyone's like let me go have that moment you know we'll find the needle in the hay stack of documents and it's like we forgot this one thing right make sure people are going to buy it it's uh man so like that's a tough lesson and and I'm assuming you pretty much just flipped the order of operations as you moved into your subsequent Ventures yeah oh I mean the takeaway was I'm never going to start anything else without monetizing it first you know just flip the script helpful when you're 18 months into a 2-year Runway you're like all right now we got to find something we can sell first then build after good forcing function well I mean it was a real fork in the road moment because you know I can really laugh about it now but you can imagine at the time that was like a low point in my entire life yeah like maybe this entrepreneur thing is not the path that I want to go down and for my co-founder he decided that it wasn't he's like nope not doing this anymore and he went back and got a job at Google and he's had a bunch of tech jobs since then super successful but I was like I'm going to keep trying and with the remaining money that I had in the runway I used it to join my first ever business Mastermind coaching program and then I had about three months left to make enough money to be able to self-fund you know paying rent and all that stuff and that kind of gets into the next stage of of the journey right there but I wouldn't have come to that realization with the the gravity that I did right without going through that period and realizing wow I don't know anything about business at all even my instincts weren't right I need to get around people that do stop isolating myself and get a supportive environment of people who have been there around me just like I did to develop the engineering skill right but I didn't make that connection on the business side of things at the time because I just really didn't know what I didn't know it's uh it's really interesting how I say all the time one of the it's hard to hear it when you're building I say it's very important not to fall in love with a product and instead fall in love with the problem and and talk to people about the problem how does it show up and it's just such a big risk early on that it's hard to hear you you feel like oh and it's also playing to the thing you enjoy doing it's like I don't know the business side and it seems fuzzy and unknown but I do know the product side and I know what I need to go build next and I'm having fun building it so it's really easy to get like that's where all the dopamine hits and the feeling of progress are the feeling of inadequacy and impostor syndrome is all on the business side so even no matter how many you know podcasts and books you've heard about hey make sure you go get validation on your product is such an easy um you know thing you don't you don't do it you don't make a conscious decision to say hey for the next six months I'm do this you just wake up on a Monday and you're like what do I want to work on today oh it'd be fun if I built that thing or or do should I go figure out how to monetize this now I'll do that next week I'll do it tomorrow and you just kind of look up you give uh you give an inch at a time you look up six months later and you've uh you haven't don't have the validation on the product so it sounds like a hard-earned lesson you join a a mastermind and get around a community people like what comes what did you go start was that where L TV numbers comes into play not yet nope directionally correct next so I I moved into this you know this new chapter of I'm going to this business Mastermind once a month getting around a b bunch of other entrepreneurs and people who were way more successful I mean I had no success at all to speak of but when I when I mean way more I mean talking about people with like million dollar plus a year companies you know and I'm coming into that room and my mentality was okay clean clean slate I don't know anything about what problems I should be trying to solve now but I do know that I want to solve problems for people like these so let me take this environment and use it as a way of just doing R&amp;D essentially you know when people stand up to share their challenge with the group during The Mastermind what's everybody saying and I kept hearing things related to Tech at that time so this is not LTV yet people struggling with stuff that was easy for me you know and remember this is like 2018 now so there stuff wasn't quite as mature and ubiquitous as it is today so people struggling with things like setting up custom domains and email automation sequences and special payment processing and all this stuff that for me was like oh that's that stuff's easy you know and I heard enough of that to say well I should at least let everyone here know that I can do that stuff see if I can maybe help someone out no intent of monetizing at this point right just like well I can solve some of those problems that's what this group is for right people helping each other sharing lessons so I did a lot of just sitting next to people on their laptops at these events helping them with like basic Tech stuff and I did that for enough time that I started to be known in the group as like The Tech Guy and you can imagine that there probably weren't really anybody else in the group like me because this was like a pure business Mastermind there's no Engineers really in the room everyone's like you know Fitness business and supplement company and uh online courses and all that stuff so I really was able to carve that identity out for myself within that community and when I was watching my Runway shrink to zero I said I had like three more months left in the bank and I was like in that final month I I just got up at one of these events and said hey I've heard you guys mention you have a lot of challenges with tech you can hire me and at this point in time I had made a dollar as an entrepreneur and I from that and the conversations that followed I made like $3,000 in seven days and it was like oh my gosh what a difference you know that was that was enough money to like cover the next month yeah like wow so that was the real light bul moment for me of what I did there of getting in the room seeing what problems people had helping where I could without any expectation of anything other than just the experience in providing that help and then basically getting to the point where people were asking if they could work with me and then just saying you know what I'm gonna start taking clients and that was the beginning of what became my second company which which was called fitun funnel guys and that name came from building out sales funnels for Fitness businesses there was a disproportionately high number of Fitness businesses in that room and I worked on that for the next two years and that was really where I feel like became an entrepreneur right I I built out sales funnels I was inside these companies I was making money I had another person that I brought on to the team so it that really was a true business success for me and a huge step in the right direction because I was getting paid to learn so much about how these companies operated and because I was on the inside now I would see the follow-up questions you know the sales funnel launches and then two months later they're like hey can you help me analyze my sales data and this is what began the stepping stone Journey towards LTV but I'll pause right there because that was sort of step two damn cool is that what uh so is that what led to your clickfunnels award on the back on the back wall there was that the one it it was one of the clients that I got during that time but this didn't happen until LTV got it dude that's cool well we'll get to that cool and so it was essentially first off I love like the first dollar on the internet moment that you shared I still remember mine too right it's I'm sure Johnny does too it's like that that first moment you're like oh man like this can be more than just effort right like there's actually a transaction here this could be cool we go figure out how to do it a million more times um so that's a great one to share um but I I love the like the each stepping stone is a new lesson to learn that leads to the next evolution of the business right so it's like getting in the room seeing there's Tech issues Tech issues lead to setting up sales funnels sales funnels lead to the second order questions which I'm sure that's the through line of like sales metrics leading to LTV and and getting that company start up man just one of the mantras I had with my co-founder Jake in our first company was the same thing you're talking about Tyler was just next right move right like whatever don't stress over all the stuff just next right move what's in front of me what's the next right move you know and it seems like you've really mastered that completely agree I mean I think that was that was the thing that because I was operating that way to me it just kept my my mind in the right place to identify those things along the way right and not to just ignore these signals that I'm getting when I'm sitting in the room and it's like oh wow out of the 25 questions that people have brought up like 15 of them were related to Tech in some way maybe I could do something about that so fast forward as to the start of LTV numbers what year do you begin the product and then walk us through the launch um it sounds like you you you defaulted to hey let's let's monetize this so i' love to like take that take us through when do you realize that there's a a challenge to be solved here when do you start monetizing it like where are we at on the annual timeline yep okay so I started fit funnel guys around 2017 2018 and now we're like 2019 okay so it's been year and a half two years and I had heard a lot of these second order questions about analyzing data now that we had solved the sales funnel problem right so the new problem created by the solution that that we provided and at that point in time I I really was looking for my next thing because I wanted to get back into software and I learned the lesson during that period of how valuable it is to proceed your software with Services because you're right in the mix of things providing real value people who are already paying you money who are super willing to tell you all of their other problems that they have and super open to trying your unproven solution right so once I heard all these questions about data analysis when I took a step back and sort of tried to see what the commonality was across all of them they all had something to do with customer Journeys and LTV because the questions were like can you help me figure out how much I can afford to spend to acquire a customer that's an LTV question can you help me figure out how many of my new customers buy my higher level program on the back end it's a customer Journey question which is also really an LTV question can you help me figure out how long it takes my new customers to buy something else customer Journey question LTV question and when I asked them well like why can't you do this now and they said well we do our front end sales over here on clickfunnels we do our backend sales over here on Shopify the data's all over the place you know we have some other things out here that we just do directly into stripe and you hear this like data organization challenge combined with analyzing that data across all of these different isolated platforms so it was becoming clear to me that there was an opportunity there to solve all of those problems at the same time and because I was looking for a software opportunity this was clearly it to me and it really all crystallized when I was I was at this event in the end of 2018 as a quick story I was sitting in a room with about 400 other online business owners listening to a guy named Joel Mar and give a talk titled how to scale your business 10 times bigger 10 times faster if you don't know who Joel Marian is he started a company called BioTrust trust and they scaled from Z to 150 million in like 18 months just a ridiculous ridiculous growth Journey that's a ride wow unreal just unreal so when this guy's talking about how to scale your business 10 times bigger 10 times faster I'm like tell me please so he gets a few minutes into his talk and he asks a question to the room he says how many of you know your average customer life value just a single number average customer lifetime value and of the 400 people in the room there were maybe like 50 hands there's a lot of beginners in the room too so keep that in mind and he goes okay not bad now how many of you know your customer lifetime value at day Zero 30 60 90 and 180 and there was maybe 20 hands okay not bad now how many of you know your customer lifetime value at day 0 30 60 90 and 180 for each product funnel traffic source and affiliate that sends you customers and there were four hands and this burned into my mind because the room literally went from 400 down to four 1% of the room and he asked each of them how big's your business 15 million 25 million 35 million 50 million and he just goes I'm not surprised then he goes on to give this entire talk where the punchline of that talk talk was the reason why we scaled the way that we did is because we could answer that last question better than anybody else and that's how you scale your business 10 times bigger 10 times faster and I was like let's go that's all I needed to hear because I was already seeing the analytics the LTV thing and he just said that's exactly what you need to do and then he got to the end of his talk though and someone comes up for Q&amp;A and says man this is awesome how did you do it and he goes well I hired a developer and a data scientist for 200 Grand a year to answer this question and you could hear the whole room go like oh and there's one guy in the back being like yes opportunity if I could build the thing that he could have said instead of that answer right at the end of that talk he would have had the entire room going to sign up challenge accepted that that really was like the the the moment where LTV numbers started it was that moment right there but I couldn't have gotten to that point if I wasn't working in fit funnel guys seeing those signs of that same challenge so that I could then be in that room for that talk and have the light bul moment that really led to the start of the company yeah I love it man uh so tell us where is LTV numbers today like how where where are you so it started in 2019 okay where's the business at today and has it changed the promise it sounds like that you set out to unify all these data sources be able to answer the question of how much is your customer worth at a zero through 180 multiple channels is the promise still the same so give us a sense for what's the promise in Focus now it's the problem that you're solving and then give us a sense where the business is at okay so I'll start with where the business is at so we're about five years in now and I want to to give the context that I wrote all of the code in the software so I didn't have the money to hire a team I didn't really have anyone around me that I felt like I wanted to bring on this journey with me my you know my other co-founder that would have been my first choice he was working back at Google didn't want to take that chance again so I was really on my own in starting this so I I did everything wore every hat from the beginning so where the company's at now is we're at about 16k mrr but about 10 of that has come in the last like nine months so as of last year it was like 5ish K mrr so I had this really really long period of time where I was building the software still doing some of the client work and essentially working through this transition period of being 100% Services right fit funnel guys to then introducing LTV numbers to some of my existing clients and I got my first real like okay I'm doing this thing moment when I found one of my clients to pay me three grand a month to be their dedicated data analyst and I really want to stress this point because this was another example of preceding the software with the service just kind of doubling down on that because I knew that I could provide a lot of those benefits just with like Google Sheets and whatever if I had to right so if I could just get someone to hire me to be the analyst then I could essentially get paid to develop the software to make my job easier right so that I could then do that with more businesses and it takes less of my time to deliver the same value and I'm now the ultimate power user of the thing that I'm developing so I know everything that it needs to do I'm getting immediate feedback because I'm every week on a call sharing the results of the analysis that I did and I was essentially doing customer-driven product development without anyone actually being a customer of the software itself they were just a customer of me right and the analysis service that I was providing so I used that three grand a month as like my my runway for that and developing the software along the way and eventually it got to the point where the software was good enough that I could take on another client like that and then I could also start offering the software by itself without needing to be the analyst and that was gradually how I moved away from fit funnel guys to just entirely either doing analytic services or providing the software as a service and that's what got me through those four years where like I said my Mr was only like 5K but I would make more money in other ways you know supplementing it with some Services supplementing it with some analytics work on the side yeah I'm in love with the story dude I'm in love with it and I will tell you why sorry Johnny I think I stepped on you but I just got to let this out man we were gonna say the same thing bro go for it I mean I feel like with every passing year there's just more and more opportunity for people to bootstrap B2B SAS companies you know um like the capex keeps getting lower but the people who struggle with it the most are the ones who want to go straight from zero to SAS right they they're like I just need to build this pure thing services are yucky like no unless you hate money like do the service live get paid to get smart and then build the software to solve the problem that you have providing the service like the the most useful frame for this man is like and I say this all the time Marcel says this all the time it's think of it as a human being hiring your software to go do a job if you use that frame you'll never miss right like people are essentially hiring LTV numbers today to provide the analytics work that you were doing for that customer for three grand a month you know four or five years ago Y and so it's just if you think through that through that frame you will always be in your customer's mind because you're just hiring the software to do the job it's software as a service like it's that name actually has meaning and I think people forget it man so I just Tyler you smashed it like for what it's worth like I feel like that's what bootstrapping a company properly actually looks like you can do it without that and get lucky no doubt plenty of people have but by providing the service and then using the software make the service go faster like that's the way where you you drisk the whole thing so just brother Kudos like I just I love your story man I think it's done it's done really really well thanks man I it was really hard in the moment you know I know I know you guys know that it's not dude it make no mistake about it it's not a sexy label like Z to 150 million in 18 months now that's a sexy lab like hey sign me up for that but the reality it's a we're we're engineering for success and engineering for the alternative is we got to go raise a bunch of money and take a huge risk right if we and so you are drisking the likelihood of failure by doing it over a longer period of time and building it on you in the trenches solving the problem like it's very hard to build a product that doesn't work when you're actually you hand toand combat very easy to do it like your first scenario when you're in the back room coding for 18 months and it doesn't survive customer contact like yeah so much I I tell you Tyler a lot of what we teach in our early stage program is this exact concept it's like hey you got to go out like it's it's fighting against the exact thing that that what was the name of the document the um did you have a name for the product the first product you built the oh the document search yeah it was called jump sweet so so you know it's it's protecting against your the methodology that you use to build jump and encouraging this methodology that you use to launch LTV numbers so um I love it man how where is it at today are you able to is it are you selling the product independent of services or is it still in this like hybrid journey of there Services up front to get it all set up and then they run on the product it help us understand the customer journey into it are you um yeah is it product Le service Le hybrid yep so as of today it is a hybrid of the two where it kicks off with the service and transitions into the software so we still do the integration the setup the onboarding you know so it's like that white glove onboarding experience but then what we do that also allowed us to really stand out from other analytics companies is we analyze the historical data of the company on your behalf come to our first call that we call our insights call and we have this entire report put together of findings and takeaways and I want to stress this as a point because this is packaging the expertise developed along the way in the product and service that we provide so it's not just like well we have this Analytics tool now give it to them and let them figure it out it's like well hold on a second I've analyzed now like $700 Million worth of sales data you know how valuable it is for me to give them that analysis expertise right out of the gate yeah so that way they have massive value before they've even used the software if I were to withhold that in a lot of ways I'm kind of cutting the legs out from under the software because that's what made the software possible and I was using that software along the way as I was providing the service so I already know how to use the software to find out the things that matter so why don't I just do that for them up front so they have a really really great Foundation to kick off from yeah so this became a true Cornerstone of the experience because analytics is one of those domains that inherently has this activation energy in the beginning of like many people get into it and they're just like what now yeah I mean you know I know my way around charts and graphs but like I'm not a data analyst and maybe you have the small handful of users that are but in my my case a lot of these users are like business owners right or like marketing people so if you can tell them like here's what your data says that's really the experience that they want not to just like dig around inside of analytics software so I've realized that has to be a Cornerstone of the value proposition but again I wouldn't have realized that without doing the service first what I have questions um because I love this model and the reason I want to double click on this for a second Tyler is because I think there's a lot of people listening to this podcast in one of two mindsets right either they're offering services with their software and they're looking for Best Practices on how to do it or they're not offering services with their software and they're thinking maybe I should be right and so you know before we got on this call I cruised through your website checked it out love it super super simple um but one of the things that stood out to me is that you're onboarding starts at five grand right um I'm not saying anything it's not on the website so um do you find that like does that correlate to like the type of business that can actually get a return from analytics like is that also like a qualification mechanism for you if they're not willing to put the five grand up they're probably not big enough to have enough data to make it worth being a customer of yours 100% and think about this from like the bootstrappers mentality in the beginning if you just purely went for as many users as possible right you would eliminate a lot of these upfront barriers and just get people in the door by any means necessary as soon as you do that you start to really dilute your ability to extract the lessons from any individual user because now you have you know hopefully right like a lot of people coming in the door but you're probably not talking to all of them you now have larger customer support requirements which you're probably going to be the one servicing and where I want to focus is not on the customer support problems I want to focus on the customer success problems and in the beginning that's the more valuable of the two to me so I would rather have fewer clients create some barriers to entry and also in doing that have the clients that come on board be the ones far more likely to use it because that's where I'm going to get the most value in learning so I can do better with my product development from that point forward and it solves a second order problem I think because in my opinion at least one of the hardest things from a a product and software engineering standpoint to build well is your initial onboarding especially for a technically complex product right we're not you know just clicking a button here you setting up charts setting up data streams like that would this would be a really really really difficult software platform to self onboard to and so I think that by making the service a Cornerstone of your activation you also like make it so you don't really have to solve that problem in the product as nearly as quickly right you might go forever without I still have not solved that problem right and you've made it a value ad instead of a something that keeps you up at night which I think is a really a really wonderful way to do it like how are you still doing the onboarding personally like is that you or have you trained people to do that what's your thoughts there uh still doing it still doing it and this is the thing that I I realized I want to hold on to as long as I possibly can now I don't I don't need to be the one to do like the technical Integrations right but the amount of of learning that I get from analyzing the businesses data and having that initial call I mean that's where I've literally learned everything that I've learned has been on those calls the questions that they ask the things that they find interesting the things that they don't the ways that I need to use the software to deliver the value that I want I wish it could do this probably should go build that it's really been the thing that's driven all of the development of the platform to this point in time and what I thought was just going to be like a temporary thing of let me have this as like a filtering mechanism I mean we can get into this later but I've realized that this is actually going to be a core part of the Grand Vision for the company yeah it it really has to be for for for products in this space like data analytics you have to get them over the hump of trusting the data so you could try to go product Le growth but the the more janky and jacked up all their data sources are the harder it is to get there they just lose hope and they go back back to doing it the way they were so like you you have to frontload getting to the moment of value which is giving the Insight so what's the biggest question mark and proove that all of the work of stitching together the data sources and having better data Integrity to get the insights is wor the juice is worth the squeeze so like dude I think you are absolutely hon there's some very large data and insights companies in all types of different categories in a upfront onboard you know handheld onboarding and Professional Services model is like really common in that space so I you know and I think it's the to Matt's point it's the thing that leads to the product becoming more more capable um over time and or so your retention numbers are just G to be through the roof I I think I want to I want to shine the light on one one thing first off I hope you're picking up on this listeners remember the promise I said there's something very unique and successful about the way that Tyler thinks and that the way he structures onboarding process is part of it so I hope you grab that steal it and keep that with you you as you build your companies the uh point that I wanted to stress shoot I just lost the train of thought where was it [Music] um dang it it'll come back um anyway so let's take so you are look dud I think in the research for this you've you've analyzed over a billion transactions 720 Million worth of sales data over 5.5 million customers um can you can you talk to us like what does it mean to be be data driven in your opinion what does it mean to be data driven before I answer that I just want to highlight the fact that all of those things that you just said are true is a huge part of what overcomes the trust obstacle when I bring new people on board if I never did the services part I wouldn't be able to say any of that that really is what makes the service stand out because many compan that are in our space they might say like you know we've had a lot of data come through our platform but there's something different about hearing that we've personally analyzed this data and you're going to be leveraging that expertise the first time that we talk totally different frame coming into the relationship so just wanted to highlight that okay cool what does it mean to be data driven I use this analogy that I think is is really it's really good visualization of how I think about this and it's the idea of having some kind of autopilot in your car or in your you know your airplane when you have autopilot the whole intent there is to make it so 99% of the little decisions are just made for you right like the micro corrections to steering the changes to your speed the stuff that you don't really need to be be involved in the decision- making process of so 99% of those decisions taken off your plate let's call those the low leverage decisions the 1% is what you're left with and this is where your expertise really comes into play this is we need to change our destination alt together or we're going to be hiring someone or launching a new product and therefore we need to do something different this is you know there's an issue on the runway at the place that we're going to land so me as the pilot I need to take over and make sure we can circle around to buy ourselves some time these are the high leverage decisions and I fundamentally believe that as business owners leaders decision makers what it means to be data driven is to let 99% of the decisions be made for you so that you can just make the 1% and I think it doesn't usually get thought about in that way because data if used the right way should just tell you what to do it should just give you the answer like you you don't even have a role in the decision- making process it's just like well data says this so we're going to do that but there's a small handful of decisions where we have to bring our gut our intuition our research our expertise into play and maybe even our emotions in that case as well but for 99% of them all that stuff is detrimental to making the right decision yeah so that to me is the foundation of what it means to be data driven making 99% of the low low leverage decisions for you so you can focus on the high leverage 1% but can you give an example of like uh of a client that you worked with that was making the N that was spending you know time energy emotion creativity making the 99% decision what's what it's like when you turn the lights on you say look the data should tell you absolutely I'm I'm GNA answer that and I'm also going to use it to transition into this scale sealing pyramid framework that I have because I think it really underscores this idea and it actually ties into this which we opened the loop on earlier so I had this client when I was working uh with the fit funnel guys we buil out a funnel for them and they were really struggling to scale they were kind of stuck in this no man's land of scale where they're you know they're sometimes profitable sometimes not there are customers that they're acquiring can go up and down from day to day week to week and they're afraid to push the gas and spend more because they don't like what they're seeing in the numbers but here's the thing what numbers were they looking at well they were looking at number of new customers they were looking at their ad spend they were looking at their revenue from those customers they were looking at the aov on that initial sale and what they kept seeing was that they were either barely breaking even or losing money on the initial sale so all of their decision-making was around trying to improve the ROI on the ads because that was the dat that they had visibility into but they also weren't asking some of the questions they should have been asking at the time so they were saying like Hey we're losing money on the front end let's improve the conversion rate on the landing page let's try to increase our average order value by putting more upsells and things like that into the into the funnel it's all the wrong questions to be asking and it was because they didn't have the data that they needed to let the data Guide so what this would lead them to is to maybe do things like ah this offers not working let's kill it this is like the 1% up at the top of like hey I know the data is telling us to do these things but like we just can't keep doing this anymore we can't justify it but the problem is if you don't have data visibility into the stuff that matters you can't effectively let the Data Drive you so here's what happened I got LTV numbers set up with this company because they were one of my first uh LTV clients we realized when we got LTV set up and loaded loaded in all of the historical data that their customer LTV went from about $25 they were selling a low ticket product on the front end from about $25 to about $75 in 21 days this was a complete Eye openening game changer for the decision-making process because they were comparing everything to $25 so they're like 12 days later they become a 7 so 12 days later they become a $75 customer but they're super worried about losing money on on you know 12 days prior yes exactly so they were actually very profitable they just couldn't see it so this comes to the scale ceiling pyramid the foundation of the pyramid is visibility if you couldn't see that then you could never know right so if you don't know you're going to make decisions with this small piece of information when there's this much bigger picture that you're completely missing so that's the foundation the pyramid you got to have visibility into the stuff that's going to drive decision making and I fundamentally believe LTV is one of the biggest drivers for decision- making so you got to have visibility into it on top of that you have analysis so once you have the visibility how are you going to use that data to lead to the decisions so we got visibility and then we can analyze that data we have visibility into so that it leads to our meaningful decisions and then on the very very top is action so we got visibility analysis action and the action comes from acting on the decisions that you got from your data analysis and if you don't have visibility to start you're kind of playing the wrong game from the beginning you're that company that's just focusing on aov in conversion rate blah blah blah wasting time spinning your wheels because you didn't have the visibility to let the Data Drive you into where you actually needed to be focusing so that company as soon as we had that visibility and we have the analysis is of the LTV to say Hey you could actually spend like $50 to acquire a customer right now you're spending 30 guess what they did they cranked up the scale and next thing they knew they had made a million dollars from that funnel and they sent me that as a thank you yeah that is cool that's cool so for those listening Audio Only Tyler's pointing to a is that a clickfunnels cunel describe what's behind you yeah yeah clickfunnels to Comic Club award plaque which you get for doing a million in sales in a funnel that's awesome man very cool story it's funny it reminds me we're we're we both are sports fans and there's certain NFL coaches that are known as analytics guys right they go whatever the analytics tell them to do they take all of the you know the emotions out of it how a feeling recency bias and it's like nope if the analytics say to go for it on fourth down we're going for it on fourth down I love it save save the 1% for the things that really need the 1% that need the discretion let the get the visibility and do the analysis to let the decision or the data make the decision for you right and and I just want to stress that in that setup there where most businesses missed the Mark is on the visibility part it's just they don't have the visibility in the first place to do the analysis and make the decisions and that was where I felt like there was the biggest need in solving the problem visibility really is the foundation of everything I'd love to double click on something you said because I thought it was really interesting you mentioned that 99% of decisions should essentially just be see the data make a decision like no big deal 1% are the ones that really require the human element right um how do you tell the difference really really good question this is probably the hardest question in this in this space the way that I think about this is it's kind of like the sports analogy really which is the only way to really find out for your business which ones are the 99% and which ones are the one is to have a datadriven approach in a certain key area of the business let the data drive your decisions and then see if it worked or not it you can't answer that in isolation Matt is what I'm saying you have to try it and say oh we used the data to inform this decision we made the decision turned out to be completely wrong that must have been because you had a lack of visibility somewhere so it creates this this feedback loop where you use a data-driven approach you realize there was a gap in it you take that opportunity to identify the Gap fix it have better visibility next time around so you can make a better decision then you iterate and iterate and iterate until most of the time the data driven decisions are just the correct ones but it's never going to be 100% of the time so it is a little bit of an art but the most important thing to take away I think is to get the visibility have a decision-making process and then let it iterate over time as you realize the gaps in it yeah like step one have the option step two use it and then find the 1% I'm curious Matt what do you what is your answer to that like you're uh you're constantly bringing more and more data into our conversations in how we run SAS Academy and and into the conversations of how we we coach our clients like how do you tell the difference between when when to make a data driven decision versus when to make a more intuitive one which I think is that the the TS of the Continuum here yeah I think um I think my answer is probably saying something similar to Tyler a different way but the and everyone has different mental models right but but for me I look at at any piece of data as essentially like a a causal Chain Reaction right so you've got a thing that causes a thing that causes a thing that causes a thing that causes the data that you're actually concerned about right it's like the sales funnel is the ubiquitous example right demos on the calendar they attended close rate hoay money right so the way that um that I look at this is you know for every one of these metrics pieces of data that we're looking at there are actions or behaviors that that drive them kind of Upstream of the output that we're looking at and and this comes from a lot from Amazon right my thinking is influenced heavily by the way that they they approach their data um and in fact also by Cedric chin who we just had on the podcast as well um but so essentially like the intuitive part of this whole thing is figuring out what are the input metrics or the activities that can actually influence the output metric that you're concerned about right like that's the hard part so I think to me like Tyler when you say make the data driven decision it's essentially like doing a better job executing the hypothesis you already have for instance like if I say in my sales team I call the people who book The demos and if I call them and say the right things that's going to positively influence my show up rate and so if my show up rate goes down the data driven decision would be make sure the calls are getting done properly audit them to make sure the scripts are correct how long is it taking us to reach them do we have a capacity problem in our sales team all the stuff that like reinforces that it's an execution problem with the current approach and to me like the 1% decision to use Tyler's verbiage is all right check check check check all the stuff I already know is being done to spec to my expectation the input metrics I know about are being performed properly and still the output metric is falling my show rate's dropping 3% and then two another 2% another 2% and it went from 60 to 40 I need some new inputs right like I need to figure out some new to do to move the needle on this number and that I think is where the critical thinking comes in where then you have to run an experiment of like let me go try something different to put into the machine to hopefully change this number and maybe I can stop doing something I used to be doing so I think it's like the DAT driven approach is my existing machine needs a tune up because probably something's not getting done right the intuitive approach is did that machine still ain't that great I got to go upgrade the machine so that that's the way I think about it Johnny love it I just want to highlight in in your frame there when you come up with those action steps based on what you're seeing in the numbers like you said for example you know we need to say this we need to contact them within this certain amount of time when you lay out all those additional things oftentimes there's an additional metric there yeah and that's the visibility piece that I was talking about so you might say hey we need to contact them within 24 to 48 hours do you have a scorecard that shows you how long it took you to reach out how many were within 12 hours how many were 12 to to 24 so on and so forth so that's the visibility iteration part that I was alluding to yeah dude your pyramid your pyramid's perfect right cuz I mean like without the visibility you're you're just taking shots in the dark the the interesting um interesting thing it's a newer Revelation for me that I learned from um from a few of these different guys is also though like instrumenting not just for is the activity being done and like how long does it take to to get it done which are the ones that most of us provide visibility for but also in a more manual sense is it being done right you know um because especially on things that are the The Human Experience you know people making phone calls people saying things like there's no substitute yes AI is getting better this is probably a temporary statement but at least as of today there's no AI that I would trust to like analyze a sales call more than a really good sales director like that kind of thing and so so it's just it's this fascinating thing where you could go you know 12 weeks down range on something on this theory of like let me get an SDR to call these people who are supposed to be showing up and without actually auditing the calls to figure out like what's being said and is the thing that I said they should say actually being done properly you could go down range three months and be like called everyone uh you know called them within 10 minutes guess this calling people thing doesn't work without actually doing the the the like the grunt work of auditing the calls every couple week spot checking stuff and like is the system you designed actually being done properly I think that's the harder thing to instrument for visibility because it's more manual but it's also just like this this crazy thing where all the easy numbers can look super green but if you don't actually audit the humans you could have built a machine that never actually saw the light a day because the thing that you said should have been done never got done right and then you're you're three months downrange no closer to solving the problem than you used to be so let me give you a a data driven corollary to that because I I've been seeing this a lot more as well and it's this concept that you call paired metrics which basically means that one metric by itself doesn't tell the full story you need a pair of metrics that to together allow you to tease out exactly what you just said so there is some cases where you can truly capture that as a metric there's other ones where you're to your point you kind of just need to do some manual review and then maybe in that review create a metric like you know I score this on a one to five scale for example um but a really good uh common use case on this is let's say you have a customer support team and one of your core metrics is uh how many tickets did you resolve in like a time period right well that could be super misleading if all of those customers are super unsatisfied yeah so it's like pairing the number of tickets with like average customer review score on that interaction right that's the pair that allows you to derive the meaningful Insight so it comes back to visibility right do you have the pair Johnny actually I I stole this turn of phrase from Johnny um you know he's right here so I got to give him credit but anyway um he called you've called it Johnny like two numbers that are in tension with one another right and so like like Tyler your example is is beautiful right because essentially like sure One support rep could handle 300 tickets a day but it probably ain't going to be very good right and so like that number would go up it would cause the other one to go down and then that same number of cases per rep right there's like this inverse relationship and it's really you're trying to build a Continuum to make sure neither side gets too far out of whack from one another um yeah I love it oh man Johnny you just just you just dropped the bait for two nerds to get into this conversation I don't know much I know I'm sitting here wondering how can I intervene we're in deep talking about sports that was great though oh so Tyler take us take us into the uh the company building mode I'm curious where where's LTV numbers go from here what are you what are you focused on and um yeah what do you see coming up over the next 12 months well what I really see truly comes back to the way that the company was built from the beginning and all the things that I've learned in doing it that way which is what I used to think was a services company that was going to transition to just pure SAS it's been on these calls and having the conversations with the customers that have led me to realize the experience that our customers are truly seeking and that experience I would actually call analytics as a service it's it's not actually to use the software and look at the graphs and set the filters and configure this and configure that they just want to be told what the data says that is the end goal what does the data say comes back to the data driven framework and really it comes back to the way that business owners think right I mean you guys could probably both agree with this right here on the spot but you don't want to spend your time looking at the data and looking at the graphs you want to be given the insights and the takeaways would you agree yeah dude I say it I say it all the time in the context of customer support like they don't want to talk to you they just want their problem solved right that's all it is exactly same thing and it's it's the same thing with data driven decisionmaking it's like the more you can reduce the amount of time and effort required to get to the insight the better so what I've realized is that yes I had to build a lot of this foundational capability to analyze data but for a lot of business owners their Perfect World experience is that they they never actually even use the tool at all they just get told what the data says now there's a lot of things that need to happen to get there and there will be a lot of intermediate steps along the way but what I've realized first and foremost is the experience I'm providing with those insights calls that needs to be a Cornerstone of the service on an ongoing basis meaning we could literally just be your analyst as a service we're going to use our software behind the scenes and also if you want to just use the software you totally can but a core offering is going to be this analysis as a service and when you think of it that way it has this really great long-term product development forcing function which is at some point couldn't the software kind of do that too couldn't it also analyze the data on your behalf find some of these insights and tell them to you proactively yeah it probably could especially with the rise of what's going on with AI well then at that point Tyler you don't you just keep better and better margins on your service you use it for you well but this is the thing though I because I've thought a lot about this and I this why I don't mind saying this publicly the competitive Advantage at that point would come from how good your analysts are it it doesn't even matter if you made the software publicly exposed because what's going to make the software do its job well is how good the analysts were that fed the intelligence of the software so I've realized that right now I'm kind of like the super super super user right I've analyzed all of the data I have 100% context no one can use this software better than me but if I end up with a team of 20 analysts that are like 80% as good as me at analyzing the data using the software and they're helping inform what else the software needs to do and we're capturing our brains and our way of thinking into the way that the software does its own analysis the day will come where the software can kind of stand alone and that to me is like the grand grand vision is I sit down at my desk I have a little device like this sitting on my desk and I say hey data what do I need to know that to me is the ultimate experience and in thinking in those terms it it makes the reverse engineered Pathway to get there super clear and that's what I'm working on right now dude very cool very cool um I think your point is wellmade on we don't actually want the data we want the insights from the data um one of my favorite vendors that we use takes our our monthly financials once our books are closed they do the analysis they run it through a model that they've written a book out you can buy into their methodology as a whole so you you probably have somewhere in you a book on how you in inside how you analyze your model for analyzing e-commerce data um so if you want to just teach it the analysts out there in the world the in-house ones could read it and be like oh man a great model but this company that we use has a has a book it's grave crab trees simple numbers 2.0 is the book and then they have a service where you say hey if we buy into that um model you can send your Clos books and they'll send back to you a the analysis the data itself but the really powerful part is an hour monthly call where they tell you what they're seeing based on the models they have no insights into like what's happening in the business they're just like hey here's how labor costs were affected here's how your sales cost to effect like just across the board give you some insights so I think you're you're right on point um at least from my perspective it sounds awesome it'd be what I want Matt probably loves tinking around with the daddy but never be able to get him fully out of the spreadsheets he he likes that part but um yeah I I love the insights like tell me what I need to know so I can go focus on execution so very cool Tyler hey I'll give you just a point of view on that Johnny because it's not all about the spreadsheets for me like yes I love tinkering with the data but T to Tyler's point I put a very high importance on objective third-party analysis right like I'm very close to the data most of the you know data changes the good ones or the bad ones in our business are Downstream of decisions that are made by Johnny Paige and Matt verlac right so we we also have the way that we see them and the context we see around them and so the biggest thing that I actually get from those calls is someone who's looking at our business as a spreadsheet not as something that our you know work and our the quality of our decision- making is tied up into it's like look the numbers don't have feelings like they're just the numbers this is what the data is telling me it's either correct or it's incorrect but this is the trend and it's just that clear objective analysis without all of the head trash that every entrepreneur ties to their numbers and their business like there's a huge Roi on just having that and so I think that's to me at least a big part Tyler of what you also provide is just the fact that like you're not tied up in their success or failure right it's just the analysis it's just the numbers this went up this went down here's where I should do absolutely I mean that that really at its core is what data driven decision making is all about yeah and you know to kind of put a bow on a lot of this discussion you can't do any of that stuff if you don't start with visibility and you don't realize what you need visibility into until you leverage what you have make decisions from it and then see where the gaps are and so for for many businesses where being data driven feels like an intimidating step it doesn't have to start with nailing the visibility the very first time come back to that story that I told earlier of that company that was kind of beating its head against the wall was scaling that that offer they were running into that wall and making decisions based on limited visibility and it became very clear because I was able to bring that perspective of heyy are you sure you guys are seeing the full picture here because if you saw what happened after the customer was acquired you might be making very different decisions and just having that voice in the room and maybe it can be you right now of hey we're trying to make a decision about this but each time we've made this decision in the past it doesn't really seem to be producing the outcome that we're expecting that's usually a sign that there's a visibility Gap and if you can start with that framework in your mind of get the visibility to improve the analysis so we can make better decisions improve the visibility so we can do the analysis to make better decisions that's really all it takes to get started being a more data driven company because being data driven is not like you either are or you aren't right it's how data driven are you and you got to start with what you have leverage it see where it breaks and then improve great points Tyler I'd love to shift gears a little bit because one of the I think you've just had a nine year you've got a 9-month-old at home you entered a new season of life like we talked about the Tyler that was grinding it out at his parents house saving up a bunch of money to get Runway the and you Matt and I are familiar with the hours and effort put into getting a business from zero to one and you did it not once but you did it three times before you got to a point where you are today with with LTV numbers um I want to talk a little bit about about the this term we call the integrated life like at SAS Academy our focus is not on just supporting a winning founder in the business but on supporting a winning human right that there's a there's a whole part of Tyler that shows up as a dad and as a husband and as a friend and I'd love to just like you know click on what's what have been some of the the highs and lows and lessons you've learned as you fight for I know that those are values that are super important to you as well and um I'd love to know what are some of the the mindsets and Lessons Learned along the way as you you fight for that balance and and integration between all the areas that you aim to show up as a 10 out of 10 yep in this new stage where you know there's a baby now and it really forces you to focus on Leverage I think more so than anything else because the thing that you lose some of in terms of like the currency that you have to play with is time right you just don't have as much of it as you did before and you can't just smash the work more hours button over and over and over again right once there's a baby that you want to be a part of their life and you want to be present for and also they're going to decide a lot of the time when you can work and when you can't you gotta plan around that from a leverage standpoint and one of the things that I've heard as a consistent theme with many of the entrepreneurs I know who became parents is that they all became better entrepreneurs after they had their first child and I see you guys nodding your heads and it begs the question of like well why why why why because you didn't learn anything new right it's not like you got smarter in fact you're probably operating at a mental deficit because you're sleep deprived half the time right so what is it to me it's just the realization that time is so precious and you need to figure out how to spend it on the stuff that really matters so I had to completely rework my schedule as you know no surprise on when I do work and when I don't and I had to really create those strict boundaries around where work begins where work ends and that's forced me to really think about from a leverage standpoint what's going to be the single highest leverage input that I can put into the business to get the most output and for me because I've been in this bootstrapped entrepreneur Journey for so long I've realized how much of what I'm spending my time on is just low leverage stuff that I shouldn't be and you know obviously this is like a huge Dan Martell uh Axiom of buying back your time and really taking that seriously I mean having a having a baby is the strongest forcing function can think of to doing that so you know whether it's hiring a nanny like we did to be able to create some structured hours where I can do Focus deep work but then also to deciding what I spend my time doing during that period you know am I writing social media posts am I doing customer support you start to list out all these things and realize if I only have this many hours I need to spend it here and here because that's going to be the two things that give me the most leverage in growing the business and so I think just really leaning into that and embracing it which for me has been going on podcasts it's been speaking to our highest end clients and learning about what they need to what they want the software to do and what they wish it could do and it's been because it is still mostly just me from a team perspective right now it's been only doing the things on the software side of things are strictly necessary that are going to move the customer experience forward that are going to allow us to charge more they're going to open the doors to new clients that we couldn't bring in before instead of just like tinkering on little cool features that before I might have just you know spent a week on because why not so all of that has been I think the biggest takeaway for me dude I love it you've actually shared a couple forcing functions for growth in our our commer ation today one of them is having having a kid right it's like a very clear new constraint for most people they hey I've got the values like I'm not willing to concede in either area I'm not setting down the Ambitions of what LTV numbers is going to grow into and I'm not setting down the ideals I have around what it looks like to be a the the dad and and husband that I want to be so the only thing that can change is I got to get better so you shared that I love you know having a kid is a is a huge forcing function to building more leverage but so was leaving the job without the clear what's next they're like let me just take the next step it's a lot of what a lot of people say they want growth but they don't like the uncomfortability that comes with the taking the step and being stretched and that's what having a kid does it's a forcing function of like oh my God I never knew I could be this tired and have this little time and I still got to get the thing done there's a really uncomfortable first couple of months where you're like all right I got to lean into this but you start to gain a since a new homeostasis you're like oh okay I got I got a new normal I can now I can deal at a whole another level and that's most hey if you don't like that game then you should punch out now and go get the job at Google go get the job at you know that's like that is that is the label on this journey is it never ever ends whether you are running a billion dollar company a million dollar company or you're starting from zero it is a series of that oh my gosh there's a new uncomfortable and I think they having a kid just a very easy moment to realize when did that start for me um and I think your your mindset and approach prior to having a a kid set you up to you know handle this season of life really well and I got no doubt there's another one just around the corner um a new new layer of Leverage and um an impact that you don't lean into um so love it man appreciate the share on that absolutely and and I I would just say as well that I think as much as possible as entrepreneurs we want to learn the lesson without the scar as much as we can right and having a kid obviously is like about as strong of a forcing function as you can get but that doesn't mean that you know if that's not on the horizon for you or that's something that you're not planning to do that you can't still take that same lesson and find other ways to create that forcing function yeah that could be you know for example joining a business Mastermind it could be getting a coach getting a mentor someone that holds you accountable but to your point what they're all going to have in common is pushing yourself into an area of some kind of discomfort where you have no choice but to adapt and I think too often as maybe like before making the jump or super early stage entrepreneurs it's scary to truly make it so you have no choice but to adapt and so you just don't leap quite far enough you're always playing it just safe enough you can kind of get away with doing things the way that you've always been doing them and it just hamstrings your ability to grow so much so I just want to really highlight that you can create those forcing functions at any stage you just have to be intentional and willing to create it so that you have no choice but to adapt that can be a hard thing to do oh 100 per. man I'd love to shift gears to one one final note before we we wrap up here uh at SAS Academy we say and we we hire our team the the vision that we constantly come back to to go back to the the NASA uh example earlier is we exist to help Founders find their perfect exit and some for some that means that they actually exit the company they sell it and they have lifechanging Financial outcome and they go on to go do the next thing for others that means that they were the only person riding software and now they get to hire a team and they're out of the day-to-day so there's like operational exits there's you know business Etc so there's a process of defining what that is for you but I'd love to know this whole how we met you know the way we interact on a regular basis is under the um vision of creating your perfect Desa so like what does that look like for you what what is what do you build in LTV numbers like why why go through the process of being stretched and building more leverage and what do you hope this turns into from a business standpoint because I really do think about it this way the mission of what is today called LTV numbers and the vision of the company that I want it to become in the future it's really evolved so much because of how closely I've been I think to the customer and to the customer experience it it used to be to answer the question how much can I spend to acquire a customer better than anybody else because that was sort of like the simplest version of that question but now it's to make being data driven accessible to anyone that is a vision that gets me so excited it draws on all of my past experience it draws on all of my past life in being an analyst in being a software engineer and being someone who was comfortable in the numbers but who has over the course of six seven years forced himself to learn business and realized that everyone who's in business just wishes that being data driven was easier because everyone wants to be data driven it's just a matter of can I or to what extent am I and making being data driven accessible to anyone is a vision that gets me so incredibly excited and for the first time ever as of earlier this year when I realize that I can see LTV numbers becoming a company that I run for the rest of my life and now I don't know that I will who knows but directionally correct I'm playing the infinite game and I really think that this company could meaningfully change the world of business because being data driven is hard it's very hard and to me it's a problem that I feel like I'm uniquely positioned to tackle and I'm willing to think in decades and not days and put in the time required to meaningfully solve this problem and so I know that if I can do that the company that I can create will create the business life that I would like to create which is making leveraging data analytics more accessible to anyone and allowing people to have those aha moments around leveraging data inside their business and I also know that this business can be so big that it can create anything that I want in my life for my family for you know the type of life I Envision for my kids and the places that we can go in the world and the things that we can do and the freedoms that we can have I I can see all of it living inside of that vision of building this company which I see being called Data driven LTV numbers becomes data driven as this Vision ultimately starts to come to fruition and man is that exciting to me I love it man go scoop that domain quick I have trat driven.com nice I love it I love it dude uh Tyler I said it from the first and I I mentioned it a couple times here today man we have this with saying we say winners are going to win and we get to work with a lot of people and a lot of our mission is to help the people who potentially don't have the winning mindsets or the habits and and support to be winners um I meant it from the first time we met man I think you're a winner whether it's going to be I I'm after a thorough conversation I'm really confident data driven becomes a thing man I can feel your passion and excitement around it so just appreciate you coming on here and talking a little bit about what drives you to uh you know to operate the way do I think there's so much around your mindsets and habits that others can learn from and um dude just super excited to uh to be along the journey and uh and supporting you as as you as you do some pretty exceptional stuff in the business and and just the way you operate in the family life so thanks man for taking the time to come on and Shine Your Light we'll have you back on I can't wait let's say for like six 12 months from now love to have you on again and uh get some updates on where LTV numbers is that but big things coming for you and and
