# Survive AI Bubble as AI Agency

The episode features an analysis of the current state of the AI industry, emphasizing the existence of an AI bubble characterized by inflated spending and investment.

## Core Thesis
The AI sector is experiencing a bubble driven by inflated investments, with risks similar to the dot-com crash. However, substantial usage of AI technologies in small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) shows promise for sustaining value creation. Businesses need strategic planning to navigate the bubble, emphasizing genuine ROI over speculative investments.

## Key Insights
- The AI industry may face a bubble, with heavy investments not matched by proportional gains.
- SMBs experience higher success rates in AI adoption compared to large enterprises.
- Companies are moving beyond early adopters, necessitating tangible ROI to justify AI investments.
- Transitioning to retainers and focusing on building critical client systems can create stable revenue streams.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Focus on assisting SMBs with AI adoption as they are more agile and achieve better results.
2. Shift agency models from one-off projects to retainer agreements to ensure steady income.
3. Begin AI projects on a smaller scale, building measurable ROI data to inform larger initiatives.
4. Engage in continuous optimization of AI systems for long-term collaboration with clients.

## Notable Quotes
> "There is a bubble. And really, the only move left on the chessboard for us as AI business owners... is to figure out what our moves are from here."

> "The problem is really where that value is being captured and if both sides are really carrying their fair share."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
By focusing on small to medium-sized businesses, our agency can leverage their agility to implement AI solutions effectively. Positioning our services as indispensable through retainers and partnerships will foster reliable revenue streams. Additionally, offering training and consulting services can help identify custom AI use cases, providing measurable ROI for our clients.
