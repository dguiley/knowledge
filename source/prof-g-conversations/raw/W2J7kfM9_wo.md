the Obama Administration swapped out five members of the Taliban who are being held in Gano for an American Soldier who' gone awall now that American Soldier deserved help regardless of how he went A1 it was a bad trade the Trump Administration out there the Obama Administration when they put 5,000 Taliban back on on the battlefield because they were in a hurry to make a deal anytime a government is in a hurry to make a deal all the other side has to do is sit back and let time work against them [Music] Chris where does this podcast find you I'm in my house in Vegas you live in Vegas I'm willing to admit that so let's jump right into it you tweeted uh recently as a lead former hostage negotiator in the FBI I will say with certainty that the level of manipulation by the mainstream media should be not be overlooked when we look back on what exactly led to this moment and you were referring to the failed attempted assassination Trump what did you mean by that well principally you know I thought about when I put that up and and also since in point of fact I believe the media professional instigates and the sort of across the board it's really become uh accepted uh in any interviews um somebody sticks a microphone in somebody's face and said can you believe so- and so said this about you and it's a little bit like I remember doing this when I was in college trying to instigate a couple of my friends and getting into a confrontation can you believe that he said that are you going to take that right you know this instigating that comes from the side and uh if we have some Reliance on the media overall we don't think of them as instigators you know then uh just like when I was with from my friend's ear people say to themselves yeah you know yeah that's right and it's it's it's an incitement unfortunately it's a they're instigating when I was what the FBI were preparing for um Gathering of the G20 in Canada I believe it was at the time and they're talking about the preparations for the predictable demonstrations and so in preparation for the crowd they said uh for the uh Gathering they said you you put a thousand peaceful demonstrators in place a thousand and then you just put six professional instigators around in strategic locations and it'll take a peaceful demonstration and turn them into a violent mob six people and I've really been thinking about this a lot unfortunately the media's professional instigators and they look for the opportunity pull gasoline on smoldering Co coals and hopefully turn it into a flame and and point of fact it's a contributing factor I like the framing there that there's sort of they're in the business of instigating or taking the heat up not t taking it down I would say that's the same as true online but even worse if I look at my comments in my feed on social media platforms it feels like it's a bunch of people in the third grade surrounding two kids who are barely even having words and then screaming fight fight fight and I wonder and I'm curious what your thoughts are that if I were a bad actor a foreign entity the gru or the CCP I would absolutely employ this strategy to just get us fighting with each other yeah well we do it it's kind of the the there are no Markus of Queensbury rules on International combat I mean the the intelligence agencies globally are always trying to stir up discontent in within the camps of the enemy to keep them confused so that they don't get rallied against us so let's get back to how do you think the US government should be negotiating with Nations at War what advice would you have Biden has essentially said that he's going to focus a lot of his energy on his remaining time on trying to end the war in the Middle East and bring the hostages home what advice would you have uh for him or generally speaking in the US as it tries to negotiate uh with Nations that they're uh they're at War everything you've been doing up to now has been stupid unfortunately argument has become a synonym for negotiation and it's a horrible synony it shouldn't be there people just want to make arguments and that's advocated principally by lawyers you know lawyers want to make arguments to call themselves negotiators we don't have any better models in many cases other than lawyers that make arguments and great negotiation is invisible so you don't see it the only time Biden never did anything uh foreign policy-wise that I was really impressed by and he did it very early in the administration uh so what government should do was not let the other side get caught off guard if you're going to say something they don't like and Biden was going to make a statement recognizing um uh the genocide of the Armenians I believe which is largely uh placed at the uh the blame was placed at the feet of the Turks and what he did was he let the leader of turkey know it was coming you know we're gonna say this you're not going to like it don't want you get caught off guard by it and the president of tury's response was remarkably muted and professional instigators in the media said can you believe he said that you know what do you what do you think about Biden saying his blame placing his blame on and uh he'd been warned in advance so he he wasn't he he wasn't upset about it it didn't turn into the a flame that the media was trying to get it to turn into the argument you know the kids around the other kids in the school yard going fight fight fight so and very few politicians have really taken a cue from that to at least if you're going to say something that your counterparts aren't going to like then don't let them get caught off guard at least don't Blindside it and I and I think that's the that's probably the first move International people want to be warned when bad news is come and it's one of the basic tenants of the Black Swan method dayto day you you know I might have something negative to say I want you to be able to brace yourself before I say it in advance how do I do that you don't feel attacked how you feel is I'm just trying to tell the truth again to make analogy to what's going on in the media and social media today there's a great seeking for truth there's truth Seekers and Truth tellers and a lot of people disguise these truth tellers are really just leveling accusations but some of the people who have been around for a longer time are really just you know let's stop the accusations let's start let's start thinking about what what's the truth here let's try to speak the truth and if you can say it in the other way the other side is not offended by then you're probably I try something you said sort of resonates or I think has relevance with relationships I've always thought that the thing that really puts a strain on relationships is not bad news but surprises like it's one thing when all right the Investments have gone really bad and you're in charge of the Investments but but what I think people get really upset with is they've been bad for a year and they've been getting worse you waited until now to tell me do you think a lot of this can be has relevance with personal relationships yeah absolutely um I I see all this is relevant to personal relationships um a negotiation is relevant to personal relationships we hear all the time never split the difference is a great parenting book I hear back from women that for the first time my husband it feels like my husband's listening to me and then so first of all what does it mean to actually listen and then secondly like how do we eliminate the surprises from the other side people are remarkably res and they're not getting caught off guard and it doesn't take a lot unfortunately people Blindside other people not out of bad intent because they don't know how to tell the truth or they're trying to fix the problem so that it never hits the other person so it's never uh is rarely is it as a result of a bad heart if you will these are mistakes of the head not of the heart because people just don't know you know it it if I could just warn you it was coming then you could brace yourself I want to put forward a thesis I want to get back to geopolitics and have you respond to it um I think that not only when you're negotiating you have to recognize you're not just negotiating on the current situation but you're setting a tone or atmospherics or incentives for future negotiations ab and the thing I just really bothered me about the Britney grinder deal was I thought I I personally believe the moment we cut that deal and traded it was Loosely called or accurately called The Merchant of death Victor bu that basically that day Evan gershkovich was taken prisoner that we created an incentive structure that we would trade quite frankly someone more I don't want to say valuable but that had more should have been in prison a lot longer that we just set up an incentive such that we guaranteed more um more Americans would be falsely imprisoned what are your thoughts well so first of all Britney grinder was absolutely entitled to have the US government come to her Aid yep uh as uh when I was the lead International kidnapping negotiator and Britney grer saying was an illegal detention as opposed to kidnapping there are differences but in any event uh no American citizen should be abandoned over seas no matter how they got themselves into it in international kidnapping people will mostly just do it ill-advised Behavior they were putting themselves in really bad positions trying to trade on uh a form of caderie internationally that was never there and I don't believe that if Britney gruner she may have made a minor mistake but um she's entitled to have the government come to her Aid and do everything he can for it so first first point there I'm Absolut in support of the government helping them so now let's get on to the stupidity of the trade once the instigators got going in the media then increased pressure on the Biden Administration cut cut a deal cut a deal cut a deal then then then it's a matter of patience when the other side's more patient than you are and the instigators are putting heat on you then they can lay back and I don't think the I think it was a poor tray I think you know and and I don't think the Biden administration's got the market uh is holding the Monopoly on bad traits uh the Obama Administration made bad traits the Trump Administration B made bad traits you know thought it was horrible that um I thought they beat us in the deal when uh the the awall soldier uh the Obama Administration swapped out five members of the Taliban who are being held in ganal for an American Soldier who'd gone awall now that American Soldier deserved help regardless of how he went AWOL it was a bad trade the Trump Administration out there the Obama Administration when they put 5,000 Taliban back on a on a battlefield you because they were in a hurry to make a deal anytime a government is in a hurry to make a deal all the other side has to do is sit back and let time work against it and so the the Britney grinder thing was no different um there was a bad trade and then the nature of the bad trade not the nature of the fact that the trade was made the nature of the bad trade is what encouraged the poor negotiation what sets up further negotiations you know one of my favorite movies Bridge of spies Tom hex love it um we engage in the same kind of traits and as portrayed in the movie The American negotiator uh depicted by Tom Hanks got the better of the other side and got the better of the other side in the Russians same type of trait it wasn't that the negotiations were bad it was how good were the negotiators at the table and not only did uh Tom Hanks uh character and forgive me for not remembering the real life name of the guy who I have tremendous admiration for he turned around and cut great deals with Cuba getting getting massively uh we we we we beat the hell out of the Cubans in the negotiations after the pay pay of pics so it's not negotiation itself that's the problem it's the level of ability of the negotiators at the table the negotiation everyone's talking about is the negotiation with Putin and the negotiation with Hamas right if I think of the two highest profile negotiations maybe that's true in American Centric lens but one with Putin you have an autocrat who's not worried about not being reelected and you have a nation that has just has a confidence an incredible ability to endure hardship and suffering you know it's just it's just I find in terms of Russian history it's shown it's pretty difficult to put pressure on Russia they don't scare easily they're willing to put their own people through a lot of pain and suffering here so um I'd love to get your thoughts there and then as it relates to Hamas I even see a bigger Challen in that is you're not even sure who you're negotiating with or how you even open lines of negotiation and who can even enforce the rules or outcomes of that negotiation I'd love to give your thoughts or get your thoughts on both of those uh Dynamics I would agree with some of what you said about Putin and Russia I mean I I think the guy does worry about getting getting reelected which is why he put so much effort into it um I don't think that Russians would agree if you said that the elections were rigged uh you know they sport him openly um he's a nationalist and Glo globally nationalists are gain a lot of influence um populist nationalist leaders you know that are that are a th% in favor of what's in the best interest of our country it's sweeping Europe uh it's the reason that Trump is as popular as he is um he's Pro his homeland uh Russia has shown the ability to endure what if they had to endure they've been invaded more times than they've invaded other countries they've been invaded by Japan multiple times they've been invaded by various European countries multiple times they've been invaded more than they've invaded other countries they've got they don't have the natural land barriers uh geographical protections the United States had we get the most envious geographical setup on Earth you cannot come at us without us either seeing you or you have cross some ridiculously difficult terrain can't come at us from the north east or the West can't come you know if you want to try to come at us from the south you got to work your way through Latin America it's not it's not there aren't great ports down there Russia on the other hand has got land bridges that makes it extremely easy to get out of their natural resources are not high I once saw uh I read at the beginning of the Ukraine war that uh somebody dismissively of Russia said Russia is just your gas station all right empathy how does that look to the other side I think that was McCain it it might have been all right so if that's true you're the leader of a country that your principal way to feed your people is an industry the entire world is trying to stop using so empathy is about not necessarily agreeing with the actions of the other side but understanding where they're coming from and being able to say it to them out loud nobody has uh you know the Western European leaders president of France showed up and and had audiences with Putin I promise you that all that guy did if they got a direct meeting with him was tell him why he was wrong as opposed to right so here's what your problems are you get invaded uh you got no natural defenses you're worried about whether or not you can feed your people you're worried about your people starving in the cold and the dark let's talk about what the problems are on a different solution nobody's approaching him about that so I think what he's done what Russia has done in regards to Ukraine is absolutely wrong uh uh war is an environmental catastrophe let Al on a humanitarian C catastrophe but a little bit starts with all right so here's here's your motivations here's why you're doing what you're doing now let's potentially talk about a different course of action because as soon as you start talking to somebody about what their motivations are getting it out in the open air it helps them clear their head and maybe see war is a short-term catastrophe whereas economic collaboration is a longterm solution so that kind of my take on Russia now and as as I continue to Babylon there's a massive amount of influence on Hamas who cut all the negotiations are currently going on through there some of the Hamas leaders are hanging out it cut yeah they're there and there's all you know if you really want to talk to Hamas even if you're an American Diplomat you're going to cut it so U there's ways to influence him the the the real difference in my view and uh I was listening to Jared Kushner giving an interview about the Abraham Accords and the problem with Hamas and why they didn't participate in the Abraham Accords and the pro Palestinian peoples will say well we weren't given a seat at the table you could have had a seat at the table if you'd have paid table stakes and table Stakes for that negotiation was everybody that comes to the the table gets to keep their job you cannot come to the table saying I'm going to put you out of business you have to agree that the other side gets to keep their job Hamas has not been willing to say the Israelis get to keep their job all the Abraham Accords all the Sunni Muslim countries had signed off to collaborate with Israel they all said you know what if you're willing to negotiate with me in peace and look for an economic settlement or we can R you get to keep your job and Hamas has not been willing to say that and it's not that they haven't been invited to the table they say refuse to pay the table stakes and in this case the table Stakes are when you say get to keep your job you mean saying that we're not going to we're we're not going to be totally 100% committed to Exterminating your people is that where you referring to as table Stakes yeah yeah you know and even in even larger terms that's the first time the United States has been willing to make that agreement when when the second Iraq war started and um it's it's easy to criticize it in the hset as a bad move and I'm not going to go there but I do remember President Bush giving it uh an address to the American people and saying this is the opportunity to bring democracy to the midle and what he didn't know that he was saying at the time was he was saying to all the Middle Eastern leaders none of whom are democracies if you my goal is for you to lose your job because you're not a democracy and you're gonna have to subject yourself to the whims of the votes just like all the Western European countries do and everybody else and you gota if you if you want to collaborate with us we're going to bring democracy to your country you're going to lose your job and that was a mistake so the other thing about the Brilliance of the Abraham Accords and the approach in that particular negotiation was the agreement you get to keep your job if you come to the table and negotiate with us a good faith and so it's obvious with Hamas but America has made this mistake a number of times in the past we didn't realize what we were saying I want to bring democracy your country your monarchy the person on the other side is here and uh I'm lose my job why should I do that well let's get back specifically to Biden has said he wants to bring the hostages home my understanding is there's still five Americans being held hostage I'm not even sure we understand there's proof of life or not but obviously it's a priority for you know American the American government to get those five hostages home let's go back to that what advice or what are the atmospherics here to try and successfully bring these folks home so first of all if I can say when I was a hostage negotiator our opening principles is war you can't negotiate in the middle of a riot or gunfight and it looks very much like the gunfight still going on so to expect effective negotiations in the short term in the middle of a gunfight you got to get the gunfight stopped now what's the inducement for you decide to stop the gunfight ultimately it's the people that are supporting them the economic harm of violence as opposed to the economic prosperity of peace and Hamas continues to stay in the gunfight because of the support they're getting globally you know they're winning the pr reward they're intentionally putting their People In Harm's Way I don't think we're getting accurate reports in the media of how upset the how tired the Palestinians are of Being Human shields for and getting their people killed you know they they got a hostage rescue in a residential area and all sorts of quote innocent people are killed by the Israelis that come in on the hostage rescue well how did those innocent people get placed In Harm's Way you know Hamas is in sacrificing Palestinians by the tens of thousands to gain World support and they and they're getting that world support so you know what what are the kids standing around them shouting and yelling there there's there's the Biden Administration their challenge in getting hostages back is is is calm the ranker that's blaming Israel for uh a current bloody conflict that they didn't start that begins to change the perspective of the leadership are they winning the pr War Hamas is winning the pr War right now that's what's keeping them engaged in what they're doing I'd love your thoughts on how to take some of these skills and apply them to your relationship with your spouse and then I'd love to hear do you have kids Chris I got grandkids you got grandkids okay I would love specifically to hear lessons to your younger self or a new father on how you can apply these skills to enhance your relationship with your your kids um wow uh okay where Did We Begin it was a lot of there's a lot of good stuff yeah it goes It goes from Hamas to more unreasonable third parties when we're talking about teenagers but let's start let's start with uh using this as a means of establishing uh better Rules of Engagement with your spouse well uh here's a problem with spouse and children uh We've conditioned them that we're not listen so parents and spouses we want to we want to flip over to either continue to ask our list of questions to make it sound like we're listening and interested um or given an advice and and a lot of moms start to report that the use of the Maring skill got their teenage daughters to talk to them for the first time in years so what's a typical interaction kid comes home from school how is your day kid answers parent goes immediately to the next course well what that makes a kid feel like is that they weren't listen to now a parent is taught show interest you know I got a checklist to show interest so I get back to my life it's like a a person in the media doing an interview they got a list of questions they're going to run through the questions they're not going to pay attention to the answers and then they're going to move on so how is your day kids been conditioning that Mom or Dad ain't gonna listen so they're GNA say fine or I forget because they're not going to get interrogated over that I forget is is is is the best one I forget what did do I forget and then move on well and the parent is like you know why won't my kid talk to me well you you you got your list of questions you ain't listening You' conditioned them that you're not going to listen the people in our family we've conditioned each other that were not listen so the tiny little 2mm shift that moms are telling us constantly how was your day I forget if you're going to miror that what' you say you forget not accusatory but to just repeat what the person said confirms that you heard and you listen and suddenly the child's shocked like wait a minute you actually paid attention to what I said and by the second time they do that suddenly the kids opening up all mom or dad is doing is married and just as we wrap up here Chris what do you think are the two or three things that young people should keep in their back pocket as it relates to negotiating whether it's for a salary or for you know a different type of job responsibilities whatever it might be what are are there any sort of go-tos you'd say look this is what young people get wrong a lot and they should remember whenever they're in a situation that involves some type of negotiation yeah you know um if if you can show the other person by saying out loud with their perspective is that seems like a a tange u uh inefficient but just repeating back to them what their perspective is is breaks law jams and you don't even here's the thing you don't even got to get it right if you just make the attempt the other side's going to feel your collaborating and and they'll correct you they'll help you get it right you you go into instantaneous collaboration and it doesn't matter what the negotiation is it could be with your boss it could be with your parent you know how they see things saying how they see it is not agree and you're going to find that a lot of your law jams are just going to disappear half of them half of them I promise you will go away the minute you start trying to repeat what you think of the side's perspectives Chris Vos is CEO of the Black Swan group and the author of the national bestseller never split the difference negotiating as if your life depended on it he previously served as a lead International kidnapping negotiator for the Federal Bureau of Investigation the FBI as well as the FBI's hostage NE assciation representative for the National Security council's hostage working group before becoming the FBI's lead International kidnapping negotiator Chris served
