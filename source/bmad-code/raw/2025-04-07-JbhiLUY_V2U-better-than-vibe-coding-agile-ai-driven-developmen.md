# Better Than Vibe Coding Agile AI Driven Development for Complex Apps

Published: 2025-04-07

This is going to save you time. This is going to save you money. And this is going to build something that can scale and grow and actually deliver results for you. And so, first, what is the problem with vibe coding? Well, vibe coding is a lot of fun. I do it when I want to relax and I don't have a serious project in mind and I just want to play around and see what I can push the AI to do, right? So, maybe I'm building a space shooter, for example. I vibe code it. I'm using Super Whisper, talking back and forth to the AI, having it tweak things, not really caring about the quality of the code, right? The code might just be a massive HTML file with JavaScript and 3JS, and I don't care about app structure, code quality. Eventually, it's going to go off the rails. You're going to ask it to do something very simple, and you're going to end up in this loop where it just fails over and over again. or maybe it fixes one thing and breaks something else and then you're going back and forth and next thing you know you've used up all of your cursor credits for a month and a day or two. But if you want to build something serious that you can build onto add features and build a complex application from the ground up or maybe you want to work in a brownfield environment where you already have an existing application where you're trying to use the agent mode to build something for you. You need workflows and you need some stability. What I'm going to teach you today is a method that can work for anybody. My name is Brian. I have over 20 years of experience in software development and the techniques and methodologies that I've learned over time from small startups to big enterprises that all of that works and can be applied to quote vibe coding or agentic coding with an IDE such as cursor. So what is this method that I use? Well, this is a breakthrough method and I call it agile AIdriven development. This takes the best pieces of agile, the workflow that I use on big teams or small teams that I still use to this day, but I apply it to agent personas to build an application that is maintainable and scalable, secure, and understandable where features can continuously be added onto it. So, let's first explain what the breakthrough method is and how you can put it into practice. And don't worry, I'm going to take you through every step along the way. This is actually going to be a multi- video series. This first video is going to lay the groundwork and show you how you can save tons of money by setting up your initial project plan correctly so you can then feed it into the AI agents and have it flawlessly build your app step by step and then I will show you how we do each of these keeping cost down and having fun along the way. All right, so this is the breakthrough method for agile AIdriven development. First of all, we're going to start with a business analyst. And this AI agent is going to do advanced thinking and help us refine our idea. So, what we're going to do is we're not going to even code, right? We're going to start with a business analyst. We're going to use the advanced thinking mode from different LLMs and we are going to just refine our idea and talk back and forth with this BA to elicit all the details that we can then flesh out our idea and hand it off to the project manager. The project manager is going to take that well-distilled idea from the BA and then it's going to do deep research. So you can use open AI or Gemini's deep research modes. They will analyze your idea. They will search the web. They were they will search for similar applications, styles, technologies and come back with a report or a PRD. If you ask for a PRD, a product requirements document detailing the application and what we are going to build. By knowing what we're going to build from the beginning to reach our MVP product, we have a clear roadmap and we'll be able to build it incrementally without massive changes along the way. We're then going to have the project manager ask us questions to further clarify things just like we did with the business analyst in the first step. We're then going to pass it off to our architect persona. The architect is going to take the output from both the BA and the PM and produce an architecture document. But we're going to clearly tell the architect, we need this to have everything decided and in place using our technology choices or the technologies that it recommends. with its advanced thinking mode. It's going to produce a very detailed document so that when we're then building the full project from end to end, it has all of the details that the agents need. So, this will have all the language choices, all the libraries that we're going to use, pages that we're going to have, if it's going to be a web app, the transitions, security, um, infrastructure, deployment, database, schemas, data models. By having it all spelled out here in this document by this AI architect expert, we will now have a technical road map to meet our end goal. So now once we have our architecture detailed, we're then going to pass it off to the PO or the product owner. In the agile workflow, the product owner is the one that's really responsible for producing the artifacts that it can hand off to a scrum master, which we'll hand off to next, and implement the vision of the project manager over time. PO is going to use advanced thinking mode again to come up with a task list. And what we're going to tell the PO is take everything from the architect, take everything from the PM and build a task list that is granular and sequenced in the exact logical order that very junior developers can take and implement one at a time, piece by piece to build up the functionality from beginning to end. not leaving out any steps, any manual things, any account setups, anything we might need to do to build out this application. The PO is going to take this and hand this off to the scrum master. The scrum master is again going to use advanced thinking. So, so far, by the way, all of this we can be doing outside of cursor, saving a ton of money, producing these documents, and I'm going to show you how. It's very simple and trust me, you do not have to even have a lot of industry experience to do this. This will save you so much time and honestly this can be the funnest part really piecing out what your application is going to do and how it's going to do it. But anyways, your scrum master is going to take the output from the PRD. It's going to take the architecture. It's going to take the task list. It's going to consider all of those and it's going to come up with all of the epics and stories to then hand off to the agents. So, what are epics and stories? An epic is just a collection of stories or a logical grouping of small granular pieces of work. A story is basically one of those tasks that we just talked about. We're going to have the story written in a way that it has all of the details that the agent needs to pick up one story in a new chat thread and that's all it needs in its context to build this phase of the application. So, it's going to have any data models that it needs from the architecture. Uh file locations, project structure, understanding and context from the PRD specifically to the one story it's done, what's been done before in previous stories. Each story is granular. So our developer agent can pick it up and implement it without having to look at other resources unless it needs to. That brings us to the last step, right? And that is the developer agent. Before we get to cursor, we're going to take all of our documents. We're going to convert them all to Markdown if they're not in Markdown already. And we're going to put them in our AAI folder. Once in cursor, we will then have our files, all of our story files, which are ordered, right? The AI agent is going to work on one story at a time. Some of these stories are going to be enabler stories where we might need to help the agent to save some money. Such as if we're going to use uh Verscell and Superbase, right? We might want to have the first story be set up an account, configure some environment variables, secure our secrets, etc., etc. Some of that might be doable by the ancient agent and some of that we might do ourselves, but that is all going to be laid out in the stories. The scrum master will handle all of that for us. So, we will also know step by step what we need to do and what we can let the agent do. Every time the developer starts a new story, it's going to go through this process. It's going to pick up the next story. We're going to start a brand new chat thread and tell the developer agent. It is going to then test the story. If the tests pass, it will then push it. If the tests do not pass, we will correct until the story is complete. And then we will continuously push updates. We are going to constantly build up tests for our hope application. It's a little bit more effort for the AI agent, but it is worth it in the long run. As you're building this application, you want to make sure that as you add in more and more stories and functionality, you're not breaking previous code. So, we'll keep building up a suite of tests, shooting for 80 to 90% test coverage, good test coverage, so we know everything we're building makes sense and continues to work. This works in industry, and I've tested this. This works with AI agents and it's going to work for us to build our dream project. In the next video coming very soon, I'm going to show you how I do most of this with Gemini and OpenAI to produce the documents we need for cursor and then how we set up Cursor to use these documents. It's going to be a fun one and I do recommend watching it. It will be out very soon. Think about this workflow that I've described and how you might even implement this workflow yourself. Now, what have I not said here? I have not said here anything about describing complex prompts or complex rules for your development agents. And that's because we're building this up from the ground up. So, you're not guessing along the way. You're not vibe coding, but you are having fun. You are vibing with the AI to riff on your project ideas and think about what it's going to be. But then you get a little bit more rigid. This is going to save you time. This is going to save you money. And this is going to build something that can scale and grow and actually deliver results for you and not be an unmaintainable mess. This is the way if you want to build anything from a very simple to-do app to a very complex SAS application with multiple services, complex frontends, mobile apps, all working together. This will work. And the next few videos are going to show you the exact way that I do this. So, we'll see you next time. My name is Brian. Please leave me a message in the comments and let me know if you're using something like this or if this has got your wheels turning. I would love to know what you think about this. And before the next video, give this method a try and see what works for you. But I'm going to show you really soon how it works. Uh we'll see you in the next video. Thank you for joining me again. My name is Brian. BM Mad Code. Good.
