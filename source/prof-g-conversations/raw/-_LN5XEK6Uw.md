you said the bad news is no external power in the end is going to defeat us but within ourselves if we can't overcome the kind of polarization that we're experiencing today that we may have real challenges we're a fractious people and that is our Achilles heel so what do we do about it I think in in times where we have overcome this fractiousness it's required a couple things we already talked about service and [Music] education Admiral where does this podcast find you I'm in uh pabra Beach Florida professor and I am uh headed off to New York City tomorrow got it so let's press right into it if you were to stack rank I mean there's it's sort of take a card any card in terms of conflicts around the world that pose a pretty serious existential threat how would you stack rank the RIS where would you focus given that the cruel truth of capitalism and any society as we have fin our resources how would you allocate our resources in terms of leadership kinetic power and attention in terms of the conflicts around the world yeah I probably won't surprise you by saying strategically the obvious Contender is China simply because of scale and size military capability and the Arc of their Ambitions which are significant president X tells us he intends to be the dominant Global Power by midcentury so i' put them kind of at the top of the Strategic stack I think however tactically operationally if you will of Vladimir Putin's Russia uh poses a significant Challenge and principally because he's in possession of a significant nuclear Arsenal 5500 nuclear weapons he's an impulsive indeed a reckless decision maker he is embroiled in a very difficult campaign in Ukraine uh and when I put all that together I worry about Putin's Russia as well I think those are the two at the top of the stack for me so let's let's double click on that my sense of China is that you have to take the second largest economy seriously they're obviously ambitious they take themselves very seriously for good reason an incredible story but my sense is they have so many domestic problems they're not looking for another crisis right now I'll put forward a thesis and you you you validate or nullify it the likelihood that they are going to go after Taiwan right now or um create another crisis I I just don't think he's looking to mix it up right now 40% decline in the stock market the GDP has largely been driven by the real estate industry which appears to have three and a half times the leverage that we did during the great financial recession aren't they going to kind of be dealing with their own their own issues for a while I 100% validate your thesis um I'll add to it president shei is watching Ukraine closely and what does he see number one he asks himself boy I wonder if my generals and Admirals are as bad as those Russian generals appear to be all trained in the same schools debacle number two he looks again at Taiwan is your thesis and he says hm I wonder if those Taiwanese would fight like hell the way the ukrainians have he doesn't know he's never been to Taiwan I've been there a lot I know Madame Sai the outgoing president I know William lie the incoming president I know his Armed Forces I think they will fight and they will fight hard and it would be a difficult Challenge and number three really to your economic Point uh president X looks in the mirror every morning and says my economy it's too big to sanction right H maybe it is maybe it isn't could we do a lot of damage would it hurt his effort uh a valiant one to get out of the irons that he created in the course of the covid in addition to the real estate overhang which I agree makes 0809 look like a walk in the park I'll add another one environmental challenges uh the cost to remediate damaged uh environment in China is Extreme and longer term the demographics of the nation are terrible principally stemming from their obsession with one child policy led to a lot of femicide led to a a real imbalance by the way not often discussed between men too many women too few in that Society so yeah China has a host of problems they're not 10 feet tall on the other hand they're not 5 feet tall they're more you know kind of 62 with potential we would ignore them at our Peril but we shouldn't overemphasize the near term threat let's talk about Russia's invasion of Ukraine what give us in your view the state of play and what the media is getting wrong what do Americans not understand about the about the war in Ukraine the word to use correctly is stalemate we've hit a real stalemate and Ukraine has become this curious combination of World War I kind of trench warfare you watched the movie 1917 and it feels like you that you could see Ukrainian and Russian Flags right now 100% % and at the same time you have this overlay of 21st century and pushing forward with artificial intelligence with above all the Drone and unmanned the Ukrainian armed forces have destroyed a third of the Russian Black Sea Fleet despite the fact that they have no warships they've done it with drones unmanned both in the air and on the surface so the war is a stal M and a curious combination of what's old and what's new I I think the Germain question for us is how does this end what happens and and the answer is uh I can answer it in three words I don't know nobody knows and I think we all need to be a little more humble about our predictive Powers but I'll give you my guess again using a bit of History I think it'll end like the Korean war did uh with static roughly where they are now and the portion of Ukraine that is in the possession of Russia probably ends up in the hands of Vladimir Putin that's awful on the other hand the quidd pro quo will be Ukraine that is allowed to join NATO joins the European Union is reconstructed I think it's not impossible to imagine a South Korea like Miracle occurring for Ukraine in that scenario so and anybody's guess where it goes in terms of what the media gets wrong um I think we are Under reporting on the uh efforts of the Europeans in the conflict as usual in the United States we tend to think uh we are the sole determinant of how things are going to come out all in capital letters the Europeans have put a lot of money a lot of effort a lot of diplomatic engagement a lot of pressure on the Russian economy with sanctions um the Europeans are a big part of this story that's why it would be a real shame for the United States to kind of walk away at this point um I think that's a part of the story that needs to be told more forcefully so you're Professor you understand military strategy your job you manage more assets people Capital Machinery than any CEO probably in the Fortune 100 what what are your takeaways from this what have you if you were to say this is how I would deploy kinetic power and human in intelligence all how would you approach a war differently having observe what's happened in Ukraine yeah I'll give you three things I've been thinking a lot about one is uh unmanned and and you know we we tend to use the word drone um really unmanned vehicles are from space satellites are unmanned vehicles to uh high level long dwell drones where that word is correctly used generally to Tactical unmanned vehicles that can be as small as a pair of glasses to surface unmanned Vehicles like the Israelis are using in the tunnels against Hamas to surface and subsurface unmanned Vehicles going against Naval power um that moment is rising number two um artificial intelligence um the ability to knit those unmanned systems together is on the beach at Kittyhawk right now but it's moving very rapidly and the third is Special Forces the effects of Special Forces and here I don't mean just you know Navy Seals Green Berets and their equivalents I'm talking Elite smaller teams cyber Warriors are special forces I kind of think of it as a Triad um you and I grew up thinking of the Triad as uh missiles from the ground Minutemen uh submarines and longrange bombers that's a strategic nuclear Triad this new Triad of unmanned artificial and cyber and Special Forces is the new Triad of warfare and we're seeing it on display in Ukraine so does that mean we're going to start instead of West Point we're going to have some version of MIT absolutely and it's time we did we by the way as you know we just created a space force I think in the next within the next decade if not sooner the space force will begin to bring into it artificial intelligence the space force as we think about it unmanned operation everything we just talked about and to do that I think you do need a new Academy each of the current service acmy have sliced programs that do some of this uh but it's really time to recognize we're uh at the Battle of adun court again meaning uh suddenly English longbowmen Slaughter the French knights in their in their thousands at that battle this is the Henry V F battle it it we are at one of those moments in Warfare we're going to need to adopt not only our systems as you point out Professor but also our training our education our culture in the military are all going to have to change you know it's it strikes me in the corporate world great companies always point to their culture it strikes me that it's it take that times 10 and that's that's what the you know that's what creates winners and losers in Conflict talk to me about how the culture of our us um armed services has shifted over the last several decades I mean we always say we have the best fighting force in the world and I I still believe that and it creates I think a great deal of comfort for Americans how has the culture shifted talk about human capital who do you look for uh when you see someone you're obviously in the business of trying to figure out who should be in leadership and who doesn't uh come into leadership what is the culture of the different branches the culture of the Navy how it's shifted and and what you look for in young men and women in terms of leadership yeah it's a huge question let me let me pick on a couple of parts that you raised there um first the overall culture of the Armed Forces remains strongly patriotic um deeply committed to the nation um deeply committed to the idea of serving something larger than themselves and and by the way let let's not forget over the last 20 years um we became a highly blooded Armed Force uh we were engaged in active combat in Afghanistan and Iraq um Afghanistan NATO Mission I commanded 150,000 troops in combat there so point one the Armed Forces remain highly patriotic and I think fairly well respected those ratings have come down to about 60% that's still stronger than any other American institution the Congress is around 10% for example so I think patriotic and well respect Ed point two of the culture is experienced um when you go into a military unit today be it an aircraft carrier a Fighter Squadron a a nuclear submarine Above All Army and Marine Corps units you find so many of the midlevel and higher level both enlisted men and women and the officers who had significant combat experience in Iraq and Afghanistan and then point three because of what we're talking about now because they are students of their profession which is a part of culture recognizing that you a professor you a Dean you you're part of the the academy um people in the military feel the same they feel it's a profession and as they watch with Professional Eye to what's happening in Ukraine as we just discussed the culture is innovate we've got to change we can't just keep doing it it the same old way so I think those are three things that are very much at the heart of the military culture really from top to bottom across all the armed forces in terms of what we look for because that's our culture what we want our people who are willing to take a lot of personal risk not be paid a great deal of money um be willing to deploy for long periods of time away from their families are smart enough to innovate um are willing to be part as I said before of something larger than themselves that's a hard group to find and we are as you're probably aware having some challenges recruiting right now for the Armed Forces not so much officer ranks but for our enlisted men and women um most of the services missed their recruiting targets last year um down about 10% first time in a long time um number of reasons for that but the principle one is a booming economy I don't need to tell a uh a professor at the stern school about it um and it creates very low unemployment and so the military has to compete with that and many of these young men and women in this High School cohort are either too obese um have mental health issues have been arrested have used drugs that's 75% of the graduating cohort from America high schools so that's a significant challenge to then find the right set of them and convince them to take on this argu us career in the military it's just so interesting because when I was growing up there was a group of people who were just intensely patriotic who went on to Annapolis or West Point or you know the Air Force Academy and they were sort of the elite of of the elite they were smart they were they you know there was there was that guy who was a great athlete and a great student and it felt like a quarter of them were Bry you know they they just attracted incredibly and then on the enlisted side quite frankly it was like the last stop it was well I don't know what I'm going to do with my life I don't have a lot of options I'll join the Army and you hear these statistics it's such a upsetting story about America that we're not producing a youth that can defend our Shores do you have any thoughts about and I know this goes and I I know you've been and we'll come back to this but you've been mentioned a great deal times in terms of potentially holding a federal office what long-term Investments do we need to be thinking about in terms of our youth that at a minimum we have a robust fighting force that can defend our Shores I'll give you two or three ideas um one is we need to do more to incentivize and celebrate the idea of service and by the way this is not confined to the Armed Forces there are a lot of ways to serve this country and we need high quality people who are diplomats CIA officers Peace Corp volunteers Teach for America volunteer for America um our police firefighters EMT there are a lot of ways to serve the country I think we are underweight in incentivizing that with taxes educational benefits but Above All We Are underweight these days in celebrating it in particularly the non-military we we do a reasonably good job these days with thank you for your service we had to broaden that whole concept and create more of an idea of what it means to be a citizen and what are the positive incentives that can come out of this business can help at this and and many firms do as you know try and hire veterans that needs to be broadened in my view to hire those who are are serving in in the in the very broad sense of the term um number two uh near and dear to both are Hearts I've been a professor I've been a Dean um you're a professor education and here that's a much longer conversation you and I could have about what's wrong with higher education but what's wrong with our high schools what's wrong with our elementary schools I I'll give you just one example I'll pull out of my pocket this super computer called an iPhone that I carry around and I would invite people to consider what age do we place that super computer in the hands of a child the answer is about 10 years 10 and a half years old we provide zero education essentially for how to manage that device um that's an example within the broader question of Education of what we need to be doing with youth as they're coming along and the third one and there's no easy way to get at this but it's physical fitness mental health resilience back in the 60s uh even before you and I went through high school but back in the 60s under John F Kennedy there were a number of programs that really focused on those aspects of the youth and I think we're uh sadly uh underinvested in in those kind of programs as well so it's physical fitness it's educ ation and its service I think are are somehow part of the prescription do you think that mandatory national service is a good idea I do not if what you mean by that is mandatory military service what I expand it out to healthcare Senior Care Peace Corp basically what Israel does yeah I think that um we are very close to needing that um I would before we jump into that which would be a huge undertak for the nation I think there's a halfway house which is creating more incentives that would encourage that broadening that concept if you will instead of the GI bill that we remember a service bill that would um incentivize people to come in if that doesn't get us moving in the right direction I'm willing to consider the ideas of national service if they are broadly applied not just the military we'll be right back so let's use national service as a segue back to our tour around the world and talk about the war between Israel and Hamas uh it feels to me one group of people's fighting for their nation and their existence and the other is fighting for I mean they're both pretty committed fighting forces it's it's different than Russia and Ukraine you know I would argue I'm I'm obviously very pro- Israel but they're both very committed fighting forces and you know you want to talk about a a clash of cultures but summarize if you will the the the atmospherics there where the conflict is and do the same sort of analysis on where you think this might head first and foremost uh Israel vastly overmatch Hamas militarily that's Israel is not facing in any sense an existential conflict Hamas is uh and at the end of this Hamas which we need to recall is a terrorist organization that perpetrated unbelievably violent horrific acts on innocent civilians deliberately so I'm uh I have I have criticized the Israeli Defense Forces for the levels of Civilian casualties but there is a world of difference between trying to avoid civilian casualties which the IDF does and trying to inflict civilian casualties which Hamas did and continues to do and continues shamefully to use civilians as a uh as human Shields um where will this go um Israel has destroyed at this point by my estimate I'd say about half of the combat power of Hamas uh about a third of their leadership they're closing the net around what remains to the south in and around Rafa Israel has some hard work to do in deciding how to uh separate the civilian from the military population no easy way to do that going to have to use uh cordoning closing gradually as I say a noose around Hamas using Biometrics to identify peeling out the young military age males screening each of them a lot of hard work ahead and you've got to create sanctuary for the 1 million or so gin these are enormous tasks um when those tasks are um are are underway and that'll be a twomon process then and only then can Israel really close the switch on what remains of the combat in Gaza so I think you're looking Scott at two to four months of significant combat activity now break break we're on the cusp I think of a probably six week ceasefire that's been generated by needs on both sides Israel to accommodate International opinion Hamas because they're losing so badly um I think we're going to see a six week or so I think we'll see some hostages exchanged and in that period of time perhaps there's uh a level of uh negotiation that can follow that I'll give you one Theory would be the Hamas leadership um some of them are allowed to escape if you will the way the PLO left uh at the at the end of the inata um some level of Israeli control in the Gaza but joined by some other group perhaps Arab League perhaps United Nations perhaps some combination of all three uh and at that point you can begin trying to the principal task from a humanitarian in perspective of reconstructing some form of life in Gaza where by most accounts 50% of the infrastructure is destroyed so not a pretty picture but I think the next action step here is probably a ceasefire let the parties step back exchange some more hostages and at that point I think you you can reset the table somewhat so this plays to your strengths but my sense is that Biden doesn't get enough credit for immediately deploying two carrier strike forces and that these strike forces have effectively to date cauterized this from becoming a regional conflict that people don't appreciate um just how much we invest and the return on that investment is that we can deliver unprecedented levels of Firepower within days anywhere what's the role that the carrier Strike Force play here uh you correctly categorize it and the first question a president typically asked in a crisis is where are the carriers um these are unmatched Machines of War 100,000 tons 5,000 people 80 combat aircraft it was a clear distinct understandable signal to Iran to cease and desist now the Iranians being the Iranians um didn't immediately bring everything to a halt um and the houthis have been throwing some missiles at our troops and loocking down some aspects of Red Sea Commerce and we've seen radical Shia militias U launching attacks on us uh positions in Syria tragically killing three service so it's not perfectly clean but what we haven't seen is Iran unleash Hezbollah which has 130,000 service to service missiles and is an existential threat to Israel we haven't seen Iran uh shut down this stra of Hormuz uh we haven't seen Iran uh use its military capability against the United States I would argue a significant part of that was the presence of not one but two nuclear powerered aircraft carriers plus don't forget expeditionary Strike Force amphibious Readiness group that's 2,000 US Marines plus a couple of hundred Air Force aircraft in the region in and around Goa Bahrain um you know this network this Alliance we have is powerful and then you can use those carriers to jumpstart particular areas and I think uh President Biden used them wisely in that way at the beginning of the crisis that's part of why it hasn't spread into a a wider War you said something in front of the US Chamber of Commerce that really resonated you said the bad news is no external power power in the end is going to defeat us but within ourselves if we can't overcome the kind of polarization that we're experiencing today that we may have real challenges how do you think we overcome this type of polarization I I agree with you if this was a horror movie The call is coming from inside of the house how do we reunite if you will or or at least diminish this threat from within yeah and just to to pick up the threat piece of it before I come on to the the better stuff all the things we talked about the mid Middle East and and things we haven't talked about North Korea and China Taiwan Russia all of that well within our means to handle the United States of America we were this vast Continental power protected on both sides by oceans benign neighbors North and South remarkable Innovation education natural resources oil and gas we've got it all except we are a very fractious people we always have been right I mean if you look at our history we declare independence in 1776 We can't agree a constitution till 1789 13 years later then we have the Shay Rebellion the whiskey Revolt the Civil War we're a fractious people and that is our Achilles heel so what do we do about it I think in in times where we have overcome this fractiousness it's required a couple things we already talked about service and education U one particular place I'll hit on because you and I are both Educators I think community colleges have an enormous space uh for good in the United States it Community College is where education really ought to be free it largely is um with community colleges you can create a true middle class that can find its way to uh a a meaningful life in the middle um so education and service we've already discussed I think third and most obviously its leadership it is finding and electing candidates who are willing to work across the aisle that's what's really hamstringing us right now and by the way a big part of the problem are the political parties and personally I think it's time we started thinking we the big we all of us about particularly those of us who are kind of in the middle be thinking about are the Republican and Democratic parties as currently constituted um serving us well you know we act like somewhere in the Constitution you know article XX it says there shall be two political parties one shall be Republican the other shall be Democrat hey we didn't start that way we started with wigs and Federalists we had nationalists we've had the star party we've had the Progressive Party the actual name of Teddy Roosevelt's party we've had a lot of political parties I think it's time to start exploring what a new political structure would look like it'll require three things a charismatic leader money big money a Michael Bloomberg kind of money and it'll require ideas what are these Central ideas that we can all roughly agree on and you're a master of polling and and looking at statistics you know this very well across the big spectrum of issues you can build pretty quickly a 60% consensus in America we just need money ideas and the right person to lead that and I think if we hit those um things could change and by the way I just wrote a novel about all this called 2054 as in the year 2054 and it is a period of time in which Republicans and Democrats are gone but my sense of the history political parties and democracies is we always get very excited and it makes a lot of sense for additional parties and usually the vision is for the party to be less extremist to be a Centrist party would a more effective way of getting to the same place be reform around djerry mandering and ring Choice voting and final five such that quite frankly we just had more moderates I I I see the problem as just so deep red and so deep blue in the election system where we have kind of the crazy are the crazies basically show up and determine who is going to be our elected leaders they haven't served in the same uniform the way they did in the 50s 60s and 70s so there's literally no connective tissue and nothing gets done couldn't we get to the same place with uh voter reform I think uh in particular rank order voting it could be an enormous part of this and and we seen recent examples of that in a couple of the states um I think that yes I'd be willing to consider all of those um and that could be part of um an idea a set of ideas moved by a charismatic leader or two money and um and and if not an entirely new political party A system that um rewards the kind of centrism you're talking about I'll close with this very practical example I spent five years as dean of the Fletcher School of Law and diplomacy at tus University I lived in the People's Republic of Massachusetts the most liberal state in the country who was the governor the whole time I was there was a republican Charlie Baker who was consistently voted the number one governor in the United States by his peers we can find these leaders and if we can do the Tactical things you talk about terrific if not it's time to go after the Strategic framework which is the two political parties so you referenced your book uh 2054 you envision a future where we have artificial intelligence that leaders don't understand and can fully control in the United States right for civil war how realistic do you think that is and what what do what sort of threats or opportunities do you see AI presents to the nation uh I think it's unfortunately quite realistic and however I did not write the book as predictive fiction I wrote it as cautionary fiction and in this case I worry about AI in particular because it can do three things very well none of which will surprise you one is it can deep fake us and and lead us down the wrong bolt holes number two is it can introduce significant economic disruption as uh tranches of workers are displaced by Ai and thirdly it can become a kind of a false god that provides um answers that are dangerous to us as in they click into our own views uh in ways that that move us on mass all three of those things worry me so admirable your name pops up regularly you were vetted by uh secretary Clinton as a potential vice presidential candidate you were interviewed to be part of Trump's cabinet and the most recent speculation that's coming across my screen is that uh at a democratic convention if in fact they feel that Biden is not up to the task if you will for for a variety of reasons that Governor Whitmer is drafted and you are the VP pick how real is that I mean are you you're out obviously talking about your book so you can use that as cloud cover for being on my podcast I came on to talk about my book but are you interested in if you will laying the groundwork sort of ready to serve in a federal capacity should the opportunity serve uh well first of all my name is stabus which is too long to fit on a bumper sticker and uh you haven't met me but I don't meet the height requirements I'm uh 55 on a really good day so I'm I'm not that Admiral out of Central Casting and I'm I'm not a political actor so no I am not outlaying the groundwork to do anything and by the way yes I was vetted for vice president by Hillary Clinton and I was offered to Cabinet post by Donald Trump I think that is two bullets whizzing by my head at really close range um I am all about serving the country but I think the path for me to do so is not through elective office so last um last question here Admiral you uh serve uh you've served in the agency of something much greater than yourself that's that's how you have made your career and I would imagine it's been sort of the centerpiece of your life what advice a lot of young men listen to this podcast and most young men are trying to find their way what advice would you give your younger self what advice do you give to young men who come into your office and say you know I'm not entirely sure I don't this meaning my my youth manhood adulthood is harder than than I thought it was going to be do you have any sort of you know advice to your younger self or advice to young men in terms of what has held a test of time in terms of truisms or principles yeah I'll give you two very practical things and one uh philosophical thing um the two practical things are one is stay physically fit um it gets harder and harder as you get older and older it is the gift of Youth it is the burden of old age stay physically fit not just because you'll look better in a speedo but you will do much better uh in terms of your mental acuity your energy level the decisions you make the way you are around people physical fitness really matters um find time every single day to work out uh number two uh read read endlessly you are what you read the most important day of your educ ation is the day you graduate from the stern School of Business and Professor Galloway no longer tells you what to read That's when your education begins because you're the one that gets to pick it and you ought to be reading voraciously both fiction and nonfiction so I'd say read read read and work out um the philosophical thing is find time for service find time to serve others and that can be as as big as taking a commission in the Navy and banging around on a Navy destroyer for four years or it can be as small as making the persistent steady commitment to to go to a Food Kitchen every single day for a year or two small tactical contributions of service I think those three things make people not just young men but people make people better so strength reading and service Admiral James stus is a retired fourstar us naval officer he is currently partner and vice chairman Global Affairs of the carile group a global investment firm and is chair of the Board of Trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation admiral stabus has published 12
