# How to START Client-Magnet YouTube Channel

Published: 2025-10-28

If you want to use YouTube to generate unlimited clients for your business, I'm going to show you exactly how to start from zero and build a channel that attracts the best clients you've ever worked with. And that's because nothing pre-ells your services and makes people desperate to work with you more than YouTube. But here's what nobody tells you. YouTube for client generation is completely different from entertainment YouTube. You don't need millions of views. You don't need to go viral. In fact, some of the most profitable business channels have well under 10,000 subscribers and they still generate multiple six to seven figures in client revenue. The secret is that client focused YouTube is all about attracting the right 100 viewers who become your next 10 high ticket clients, not the wrong 100,000 people who are never going to buy from you. In this superpacked video, I'm going to show you all my secrets to making the exact kinds of videos that attract high-paying clients the best, how to move them from YouTube into your offers, and the mistakes that all new channels make that waste time and destroy your credibility. This influencer with over 2 million followers couldn't even sell 36 t-shirts to her massive audience. Meanwhile, smart service businesses are using their tiny YouTube channels to make six figures in client generation. So, what's really going on here? The painful truth is that most business owners are building the wrong kind of audience online. You know, one that never moves beyond passive viewers. After helping hundreds of service providers fix this exact problem, I've identified the four critical principles that transform audiences into paying clients. skip these and you're just going to be making the same expensive mistakes that are going to burn you out and cost you profits. So, I actually learned this myself the hard way. Back in 2011, I started this graphic design podcast with a few of my designer friends and we got lucky. We were early enough to the podcast game and we used the right keywords in our titles. So, we actually hit number one when people searched for graphic design on the podcast apps. And we were pretty stoked about it. Our audience grew fast. We had thousands of loyal listeners and we even got invited to some really big design conferences. We had our own booth. We met our fans. It was pretty awesome. Just one small problem. We weren't making any real money from it. The thing is, our entire fan base was other designers, not business owners who might hire us. But when I finally pivoted over to YouTube years later, I did it completely differently. So instead of creating content for my peers, I focused entirely in making videos for business owners who might actually want my services. And guess what happened? For the first time, I started getting real clients and serious money directly from my content. And that's exactly what we're going to be building for your business today. The first mistake I see service providers make on YouTube is waiting for their channel to grow enough before offering anything they can actually charge for. They think, you know, I'll grow my audience first, then I'll figure out how to monetize it later. I would much rather see you start selling something now, even if it's just your time as a consultant. Don't worry if your business isn't properly set up or your offer isn't perfect yet. You can always refine it and improve it as you go. Even something as simple as a website audit or a strategy session gives your viewers a clear way to work with you. And that's important because knowing your service, that's going to shape everything else about your channel. Your service decides what videos you make, who you want to watch them, and what search terms you want to use. So, think about it. If you're an accountant who helps online stores with their taxes, you should make videos about tax tips for people selling stuff online, right? Don't make videos about basic tax stuff for just anyone. So yeah, what you sell shapes all your content, but how you talk about what you sell matters just as much. And that brings me to the second principle. I see this all the time. As soon as they press record, they somehow switch into business robot mode. Their helpful business videos turn into stiff corporate presentation. So I found this financial planning channel by Andrew Song, and I want you to listen to how he attempts to explain a fairly complex idea. FPNA is a set of planning, forecasting, budgeting, and analytical activities that support a company's major business decisions and overall financial health. >> And I get it, this is a complex topic, but presenting it in a super buttoned up, you know, professional way doesn't help it go down any easier. Believe it or not, the corporate approach doesn't usually impress clients the way you think it does. Being relatable works much better here. And the fix is really simple. Just talk like you're explaining it to a friend over coffee, the way that Sean Hakeim does here. >> If accounting is focused on everything in the past, then FPNA's role is to focus on everything going on in the future. >> Same topic, but totally different vibe, right? Be relatable. Use analogies. Share stories about people that you've helped. Be honest about what's hard or when you've messed things up. You don't need to sound professional. People hire people they trust, not just another buttoned up suit. So instead of, "Our clients experienced significant improvements in conversion rates, say something real like, you know, I once fixed this mistake on a client's website and their sales doubled in a month." See what I mean? One sounds like a boring brochure. The other sounds like helpful advice from someone who knows what they're doing and has done it before. So that's what to say. But who exactly should you be talking to in your videos? This is another place where a lot of channels go wrong. Knocking yourself out trying to make viral content that isn't aligned with your service will grow the wrong audience and wear you down in the process. So, forget about chasing trends or worrying about making mass appeal videos. Seriously, a video with only a 100red views targeted at the right people is worth way more than 10,000 views from the wrong audience. This is David Jackson. He's a student in my YouTube clients academy. And David runs a pretty new SEO channel specifically for dentists who want to rank at the top of Google searches. His videos get under 200 views each. Nothing crazy. But here's the good part. He signs multiple 5 figureure clients every single month. How? Because he's laser focused on exactly what his ideal clients are searching for. He doesn't make general SEO videos or content for other SEO experts. He makes videos with titles like local SEO guide for dentists. And these videos speak directly to the exact people who can hire him. But even with the right audience watching your videos, there's one more critical element that you need to get right. So just imagine you're struggling with your website. You find this amazing YouTube channel with super helpful tips. You watch video after video learning all this useful stuff, but after binge watching for hours, you have no idea if this person actually works with clients or not. There's no mention of that anywhere. and you'd love to just hire them to fix your problems, but you just don't even know if that's an option. Is this just a helpful YouTuber or someone you can hire to do it for you professionally? Trust me, you don't want people to wonder that about you. You want to be very clear that yes, you're bringing the heat in terms of free content, but if you want to go deeper and get more help from me, this is exactly how you can do it. And that's what I call your YouTube toclient bridge. So, there's three main steps to building your own bridge. First, make semi-frequent casual mentions of your clients and the things you've done for them throughout your videos. You can say things like, "I helped a client with this exact problem last month, and then after implementing the strategy, they saw a 43% increase in leads." Or, "This is the most common resume mistake I see with my coaching clients." Remember, David, this is a real example from one of his videos where he does this perfectly. This is one of the pediatric dental clients that we work with in Overland Park. >> He then goes on to talk about the 400 phone calls that he managed to get for that client. These little mentions plant the seed that you do this professionally without it ever feeling like a sales pitch. They just help your viewers make that mental leap from this person gives good advice to this person does this for clients. Maybe I could be one of those clients. Step two to building your client bridge is using strategic call to action videos. So about every four to five videos, feel free to end it with something like, "If you want help getting this done faster, click the link below to book a consultation." And step three is probably the easiest thing of all, and that's making it simple for ready to buy viewers to reach you. So you just want to add your website link prominently in every video description with some attentiongrabbing text like, "Want to work with me? Click here to book a consultation. Also, you want to make sure that your channel about page clearly explains how to hire you too. Last year, I analyzed over 500 service business YouTube channels to find out which videos were actually bringing in clients instead of just views. The results were clear. Most business owners are wasting time in video formats that just don't convert while the channels generating consistent leads are leaning into a few very specific types of videos that I'm about to show you. These aren't just any videos. They're strategically designed to move viewers through your funnel from complete strangers to paying clients. But before we dive into the best types of videos to make, we need to understand how YouTube really attracts clients in the first place. What I've discovered after studying hundreds of service business channels is that the videos that attract the most clients all follow what I call the client attraction triangle. First, great videos solve the same problems that your paid services solve, just in a more DIY format. So, if you're a Facebook ad specialist and your video is how to set up your first Facebook ad campaign, you're attracting exactly the right people who are already interested in the problem you solve. Second, your videos have to naturally show your expertise, not by bragging, but by just having the answers that people are searching for. And third, this is where most businesses miss the mark. They bring you into the picture as a real person with real experiences. So, when I started sharing client success stories in my own journey instead of just reciting facts, that's when YouTube really started working for me. That human element is what's going to put your videos a cut above anything that AI could ever create, making you someone viewers feel like they already know and trust and actually want to work with. Now, certain types of videos hit this triangle better than others. And it really helps to organize them based on where your viewer is in their journey toward hiring you. Every buyer for anything goes through three separate stages. So, they start in the awareness stage where they're just starting to figure out they have a problem. Then they move on to the consideration stage where they're actively looking at different ways to solve their problem. And finally, they reach the decision stage where they're deciding who to buy from. So, let's start at the top of the funnel with those awareness stage videos. So, these are perfect for people who are just starting to realize they have a problem, but they might not be actively, you know, looking for someone to hire yet. And the first type that works incredibly well here is the simple talking head video. So, don't let the simplicity fool you. These can answer FAQs, explain concepts, and establish trust quickly with new audiences. Take Dr. Dre for instance. Not this one, this one. She's a dermatologist who gets thousands of views with these really basic, low production videos that she literally films on her bed most of the time on topics like how to heal dry cheeks. And I love her channel because it proves you don't need fancy equipment or any kind of a studio setup. People are searching for these problems all the time and she's right there with the answer. And a lot of these viewers are then going to check out her other content and eventually become patients. Why? Well, because she's hitting on all three points of the triangle, solving the same problem she treats professionally, demonstrating her expertise naturally, and bringing her personality into the videos. The next big winner at the earnest stage are tutorials and how-to videos. So, these are basically step-by-step guides where you show people exactly how to do something related to your service. Take True Green Lawn Care UK. They made this video called the proper way to mow your lawn. that's brought them tons of clients. Here's what happens. People watch it and they think, "Okay, cool. I'll try that out myself." But then they realize, "Wow, there's actually a lot more to lawn care than I thought." And guess who they end up calling? You know exactly how this works because we've all done it, right? We've watched a DIY video and then halfway through we thought, "Yeah, I'm calling a professional for this." Same thing with Central Media's Facebook Ads tutorial 2025 video. They literally give away their exact process, but then after watching it, a lot of viewers will think, you know what, this looks complicated. I'd rather just hire someone who already knows what they're doing. And boom, new clients. Okay. The third awareness video type that works are reactions. This is pretty simple really. You just find advice or tips in your field that other YouTubers or Tik Tockers have made and then you share your take on those. The money guys have blown up doing this kind of thing. They react to really terrible financial advice from Tik Tok and people seem to love it. Myself included. I watch it a lot. So, what makes reaction videos so powerful? Well, they instantly position you as the expert without you ever having to say, you know, I'm an expert. You're just naturally showing what you know by pointing out what works and what doesn't. So, you're basically kind of positioning yourself as the judge of other people's content, which just gives you this immediate authority boost. Plus, there's one of the easiest videos I make since you're basically just commenting on stuff that's already out there. Now, let's jump to the middle part of the funnel, the consideration stage. So, your prospects already know they have a problem and they're actively checking out different solutions for it. So, they might be thinking about hiring someone like you, but they're still shopping around. Video podcasts are absolute gold here. These are basically conversations that let you share your ideas with a wider audience. Jay Hale Fitness does this perfectly. They interview clients about their fitness journeys on their podcast. So when viewers see and hear these real stories, they not only see how good the trainers are, but they also get inspired by the actual results. And because it's a natural conversation, your personality gets to shine through without trying too hard, hitting that third part of our triangle that we talked about earlier. Think about it. You probably feel like you know your favorite podcast host personally even though you've never met them. That's the exact same kind of connection that you can build with your future clients here. Compilation videos are a really smart consideration stage winner. So these repackage multiple videos up into one longer video, creating longer watch sessions that help people just go deeper with your content. It's basically a self-contained binge session of all of your best insights. I've done about five of these now on various different topics I talk about and almost every time they get more views than the individual videos got. Every time I do it, I always feel a little weird about it, but then I'm honestly shocked at how well they perform. It's like getting a second life out of the content that I already made. And when someone watches a 30 to 60 minute compilation, they're investing serious time with you, which makes them much more likely to consider hiring you. Third up, we have whiteboard sessions. So, these are those deep dive videos where you break down really complex topics step by step. You can use an actual whiteboard like Alec Cormosi does, or you can just go digital with it. I actually tried this recently with my iPad and I get lots of comments on those videos. People seem to like them. Charlie Morgan did this perfectly with his dopamine loading video. That thing has over 250,000 views and has brought him tons of clients, too. So, what works so well about these videos is they let you walk people through your unique way of thinking, right? You're literally showing how your brain works as you solve problems, which is super powerful for building that trust factor. Plus, adding a visual element keeps people engaged way longer than just talking to the camera for 15 minutes would. Finally, let's look at the bottom of the funnel, the decision stage. So, these viewers, they're ready to hire someone and now they're just trying to decide if you're the right person to hire. Now, this is where you really want to bring your agame because these people are so close to becoming clients. Case studies are incredibly powerful here. So, they basically just document processes and outcomes without ever being promotional. SEO expert Matt Diggity has a video showing how his team grew a client's traffic by 3,2%. He includes real metrics, clear tactics, and he explains why those strategies worked. You know, showing this kind of concrete proof that your methods work in real situations is usually the final push that someone needs to be able to reach out. It's kind of the equivalent of the before and after photos of your work because when they're that close to making a decision, sometimes they just need to see it to believe it. Hybrid interviews are another decision stage winner. So these aren't just podcast style start to finish interviews where the guest gets all the credit. So you get to edit it together in a way where you can add your own insights and collaborate on problem solving that highlights your expert opinions too. So I did one with Andy Crustadina about about us pages where we both brought our points of view to the table. It's more work to put together than a regular interview because of the editing involved, but it positions you as a peer with other experts, which is pretty awesome for building credibility. Think of it like a jam session between two musicians rather than just interviewing a rock star. You're both creating something valuable together. Next up, we have live streams where you're connecting with your audience in real time. Career coach Holly Lee does these live ré review videos where she critiques résumés on the spot. Your biggest fans are going to love getting that kind of personal attention from you and honestly there's nothing for them like when they hear you say their name. It makes them feel really good and it just builds a lot of trust in the moment. So I remember the first time I did a live and I was like really nervous about it but you get over it pretty fast. Like once you're in in the moment it gets a lot easier and the energy is just different when you're connecting with people in real time like that. So, when people see you solving problems on the fly with no editing or a perfect script, they really start to picture what it'd be like to actually work with you. I should definitely start doing those again. You ever notice how someone can sound super smart and you still don't trust them? Like, who would you rather take advice from? A buttoned up financial planner trying to sell you something or your friend who also happens to be a finance expert? The answer seems pretty obvious. Yet, when most business owners get in front of a camera on YouTube, they can't help but to transform into stiff corporate presenters. This disconnect is costing you clients because YouTube viewers are known to be 71% more likely to follow advice from creators that they feel personally connected to. Now, to really understand the shift, I want you to think about that one co-orker or client you've had who's pretty much all business. Per my previous email and circle back are their favorite phrases. Their personality just seems vacuum sealed right out of them. But then you end up at the same afterwork happy hour and suddenly Susan from accounting is a completely different person. She drops the work act. You know, she tells hilarious stories about her weekend hiking disaster and becomes someone that you actually want to hang out with. And when we meet the real Susan, we listen more closely. We trust her advice more because we see her as a real person who actually wants to help, not just someone who's doing their job, right? The same thing happens on YouTube. You know, viewers connect with real people, not these polished corporate personas. Check out this financial expert. >> During times of market stress or when others are constrained, >> whether this is his true personality, I don't know. Maybe he's naturally serious and he talks at a high level. Or maybe he's trying to sound professional because he thinks he has to to be taken seriously. Now, contrast that with how the Money Guys channel talks about the exact same topics. Don't know how to get your finances turned around? We want to help you. It's casual. They're having fun and they don't make you feel dumb for not knowing everything already. It's like you're just having a beer with them getting really solid advice. And this matters because people watch YouTube in casual settings, in bed, during lunch breaks, not in conference rooms, you know. So when you come at them with this formal corporate speak, it just feels out of place and it creates unnecessary distance. So why does speaking like a friend work so much better? It's because of something called the parasocial relationship, which is just a fancy way of saying that viewers start to feel like they know you even when they haven't met you before. And when that happens, they're way more likely to become clients because people hire people that they trust, not businesses, right? Look at how Ali Abdal talks like he's chatting with a friend over coffee, even about otherwise complex topics. >> But at age 25, he was completely broke. But he managed to get mentored by this business tycoon guy called Mr. Chauffe. >> He never sounds scripted and that makes people trust him more. And there's even research that shows how minor imperfections can make you more likable. It's called the Prattfall effect. And research shows that customers love it. Those occasional ums and a's and, you know, natural speech patterns actually build more trust. They don't really damage your credibility the way some people think. So, how do you actually channel your inner happy hour, Susan? If the boardroom is more your comfort zone, I've got some specific techniques that actually work. So, first, try what I call the small group effect. A lot of YouTube advice tells you to imagine when you're talking to the camera to imagine you're talking to just one person rather than your whole YouTube audience. And that's good advice. That can help to a degree, but I have found that can actually make you a little too quiet and low energy on camera. The camera naturally kind of sucks away about half your energy and your personality. So, if you're talking like you're just having a really quiet one-on-one conversation to begin with, it can really come across as flat or boring to your viewers. Instead, I like to imagine I'm talking to a small group of people, like three or four. Think about how you naturally act when you're talking to a group of friends. You're a little more animated. You use more hand gestures. Your voice has more ups and downs. And you probably smile more. So that extra energy is perfect for what the camera ends up taking away. Next, use everyday language instead of business talk. Gabe Bolt is great at this. He talks about financial stuff, but he uses normal words that make it all really easy to understand. >> You don't need a lot. You don't need more stuff to be happier. >> He doesn't try to come across like a financial adviser. He sounds like that friend who knows about money who's just giving you some good advice over lunch. And here's how to make your own videos sound more conversational. Don't worry for even one second about grammar. This isn't school and nobody's grading you. That means use contractions. You know, don't instead of do not. It just sounds way more natural when you're talking. And feel free to start sentences with and or but if that's how you normally talk. Replace those fancy terms with everyday words whenever you can. and include phrases like, you know, actually, or basically that we all tend to use in normal conversation. And always read your script out loud as if you're just talking naturally. If it feels weird to you or sounds weird, change it before you sit down to record. The third key is warmth in your voice and body language. So, even small tensions in your face or your voice can make viewers feel uncomfortable. Now, if it helps, start with your smile. You know, it changes everything about how you sound. Even a slight real smile warms up your voice automatically. I'm not saying you need a crazy huge smile, you know, just enough to lift your energy up. Amy Porterfield is amazing at this. >> You kind of got to figure out what you're good at, what you love, where your spot is. >> Her tone's warm and friendly, and that immediately makes you feel close to her. And the ironic thing is, and she knows this because she talks about it a lot, she doesn't actually share all that much about her personal life, but even with, you know, her boundaries up, her voice and her tone still make you feel like she's your best friend coming at you through your earbuds. Now, before I film, if I can, if someone's home, I always try to talk with someone first, just to warm up my natural voice. And I also picture the camera as someone who I genuinely want to help, which naturally makes me more enthusiastic about it. Personal stories are another powerful way to connect. They show that you've been through the same stuff as your viewers, and they just prove that you're human, not just some talking head. And you don't need to share your whole life story. Just sprinkle in some relevant stories that you know show how you overcame the same problems that your viewers have or reveal mistakes that you've made and what you learned from them. Share client success stories without names if you can't share those. And then give behindthe-scenes looks at your process. And finally, don't worry about sounding perfect. Small mistakes actually make people trust you. So, it's fine to keep those occasional word fumbles or having to rephrase something. the natural ums and a's. Don't go crazy editing those out, laughing at yourself if you misspeak or getting excited about your topic. Just edit out any major technical issues or anything that's, you know, over-the-top distracting. And my most unexpected tip for coming across naturally is coming up in a minute. But if you're thinking, Wes, I can't just wing it on camera. Don't worry. I actually use a teleprompter for almost every video, and it doesn't stop me from sounding natural. It just takes a little practice. Using a teleprompter gives me confidence in knowing exactly what to say. It helps me cover all my points without going off on tangents, and it lets me focus on how I'm delivering the content instead of trying to remember everything. The secret to a natural sounding teleprompter delivery is all in how you write your script. So, I write it exactly how I would naturally say it, not how I'd write an email or blog post. I write in the phrases that I would naturally use if I'm talking to someone. And I like to capitalize the words that I know that I want to emphasize so I don't have to think too hard about that in the moment. Now, if you're trying to use YouTube to get clients, you're probably more of an education channel. But I actually want you to look for inspiration in a kind of unexpected place, entertainment channels. Sure, it's a completely different kind of video, but these guys are really good at making viewers feel included and engaged. Entertainment creators are really good at naturally talking to their audience as friends, not as students or leads, right? They use humor, personal stories, and casual language that builds trust. They're not afraid to go off script or show their real reactions. And you can still keep all of your expertise while just borrowing their approachable style. Being smart and friendly is a really powerful combination. I want you to notice how entertainment creators start their videos with energy and personality, react genuinely to their own content, use simple language even for complicated ideas, and they share their real opinions instead of just facts. This doesn't mean you need to suddenly become a comedian or completely change who you are. I think it's just more about giving yourself permission to drop the workday act and let happy hour finally start. David Jackson's brand new YouTube channel has already brought in over a hundred grand in recurring revenue in the past 30 days alone. But how does a 4month-old channel with just over a 100red subscribers and an average of 200 views per video bring in that kind of money? I sat down with David to see exactly how he's doing it. David's been running his SEO agency, Techie, in Overland Park, Kansas, for about 10 years. And it wasn't always easy. So, David, what did getting clients look like for you before you got started on YouTube? >> I got them the same as everyone else. You know, just going to networking events, relying on referrals, trying to reach out to old contacts. That's really how a lot of agencies are. Word of mouth is just not reliable. You could get three, four, five referrals in a single month and feel like, wow, this is going to continue and last forever. And then suddenly the next two or 3 months you get maybe one or two. So, you can't scale or grow that way. You can't bank on that. >> So, it sounds like you were kind of limited to your own local area and I can't imagine Overland Park is a huge market, right? >> We're not limited to just people here. However, that's all that we were really able to get because we had such a localized strategy and just going to networking events or going to people we knew. It limited us to just that. And it was also pretty difficult to spend the time doing that every week. But it gets even worse because not only was David not getting the volume of business that he knew he and his team could handle, but the ones he did get into consultations were only focused on one thing. >> They want the price on that call. We would pitch that, oh, I've got to do that just to find out what you guys can do or oh, that seems steep or or send me more information about that later. So, the close rate was very very low because just give me the price. I just need to know so I can pull the trigger on this. And honestly, that's way too common a story. I bet you know exactly what David is talking about there. You know, he knew if he wanted to hit his goals, something had to change. So, what was your inspiration for turning to YouTube? >> Well, can I say you? Because I have been watching you since the deep end days. I would also just hear about the results of being on YouTube and I I'd been talking about it for so long. I mean, I had been talking about doing this for over a year, and I just never pulled the trigger. >> So, he'd been thinking of doing YouTube for a long time, but >> I was afraid that I didn't know what to talk about. Like, I I thought, "Okay, what am I going to go and tell people how to build a website? You know, I'm going to sound like a lot of other people." >> But then David remembered something from his days working at a big computer store that finally made it click in his head. The majority of the clientele didn't really understand anything about technology. There was a time where a gentleman walked in and he said, "I need to take files from one computer and move them to another." And in my head, I'm thinking, "We'll just buy a USB drive." And he says, "Well, what's that?" So, I said, "Well, it's like a water bucket. You take water from one well, move it to the other, and dump it in." He got it immediately. And he said, "Wow, I'll take 18 of those." That's exactly what I'm doing with digital marketing. It's a very seemingly complicated thing that I want to break down and be very straightforward and practical about and apply it to business. Learning all of that helped give me the confidence to say that this packaging here works for YouTube and it works for video. >> So, it was David's aha moment about how he'd approach his topics along with some inspiration from YouTuber Miles Beckler that finally made him press record for that first time. Every morning, all he did was turn his webcam on and talk for 10 minutes about a marketing or affiliate topic. But after 180 days, I think he was generating like 200,000 hits or something to his website. His videos weren't over the top. They weren't crazy editing. They were just him talking on camera. It was more about the value of what he said and the value he was delivering. I just thought, if I just turn this camera on, start talking about this, go through it step by step, what's the worst that can happen? I put myself in a corner while I was on my screen just pointing and clicking and showing everything. So yeah, it was just me down in the bottom right uh just in my living room going through everything that we do for a client when we optimize their Google business profile and it was a 30inute video. >> But little did David know at the time that that 30inut video would kickstart a whole new chapter in his business. So you got a total of nine videos uploaded as of right now. When did you first start getting people contacting you because they found you on YouTube? >> It it was about a month ago. It took about 4 months and then this last month it it's really really been consistent. We're getting anywhere from two to four inquiries per week. We're not paying for any ads. We're not investing in any any sort of paid leads or anything like that. This is all happening organically. And it all started to pick up after this YouTube channel took off. And in this past month, how many clients have you gotten from YouTube? Uh, >> it would be five. >> That's amazing that it's taken off that fast for you. So, if you're comfortable sharing, what's the average value of one of these new clients? >> It's anywhere from $18,000 to about $30,000 per year because they pay us monthly. You know, we're talking over $100,000 from YouTube. And just to be clear, that's a h 100red grand of annually recurring revenue every year that accumulated in his first month of YouTube inquiries alone. If you wanted to extrapolate that out across 12 months, we're talking 1.2 million. But it gets even better because most of his clients stick with him for multiple years, meaning this year's 1.2 million will stack on top of next year's 1.2 million and so on. And let's not forget he's getting that much with a tiny brand new channel. It stands to reason that the more he keeps up with it, those numbers are going to grow and snowball every year. >> And I can imagine that your consult calls feel a little different now than the old days when it was, you know, just all about, you know, give me a price. So, how are those going now? >> When people are coming through YouTube, they're not asking about the price. They're asking for recommendations. They're asking for an opinion. They're asking about direction. I'm interested in learning more and I'm willing to pay for that because I've seen the value through your videos. And we're getting so many more of that type of that type of customer. That's how all of those five have been. You know, they all paid for that initial analysis and then they pulled the trigger after we showed them the road map. They said, "This makes perfect sense. Let's do it." >> And what about your videos do you think is making that difference? >> It's the best way to connect with someone because you're getting across your your demeanor. you're getting across your tone and a client just really brings down all of their walls, all of those defenses because they see you right there. And I think one of the strongest things that's helped us sell, especially people that come through finding us on YouTube, is what they're seeing in the video gets matched when they actually talk to me because people do have anxiety about purchasing something or engaging in a big sale, especially in B2B. But when you reduce that anxiety, help create that expectation, and then match the expectation when they talk to you that you set through the video, that's a client for life, and they're going to refer you. A little later, David's going to reveal his blackjack strategy I told you about before that doubled his leads overnight. But even knowing that you can get results like this, you might still be hesitant to try it because you've got, you know, a business to run. The thing is, though, making YouTube videos doesn't have to be as hard as you think. David's actually figured out a really easy way that works for him. >> When I start, I open up all of my tabs in advance. So, we're going to be looking at this tool. We're going to be looking at this tool, this tool, and then I open up Loom, put myself in the corner, and I just start recording. It's pretty loose. I don't really have much of a script. I do take bullet point notes for an outline sometimes, but for the most part, it's just me talking about uh what I know and what we do at our agency. And I'm being very very candid and very straightforward about it. I I have gotten into writing the intro though. I I think that that's important to kind of hook someone and keep them watching. But after that, it's all just straightforward education. This is exactly how you do this. This is exactly what it means. After that video is recorded, I go through I edit it with Cap Cut. I just cut it down. And I don't like a lot of long pauses and I don't like a lot of ums and a's because I I think it just helps with the retention of the video. But that's really it. After I export it, I upload it to YouTube. >> How long does it take you to do a whole video now start to finish? >> I would say my time to shoot and put a video out though has been reduced uh quite a bit. If I shoot it Wednesday night, I can have it up by Thursday. >> And you're just making them to be found in search, right? >> Yes, they are search based. I do try to be careful in how it's titled and what the description says, you know, YouTube SEO as they call it. >> So, now I want to talk about the big breakthrough that you had once you started getting, you know, a little bit of traction on one of your videos. So, what did you notice and how did you capitalize on it to get even better results? We produced a video on Google LSA and I was paying attention to all of my past videos and about how many views they were getting in a day and on average it was, you know, maybe 10 to 20 views in a day, but the LSA video had gotten about 50 in a day and I thought, wow, this one is moving quite a bit. A few days later, it was over a hundred and I thought, okay, this this is a topic that people care about. It also had the most engagement as far as likes and comments. So, I thought, well, I'm going to do another LSA video because I have more to say on this particular topic. I released the second LSA video, and it followed the trend. It got quite a bit more views and engagement than some of my other videos. So, LSA seemed to be something that people were interested in, and I just capitalized on the engagement because I just paid attention. >> It's like in blackjack, when you've got a good hand, you double down on it. In this case, that just means when you make a video that outperforms your others, make another on that topic. And as long as each one you do performs well, you can keep going back to that topic over and over again. Your audience is obviously into it, and it lets you really easily create binge sessions that way. If you're using YouTube to grow your business, you might feel like you're doing everything right. Consistent uploads, valuable content, helpful advice. But here's what no one tells you. Most of that content is actively repelling the people who would have paid you. So after analyzing over a thousand channels this past year, including ones that my own viewers submitted, I found five repeating mistakes that completely destroy client generation. Okay, so let's start with Don McGee's real estate channel here. So right up top here, her channel banner has her headshot, which is good. She's got her uh broker logo and contact information. Then her profile description here focuses entirely on her credentials and her services. And if we look at her videos, what are we mostly seeing here? Right, they're mostly property listings. There's an address here. It's one one particular house. It's another family home for sale right here. Then we've got another one. And there's almost no educational content here. So all this together adds up to one big mistake. She's basically using YouTube to sell her services, not to attract clients with what they've come for, which is free, useful information about moving to Nova Scotia. You know, people come to YouTube to learn and to solve problems, not to be sold to. So, when someone's searching for information about Nova Scotia real estate, they're usually months away from actually hiring an agent. They're trying to figure out if moving there makes sense for them in the first place, right? They want to know which neighborhood is going to be best for them, what the schools are like, that kind of stuff. A much better approach here would be creating content that actually helps people in that research phase, right? Videos like five most affordable Nova Scotia neighborhoods for families or what $500,000 buys you in different parts of Halifax or Nova Scotia versus New Brunswick, where should you move. These kinds of topics serve people who are earlier in their journey but are exactly who are going to need a real estate agent in the very near future. Then there's, you know, still the matter of her her banner and her about section. I always tell people not to make these elements all about what you actually charge money for. So what I'd rather see her do is something like Darren Chris here. He emphasizes that on his channel, you're going to learn about living in LA, which is very different than, you know, hire me as your realtor, even though you're trying to figure stuff out right now on YouTube. Just make this and this first and foremost about, you know, that this is the kind of stuff you're going to learn for free on my channel. And don't worry, the sale will still happen naturally after you give them what they actually came for. They'll follow the links to your website and reach out when they're ready without you ever having to make the hard sell. Okay. Now, the second major mistake is one that I'm very familiar with because I did the same thing myself back in the day. So, this is Oisa's channel. He's a web designer, and YouTube's actually a great way to get web design clients if you play it right. But if you look through his videos, he's making videos about like how I closed a web design client, how to build a successful web design portfolio, you know, how to build multiple income streams as a designer. These are topics that are perfect for other web designers, but completely missing the mark for potential clients who actually need a website. Now, this could be okay if he has some way of monetizing this new audience of other designers. But as I go through his links, right, he's got a a website right here. This looks very much to me like it's a website for, you know, clients to check out his work. So, he doesn't seem to offer anything to those web designers that he seems to be trying to attract on YouTube. So really, this is more of a hobby channel at this point. And believe me, I know how easy it is to fall into this trap because I made the same mistake years ago. I had a pretty popular podcast called the Deeply Graphic Design Cast with we had thousands of listeners. It wasn't too bad, but they were all fellow designers, right? Not a single client ever came from that podcast. I was talking to my peers, not to my potential customers. And I get it. We naturally we like to talk about what we're passionate about and sometimes we don't know exactly how to talk about those topics in a way that our clients would care about them. So what can Alisa here do? Well, it's easy. Just flip your audience focus. So if you're a web designer, you want to make videos like five website mistakes costing small businesses clients or how to know if your website needs a redesign or what every service business homepage needs to convert visitors. These topics directly address the problems that your potential clients are probably having. And when you make videos that are meant to bring in actual clients, not just talk to peers who love what you love, you can actually turn your YouTube channel from a hobby into a real marketing strategy. Okay, next up, let's take a look at this cleaning business channel from clean snob. At first glance, it looks pretty good, right? I mean, it's fun. It's cheerful. But when you look closer at some of her thumbnails, there are definitely a few issues. Now, I picked this channel in particular to roast for this just because she's actually making a few of the most common thumbnail mistakes that I always see. So, it's kind of a one-stop shop for that. Now, before we dive into the actual issues, let's talk for a quick second about why thumbnails are important in the first place and what you should be doing with them to get the best results. First, they're the biggest job they have is to be eye-catching enough to make people take immediate notice when they see them on, you know, the YouTube homepage. And I do think actually a lot of these fit the bill nicely. They're bright and she looks like you'd have fun watching her. But then after grabbing that attention, the thumbnail needs to give a quick little visual of what the video is going to be about and what you're going to get out of watching it. And a lot of these are just too cluttered or have the wrong focus to really convey that. So let's take a look at this one for instance. So we have her face, two pink boxes of the text, we have this other text, we have this arrow. That's just a lot going on. And the, you know, spelling errors here. This just doesn't really say anything, right? I get that it's about decluttering, but I have no idea what this, you know, no one knows text even means. And this is a huge missed opportunity because as a small channel, you might get one chance to get in front of a new viewer. And if you waste that chance to tell them why this video is the one they need to watch right now, you're probably going to lose them forever. But so many YouTubers just kind of resort to repeating the title in the thumbnail when you should be using it to either focus on a different angle that they might like more or visually show the thing that they would be most interested in based on the title. So rather than this confusing thumbnail, what if it showed the result of the decluttering instead? Something more like this. Or rather than just repeating the title, you know, bathroom speed clean in the thumbnail, what if it focused on the part after she's finished, which is, let's face it, that's what people really want, right? See the difference here? These new thumbnails show something that makes the core idea all the more enticing to click on. They're easy to understand at a glance, and they carry the story forward. All right, let's pull up this next channel submitted by John. It's called Grow a Healthy Church. Take a look at some of these video titles. Young men are returning to church. the surprising vibe shift explained with Ste and then it cuts off or why small groups fail. Now, I get it. These are probably topics that Jon genuinely cares about and thinks are valuable enough to share. But the big problem is I can guarantee you nobody is typing these phrases into YouTube search bar. And if they are, these titles just aren't specific enough to show up in the search results. And this is a huge mistake that so many smaller channels make. copying the way that bigger channels make their titles while completely ignoring search intent. So, just for a bit of context here, there are generally two ways for people to find your videos on YouTube. The first is when people actually search for something, then YouTube matches that search term with the videos that it thinks that you want to watch. Think of it like video SEO, basically. Now, the other way is that YouTube just knows who you are based on what you watch and what you like, and it puts stuff on your homepage that it thinks you're going to like, and you don't have to search for it. This is where we tend to see the more curiosity based titles and that viral potential pop up. But the thing is, when your videos are still getting under 100red views, YouTube doesn't know exactly who to recommend your videos to yet. That means your main source of growth is going to be search traffic. So, you have to figure out exactly what your potential audience is typing in and then match your videos to that. And I actually pulled up some search data for this niche. And guess what? People aren't looking for broad philosophical discussions on church leadership. They're looking for more practical real life stuff like how to increase church attendance, church volunteer recruitment ideas, and youth engagement ideas for small churches. And the good news is you don't even have to ditch the topics that you care about. You just want to tweak how you're packaging them. So instead of young men are returning to church, try something like how I grew my church by 30% in six months. Instead of why small groups fail, try three communitybuilding activities to bring new families to your church. It's all about finding that overlap, right? The sweet spot between what you know you can make a great video about and sharing what your audience is actively searching for. Then after you start getting more and more views, you can start to really layer in those more curiositybased titles into your mix. All right, let's move on to our next channel. This is from Justin Mott, and he's a photography coach. You know, he helps other photographers uh with their careers and learning photography. But I I took a look at some of his videos and right away I could kind of pinpoint a mistake that's probably costing him about 30 to 40% of his potential clients in the first 30 seconds of every video. So, let's take a look at how this video starts. You've got a B-roll sequence. Here's Justin walking into his office, picking up his camera, putting it in his pocket, and then just showing the camera off. And all this happens with just some background music playing, no voice over at all. Then only after about 15 seconds do we get any kind of an intro. >> What is the perfect compact camera? Well, for me, for this guy, for this photographer, this is. >> Now, don't get me wrong, he poses a great question to start things off here, but by this point, he's already lost a huge chunk of his audience. And losing viewers isn't just losing views, it's losing potential clients and money. So, let me quickly show you something really important about how YouTube viewers actually behave. So, I want you to take a look at this retention graph from one of my own videos. So, see this sharp drop off right in the first 30 seconds. This happens in nearly every single video on YouTube, especially the educational ones. It's that moment when your viewers are deciding if your content is actually worth their time. And on average, uh, about 30 to 40% of the viewers are going to click away in these first few seconds if you don't immediately give them something valuable or make it really clear exactly what they're going to learn here. And here's why this is even worse. YouTube's algorithm really rewards videos that keep people watching early on. So, if viewers leave right away, your videos get buried, which is especially rough for smaller channels trying to grow. So, get to the point really fast. There's nothing wrong with Justin leading his videos with some B-roll footage, but he should be adding his voice over immediately. And instead of opening with, "Hey everyone, welcome back." Try diving right into what people are going to get from your video. Even ask an interesting question that you promise to answer in the video. You can still introduce yourself and give your credentials, build your authority, all that good stuff, but only after you've actually hooked viewers by providing that immediate value. And trust me, you definitely want to ditch those fancy animated intros and asking people to subscribe upfront. Those things just tell the viewers that you're more focused on yourself than on solving their problems. Can I tell you a secret? While everyone is obsessing over short form video, you know, Tik Tok, shorts, reals, the smartest businesses are quietly doing something completely different and bringing in more clients with less effort. Meanwhile, short form videos just become the junk food of marketing. Feels good in the moment, gives you that quick dopamine hit of views and likes, but it leaves you hungry for actual business results. After helping hundreds of service businesses build real client generating systems, I can tell you with absolute certainty, the path to clients isn't paved with 60-second clips. It's something else entirely. But to understand how we got trapped in the short form content cycle, we need to look back about 5 years. So when COVID hit and we all got stuck at home, something crazy happened with how we consume content. Everyone was just at home scrolling on their phones all day and suddenly Tik Tok exploded. It was the gold rush of short videos. Everyone, creators, businesses, my upstairs neighbor, unfortunately, they all jumped on these platforms trying to go viral. And honestly, those early results were addictive. You know, regular people were gaining followers and growing in a way that they never could have on Instagram. Brands were seeing millions of views without a lot of effort. It really felt like we'd finally found it. Quick and easy content that people actually wanted to watch. Then came the next wave of every other social platform racing to copy what Tik Tok had made so popular. Suddenly, every marketing guru started saying the same thing. Get on Tik Tok. Make reals. Post shorts. This is where all the attention is. And yeah, they weren't wrong about the attention part. But now that we're a few years out from that initial blast, we're finally seeing short videos for what they are. All those views aren't turning into actual business results for most service providers. I'm talking to business coaches, web designers, you name it, with hundreds of thousands of views who still can't fill their calendars. So obviously, there is a huge disconnect between getting seen and getting hired. And if you want your marketing to actually work in 2025, you need to understand why this gap exists in the first place. Now, I'm not going to sit here and tell you that short form video is completely useless. It's not. There are some genuinely good things about it. It's amazing for grabbing quick attention. It works across literally every social platform. And let's be real, you know, shorts are pretty easy to make. You can film them on your phone from anywhere. But here's where the problems start. If you talk to anybody who knows anything about marketing on these platforms, they'll tell you that you need to post at least once every single day to get any real traction. And most of the real experts, they're saying three to four times a day is the sweet spot. Let that sink in for a second. Four shorts every single day >> forever. >> That's 28 shorts a day, 120 a month. That's insane. And you know what? Even if you somehow manage to keep up that pace, there's absolutely no guarantee it's going to bring you a single client. The average brand out there posts about 10 social posts per day across all their networks. Now, that might be fine for big companies with dedicated social media teams, but for you, a service provider who's also trying to, you know, actually serve clients, it's a recipe for burnout. But even if you push through, you still end up in the short form video hamster wheel, cranking out content day after day, getting those views and likes, and it's keeping you busy so you feel like you're actually accomplishing something. But there's a big difference between accomplishment and activity. So why isn't all this attention turning into actual business? Well, there are a couple reasons. First, there's this concept in marketing called the 7-Eleven rule. So that basically says that people need about 7 hours of exposure to you spread across about 11 different sessions before they feel like they know you enough to want to take the relationship any further. Think about that. 7 hours across 11 sessions. Now think about a 30- secondond Tik Tok. How many of those would someone need to watch to reach that 7 hour mark? About 840 of your videos. 840. What are the odds that someone's going to see 840 of your short videos? Basically zero, right? The algorithms just don't work that way. They're designed to show people a variety of content, not over 800 videos from the same creator. And even if they did see a bunch of your shorts, it's still happening in these tiny little snippets. You know, that's not how real relationships form. It's not how trust is built. There's also the mindset problem. You know, when people are scrolling through Tik Tok or reals, they're in entertain me mode, right? They're not in I need to solve my problem mode. They're looking for that quick dopamine hit, and that's pretty much all. Okay, let me give you a perfect example of why attention on its own doesn't always equal sales. So, there was this creator named Ari who had 2.6 million followers, which sounds pretty good, right? problem is she launched a clothing line and she couldn't even sell the 36 t-shirt minimum to keep her manufacturing going. Not 36,000, 36 shirts with 2.6 million followers. Couldn't do it. And that's because her followers weren't actually invested in her. They might have enjoyed her videos for a couple seconds when they scrolled past it, but they didn't have enough of a real connection to want to buy from her. And at the end of the day, isn't that what marketing is supposed to do? Shorts create this impossible situation where you're working harder than ever on your marketing while seeing fewer actual business results. Think about what your life actually looks like when you commit to that strategy. Your days become consumed with constantly scanning for trends to stay relevant, brainstorming on how to turn all your knowledge into 30-se secondond clips, checking your stats obsessively to see what's working and what isn't. and feeling the pressure to post again before your last video stops getting views. It's exhausting because there's no finish line in sight. You know, the moment you slow down or you take a break, your visibility just goes down a cliff. You become a content creating machine instead of a service provider. I have watched so many talented professionals burn out this way. You know, a wedding photographer student of mine spent 2 to three hours every single day making these reels for 6 months straight. Her views were solid, her follower count grew, but her actual bookings ended up dropping because she was spending less time on customer outreach and portfolio development. You know, the things that actually got her paying customers before the algorithms created this perfect trap where you feel like you're just one viral video away from success. So, you keep pushing, you keep creating. But the reality is for service businesses, this approach is just fundamentally flawed. So, if short form video is such a trap, what's the alternative? What are those smart service businesses doing instead? The answer might surprise you because it's actually much simpler and requires way less content creation. Long- form video. But Wes, doesn't long form video take more time, not less. Here's the truth. Making one simple 10-minute talking head video every week takes way less time and energy than planning and creating 20 different shorts. And more importantly, it's just way more effective at actually bringing in paying customers. See, when someone spends 10 minutes at a time with you, something magical happens. They start to feel like they actually know you a little bit. They get a sense of your personality, your approach, and your expertise. Now, compare that to someone who watched three of your 30 secondond clips. Which person do you think is more likely to become a paying customer? It's not even close. But the advantages go way beyond just the length here. The real power of long- form content comes from how people find and consume it. Short form is all about the scroll. You know, people mindlessly swiping until something catches their attention for a couple seconds. But long form, especially on YouTube, is about search. People actively looking for solutions to specific problems. So, which person would you rather have watching your videos? And let me let you in on a little secret about YouTube that most service providers don't get. It's not actually about going viral. It's not about massive view counts or getting tons of subs. It is just about connecting with the right people. And YouTube's actually had a pretty big algorithm change this year to help you do that. I don't know if you checked your YouTube homepage lately, but they've started showing videos from smaller creators right alongside the big names. And they're doing this because they've gotten really good at figuring out exactly what kind of content each person wants to watch. And this is huge for service businesses. It means that YouTube will try to show your videos to the exact people who are interested in what you do, even if you're just starting out. But here's another reason why this approach is actually easier. You don't need to be constantly shifting your strategy. You know, with short form, you're always chasing the latest sound, the latest transition, the latest trend, and short form algorithms are pretty timebased, meaning they prioritize new content. So, they may show your video you made today for the next week, if you're lucky, then it fizzles out. With long form, though, you can focus on creating genuinely helpful content that stays relevant for years. that lets you stack up videos that show people you really know your stuff, building your reputation over time instead of vanishing after a week. In fact, some of my most successful videos were recorded over 3 years ago, and they're still bringing in new students to my paid courses every month. Every video I make is basically another soldier in my sales army fighting that good fight day after day for years. Now, does all this mean you should completely abandon shorts? Not necessarily. There's actually a pretty smart way to incorporate them into your strategy without falling into the trap. Here's how I recommend actually using shorts. First, they're amazing for on camera practice when you're new. So, if you're at all nervous about being on video, and let's be honest, most of us are when we start, creating quick 30 to 60-second videos is a really nice low pressure way to get comfortable talking to the camera. I actually have my students in my YouTube to clients academy course record five shorts every day for a week just to get more comfortable talking to a camera. It's not about the videos themselves. It's about building their confidence. Second, once you've created your main long- form content, you can repurpose it into shorts. So, you can use AI tools like Opus Clip to analyze all your videos and it's going to pull the short clips out of it that should make sense and stand on their own. This gives you content for both formats without doubling your workload. The key difference here is in the purpose. So, you're not using shorts as your primary strategy to get paying customers. You're using them as supplementary content to drive people to your longer videos where that real relationship building happens. But of course, you can't just make any long videos and hope that they work, you know. But the good news is there is hard data put out by YouTube themselves that shows exactly what your ideal clients want out of your videos. And I've put together all those gold nuggets into this video right here. Because if you know what'll keep them interested in watching, that means they'll watch another and another creating that binge session that leads directly from YouTube back to your business where they can become a paying client. So, click right here and I'm going to lay it all
