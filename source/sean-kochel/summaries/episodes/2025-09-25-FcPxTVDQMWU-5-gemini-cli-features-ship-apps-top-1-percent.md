# 5 Gemini CLI Features Ship Apps Top 1 Percent

In this episode, the host explores the essential features of terminal-based coding tools that significantly boost coding efficiency for developers, particularly those involved in "vibe coding."

## Core Thesis
The episode argues that among numerous terminal coding features, only a select few genuinely enhance a developer's efficiency and error management capabilities. Checkpointing and chat saving are highlighted as critical processes, enabling developers to maintain and revisit previous states of projects and conversations seamlessly.

## Key Insights
- **Checkpointing** allows developers to create and revert to different code states, aiding in error management and code recovery.
- The **chat saving feature** transforms informal experiments into structured development processes by documenting coding dialogues.
- Establishing the Gemini.markdown file as a "living document" ensures updated project conventions and clarity.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Implement checkpointing to manage and restore code states effectively.
2. Use chat saving to document and reference past coding conversations.
3. Regularly update the Gemini.markdown file to maintain coherent project documentation.

## Notable Quotes
> "There's a lot of talk on the street about the 90 different obscure features... but in reality, there's only really four or five that will really move the needle."

> "This chat saving really helps us transform from random experimentation to a systematic way to actually save and remember why we built certain things the way we did."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
Implementing these features can streamline software development projects, increase productivity, and ensure consistent quality in coding practices, aligning with the agency's goal of delivering top-tier applications.
