# Problem Soundbites Workshop

**Tagline:** Experience × AI

Now we need the PROBLEM hook for each track. The problem is where value comes from.

## Track 1: Venture Studio Dev Engagement

### The Landscape They're In
- Everyone claims AI-powered development
- Vibe coding demos everywhere, real products nowhere
- Junior devs with Cursor look like seniors (until they don't)
- Agencies selling "AI development" with no foundation
- More noise than ever, harder to tell real from fake
- The things that mattered before (architecture, scale, security) still matter—but who's doing them?

### Their Fears
- "How do I know if this person/agency is actually good?"
- "What if I'm paying for someone to learn on my project?"
- "What if this works now but explodes at scale?"
- "Everyone has the same pitch—how do I choose?"
- "I can't evaluate technical decisions, and I know it"
- "What if AI-generated code has problems I can't see?"

### Their Frustrations
- Wasted money on agencies that didn't deliver
- Prototypes that couldn't become products
- Technical debt from day one
- No one taking ownership
- Constant context-switching between contractors
- Feeling like they're gambling

### Problem Soundbite Options

**The Noise Problem**
1. "Everyone's selling AI development now. How do you know who's real?"
2. "A junior with Cursor looks like a senior. Until production."
3. "The AI hype is deafening. Finding actual expertise is harder than ever."
4. "More developers than ever. Fewer you can trust."

**The Posers Problem**
5. "Agencies are selling AI-powered development. Most are learning on your dime."
6. "Your contractor's 'AI expertise' might be two weeks of YouTube tutorials."
7. "Everyone demos well. Few survive customers."
8. "The gap between demo and product has never been wider."

**The Risk Problem**
9. "Choosing wrong costs you 6 months and your runway."
10. "The wrong technical decision today haunts you for years."
11. "You can't afford to be someone's learning project."
12. "One bad architecture choice and you're rebuilding everything."

**The Evaluation Problem**
13. "You need technical expertise to evaluate technical expertise."
14. "How do you hire a CTO when you can't assess a CTO?"
15. "The less you know about code, the easier you are to fool."
16. "Non-technical founders can't tell good from great. Or good from garbage."

**The Speed Trap**
17. "AI makes building fast. It also makes building wrong fast."
18. "You can ship a prototype in a weekend. Shipping a product takes something else."
19. "Velocity without direction is just expensive chaos."
20. "Fast is easy. Fast and right is rare."

**The Foundation Problem**
21. "Everyone starts from scratch. Everyone makes the same mistakes."
22. "Your first 10 technical decisions will define your next 3 years."
23. "There's no foundation under most AI-generated code."
24. "Blog code and hallucinations don't scale."

**The Alone Problem**
25. "You're making bet-the-company technical decisions with no one to gut-check."
26. "Solo founders don't have the luxury of learning from mistakes."
27. "Who reviews your architecture when it's just you and ChatGPT?"
28. "Building alone means failing alone."

## Track 2: AI Transformation (Established Business)

### The Landscape They're In
- Watching competitors automate, digitize, modernize
- AI is everywhere in the news, unclear how it applies
- Tried to hire developers—can't find good ones, or they're too expensive
- Had bad experiences with agencies or offshore teams
- Every vendor promises AI transformation
- Paralyzed by options and jargon

### Their Fears
- "We're going to get left behind"
- "I don't understand this well enough to make good decisions"
- "What if we spend a fortune and get nothing?"
- "What if we become dependent on technology we don't understand?"
- "What if we hire the wrong people and waste a year?"
- "Everyone's selling AI—how do I know what's real?"

### Their Frustrations
- Manual processes that should be automated
- Competitors moving faster
- Can't find/afford technical talent
- Previous tech projects failed or disappointed
- Feeling behind and not knowing how to catch up
- Don't want to become a tech company, just want to run their business

### Problem Soundbite Options

**The Left Behind Problem**
1. "Your competitors are automating. You're still on spreadsheets."
2. "The world is digitizing with or without you."
3. "Every month you wait, catching up gets harder."
4. "The businesses that don't adapt are the businesses that disappear."

**The Talent Problem**
5. "Good developers are impossible to find. Great ones are impossible to afford."
6. "You've tried to hire. It didn't work."
7. "The talent war is over. Talent won. You lost."
8. "You need technical help but can't find technical people."

**The Trust Problem**
9. "Every agency promises AI transformation. Most deliver PowerPoints."
10. "You've been burned by technology projects before."
11. "Vendors sell complexity because complexity justifies fees."
12. "The last 'digital transformation' was a disaster. Why would this be different?"

**The Identity Problem**
13. "You built a great business. You didn't sign up to become a tech company."
14. "You want the software, not the software team."
15. "Running a business is hard enough without managing developers."
16. "You have a business to run. Technology is a means, not the mission."

**The Paralysis Problem**
17. "Everyone's selling AI solutions. You can't tell what's real."
18. "The more you research, the more confused you get."
19. "There are a hundred options and zero clarity."
20. "You know you need to do something. You don't know what."

**The Speed Problem**
21. "Everything is moving so fast that building anything feels risky."
22. "By the time you build it, will it be obsolete?"
23. "Technology changes every week. How do you commit to anything?"
24. "The landscape shifts faster than you can plan."

**The Risk/Cost Problem**
25. "Software projects always cost more and take longer than promised."
26. "You have budget. You don't have confidence it will be well-spent."
27. "The fear of wasting money keeps you from spending money."
28. "Every tech decision feels like a gamble you're not qualified to make."

## Full PEACE Draft: Track 1 (Venture Studio)

Using Problem 1C:

| | Soundbite |
|---|-----------|
| **P** | "You need technical expertise to evaluate technical expertise. In a world of AI demos and vibe-coded prototypes, how do you know what's real?" |
| **E** | "We've been the CTO three times. We've hired developers, fired agencies, and cleaned up messes. We know exactly how hard this is." |
| **A** | "We're a venture studio—not an agency. We rarely take outside projects. When we do, you build on a platform we've refined for 30 years." |
| **C** | "Experience × AI: decades of patterns, accelerated by modern tools." |
| **E** | "So you ship production software while others are still debugging their demos." |

---

## Full PEACE Draft: Track 2 (AI Transformation)

Using Problem 2B:

| | Soundbite |
|---|-----------|
| **P** | "Good developers are impossible to find. Great ones are impossible to afford. And you didn't build a great business to become a software company." |
| **E** | "We hear this every week from business owners who know they need to modernize but can't find people they trust to do it." |
| **A** | "Tell us your business problem. We build the software. You never hire a developer, manage a team, or learn to code." |
| **C** | "Get the tools your competitors have—without the tech team." |
| **E** | "So you can focus on your business while the software just works." |
