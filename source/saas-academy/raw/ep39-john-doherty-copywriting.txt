when you're evaluating a writer as a Founder how do you know if they're good a couple things one is great writing starts from a great brief which starts from great strategy do you have a good example of what a headline that introduces curiosity looks like I use the word clean copy we help agencies and inhouse marketing teams create clean marketing content and people are like what is clean marketing content and then the next paragraph explains it you know you are an expert in service businesses there's a lot of different pricing models out there hourly Project based retainer Credit Systems is there a Best pricing model for agencies it's not hourly I can tell you that what are the downfalls the problem with hourly based [Music] is we are back on the SAS Academy podcast with a person who I consider to be a great friend he was a former SAS Academy client turned coach two-time entrepreneur um marketing copyrighting SEO just he's a Savage in the game um and someone that I have great amount of respect for so John dhy welcome to the podcast man appreciate that Matt thank you for having me it's a it's a pleasure and welcome to my hometown of Denver yeah it's beautiful we got the stadium right out there it's a good view it's it's a great day man um so your journey has been interesting right I mean you've worked in companies you were at Trulia I think they acquired by Zillow spent some time at Zillow started a company Credo exited it started another company editor ninja like you've had a really cool kind of Arc through this um I want want to know something though like what do you attribute this to what do you attribute your ability to succeed to do you think it's ambition is it skill is it luck and Serendipity like what makes a journey like that um I think there's a couple things one is I just don't give up I'm stubborn I think the best entrepreneurs are stubborn and I just like if something isn't quite working I'm not like oh this isn't working I'm just going to give it up I don't like to to just like quit like that um though I've learned to like let things go um when they're really not but I'm always is going to give it as good of a try as I can for as long as I can um and whether that means like it's pivoting it it's changing models it's firing customers and going up Market or going down Market or whatever I'm just always trying new things um and I think too many entrepreneurs get stuck in the I'm just not going to try anything new like this is what I'm doing this is what I'm going to sell I'm just going to try to sell it if I can't sell it I'm going to try something else I don't believe in that I'm just always trying something new so I think that's really what it is and then also I think I'm pretty good at spotting opportun ities um and then I'm really good at starting so it's interesting because what I heard in there is this dichotomy of you need to be stubborn enough to not quit too early but also if you're too stubborn you can ride the Titanic to the bottom of the ocean right absolutely um was there a time I'm fascinated by this concept that I call startup near-death experiences right um was there a time in cedo or editor ninja whatever you decide was there a time where you thought it was all going to burn down and then you either stayed the course or made a decision that saved the company yes so fall 2019 uh was running Credo this is before the idea for editor ninja even came into my mind and basically we were in the middle of a pivot for lack of a better term where we had been kind of doing a hybrid like retainer plus commission on the back end sort of model with with agencies because Creer was a lead gen uh lead generation service for marketing agencies and um I had hired a salesperson but basically was someone to like handle like lead call lead vetting calls scheduled them with uh agencies that sort of stuff while my business partner and I were building out basically our own like software to deliver um for agencies to deliver work for them to get the lead to send proposals to sign it and then to get paid there was an Esco system in it as well long story short we had been I'd been not selling new people into the like the model that we had been running because we were moving to the new model and basically we got to the point where we had about $4,000 in the bank $4,000 and I realized like man we're burning we're not getting this thing out as fast as we need to and then I started digging into my salesperson's uh uh metrics and looking at like follow-ups on leads because I'm like man projects just aren't closing like they used to like commissions aren't coming in like they used to leads are still there and basically they just weren't doing their job like they let Bill Gates's personal blog came through looking for a marketing agency he talked to them he made introductions didn't even follow up to see if they had had conversations didn't even follow up to see if that person had uh had had even gotten the introductions they hadn't so like he let Bill Gates's personal blog die on the die on the vine in our Pipeline and I was like this is not this is not working so basically I trimmed on the team I cut my salary uh my my business partner and I both cut our salaries um and then we basically expedited the new product to Market and we turned it around within about 3 months um but it was like it was tight I was like we cannot continue doing this we have literally two weeks of expenses left and I don't know if we're going to be able to make payroll if you had to sum up what you learned from that to like teach other entrepreneurs what would it be that's a great question uh manage performance not the person or manage performance and the person I think is probably the the better way to put it um so like I had abdicated instead of delegated and wasn't like didn't have good reporting going on and wasn't uh wasn't holding them accountable for like the performance metrics I hadn't set performance metrics so I guess that's a big one as well um that was really the big lesson that I learned there um you know the pivot like doing the pivot that was all like what we needed to do and it actually like started working really well right before the pandemic killed it but um that was that was that was a tough time it was an interesting lesson yeah for sure you know we like we say in SAS Academy land like inspect what you expect you always have to get close to the close to the data close to the results the the interesting thing in sales in particular too like what what made you step back from sales at that point is it something that just didn't light you up or like what was going through your mind at that point when you did that um so the reason why I did that was simply to buy back my time what I needed to do was well I hired them when my first child was on the way I was just stopping Consulting on SEO I was finishing up a project for the New York Times and was like I'm done and uh and so and then we my business partner and I knew that we were going to start building out this this like Marketplace escrow whatever the heck it ended up being system yeah and uh and I was basically like I need to focus on this I need to focus on the product I need to focus on like what the customers want and you know basically getting this out to Market and then I will start selling that while they're keeping the ship running basically that was the idea is like they would keep the ship steady and keep it going while my business partner and I were building the jet that would take us to the next level makes sense um so that that's why I did it just so I could focus on what I felt like I was most needed in at that time got it and it's interesting because when I think of Credo from what I know about it I always think about the former that you just articulated right like matching up people who need agencies with agencies and so your bigger play with kto was to essentially build like workflow management SAS for agencies to to run more efficiently well so we took we took that idea we always did the like vetted leads intros sort of thing but basically we realized that that wasn't necessarily the big problem the agencies had they did have that problem as I always like to say if you have no leads you need leads if you have leads you need to close more leads um and so we could get them leads that wasn't a problem but they had trouble closing they had trouble retaining they had trouble getting paid right sometimes they they get paid on time sometimes they wouldn't and also clients uh people looking to hire agencies were also afraid of like not getting reporting um you know AP uh is is such a a pain in the butt or ar accounts receivable AP I'm so in the editing world at this point um that that's a big pain in the butt you know for everyone um for agencies as well so basically we realized that we could help agencies close more work they were closing on average about 15% of leads that we sent them and with the system that we built which they hated by the way but they closed half of the leads that we sent them so they made a lot more money so they were willing to put up with it which was an interesting lesson um and and then basically the clients would pay into escrow agency would deliver the work they would report on time that we required them to report by the 5ifth of the next month basically everything they did the past month and then we would pay out the agencies from the money held in escrow and we would take a percentage of that so it became yeah it was an interesting model um we ran it for about 6 eight months then the pandemic hit but it basically eclipsed our previous Revenue in about six months usually when you hear about customers using software that they hate it's in the Enterprise right it's in you know Erp systems and you could find everyone hates Salesforce and everyone still uses Salesforce you know what what did they hate about it they hated that we made them establish a process MH and CU most agencies especially smaller marketing agencies and most like a big marketing agency is 100 people in like the digital marketing World SEO content Facebook ads which is kind of where we where we swam um in that in that ocean there was uh that's big so and they all had their own processes it's often the founder still selling and they don't have a sales background and and all this stuff and basically we helped them go pro with it and we like we're like this is the process that we know works from seeing thousands of thousands of leads come through hundreds of projects being closed like we generated over quar billion dollars of leads for agencies in about seven years yeah so like we saw way more projects than any one agency has ever seen so we could take that and say this is what we know works this is a process that we know works and we bake that into the system and they just didn't like that they had to work within that within our system the proof was in the pudding and I feel like if we had been able to keep doing it for another six if we had kept doing it for another 6 12 months uh it would have it would have all like shaken out but that's that's why they hated it just cuz it was a different process plus we had to build some Integrations with like Quick Books and like that sort of stuff so they had like two different sets of books and their accountants kind of hated and that kind of stuff we were going to get there um but that but that was the smaller part it was more the we made them work within our process there's a cool detail that I want to pull out for people listening to this because I I talked to a lot of early stage Founders lately and you know there's always the ROI conversation with their clients and how do I demonstrate Roi and for some platforms it's really easy especially platforms that take payments and they can you know like my favorite example is bare metrics when I was their customer back in the day um we used their accounts receivable recovery tool and like you could go on the dashboard and it was like you've paid us 10 grand we've gotten you 80 grand I'm like awesome take my money you know easy um I it's interesting because what I love about your approach with the escrow solution is that you actually can prove the value like you you have a true mechanism where it's not a subjective assessment of is this thing working or not you can actually show them the data and I think that's something a lot of people sleep on they build a tool that works but if it doesn't work in the mind of your customer it's the same as it not working totally you know so I think it's actually a strong signal that they they were pissed off by the thing that you built because it was missing stuff but they were still so convinced by the data you were putting in front of them they kept using it that's right and we actually had it built in as well so that when they closed a project they would then say I I Clos this for six months $5,000 a month right and then we would sum that up and we had a whole reporting dashboard so it's like you've paid us you know X but you've also made but you've made y yeah um and and that was the that was another thing that differentiated that offering at least was because most you know people selling leads it's like what the hell is a lead yeah um I don't know if I can swear on this podcast but like what the hell is a lead it's like is it is it fix it in post um uh it was you know it's like is it 500 bucks a month is it $50,000 a month they both technically leads but they're dramatically different values so uh we could actually show them so we did report on that and basically we had a like all right their budget is this so therefore this lead is worth x amount $24,000 $48,000 $72,000 whatever that was so we could show that that we got them X like amount of like lead value so it wasn't just leads but it was pipeline yeah which most agencies weren't thinking about and that was actually a big differentiator for us but then we could also show them the actual Roi that they had gotten because we could also show them we have paid you out X like that is real dollars in your bank account that's cool it's like you get the aspirational and the and the real cuz can't pay the mortgage on Pipeline but it's still great to show 100% yeah so this was 2019 into 2020 right and then um what year did you sell Creed I exited Credo in September of 2022 okay so a couple years later yeah and what um like from the founder standpoint what led up to to you exiting Credo yeah so it actually goes back to as I alluded to like the the start of the pandemic so we had been running the escro model for sixish months uh in February we held in February 2020 we held like it was somewhere around $200 $250,000 in escrow and we got like 15% of that um so it was like it was growing quick and that was up from like 20,000 in September so it grew quick um and then the pandemic hit we lost about 20% of our 20 25% of our Revenue overnight because everyone just paused with their marketing agencies I got scared I made a quick decision and I like to say that we we cut our product in half and we doubled our prices um so basically we stopped doing the escrow thing um and we basically went to a straight like retainer plus commission model but higher price than before so we kind of went back to a previous model but we had this better software in place to kind of facilitate all the interest and such um and so that served to spike the revenue shortterm we also had the agencies that were in escrow basically buy out those those projects it was like pay us three months of what we would make and then it's just yours to take right and you're not paying us anything from then on so we had a month where we did almost 880,000 in Revenue um but then the business settled back in around 35 to 40,000 a month and wouldn't grow no matter what I did the economics just changed um and so it just wouldn't grow I spent I mean six figures on Facebook ads and Google ads and consultants and all of this like I'm a marketing and growth guy and I was like I can't figure this out maybe there's someone out there smarter who can figure it out no one else can figure it out either and do we straight up with you Matt I burnt out I burnt out hard it was to the point where like a customer was like riding my ass about about something um you know we had been having issues delivering for him and he also wasn't following up with leads and all that so it was kind of mutual and I just laid into him on a call just went off on him and my team literally 10 minutes later I had a meeting invite in my in my calendar in my uh my inbox from my team called catchup and I got on and my uh my account manager was like she literally said she looks me in the face we were on Zoom she looks me in the face she goes John are you okay and I was like no no Emily I'm not I'm not okay like I was I was so frustrated and burnt out and uh yeah and but I didn't even recognize it at the time um so and I I uh we had we had a customer our largest customer had been interested in buying it for a few years and so we got the deal done um but basically I sold it because I was burnt out but didn't even realize it but IID started editor Ninja at the start of 2022 well I launched the website in June of 2020 but it was like a side project and then in December of 2021 I was like I need something to reinvigorate me as an entrepreneur and just like start something build something that I know can get traction that I know will grow and then basically over the course of 2022 my time between Eder ninja and crto was like 80% crto 20% Eder ninja in January and by the time we sold in September it was like 5050 6040 edor ninja Credo um and I knew that was what I wanted to move on to next and I needed that to know what I was moving on to next when we think about burnout like I this is I think pretty common with entrepreneurs right is we're we're really bad at self-regulating the amount of work that we do and the amount of emotion that we put into it until we developed that skill um obviously it was a challenging time in the world it was a challenging time in your industry um but like what are the tools that you have now from like a how you manage John D standpoint not necessarily a business thing that you would employ to to try not to hit that point of burnout yeah that's a great it's a great question um so and I've seen a lot more people talking about this about burnout which I really I really respect and I really like sometimes people will say like oh I'm burned out I'm gonna take a vacation vacation's not going to fix true burnout yeah like September 22 I sold it it was probably and now we're in June of 24 so like close to two years later it was probably around February of this year about four months ago that I was like I think I'm finally back to who JN is it took a long long time um and so kind of the things I've put into place a couple of them one is just I've just divorced my emotions and my selfworth from how the business does I was that it was Credo was so personal to me because I mean I got laid off and I started working on it the next day right back in 2015 and I was selling leads to my friends who ran marketing agencies like it was in the space that I established my career and that I was well known internationally in it was so personal and I had I had to get away from that um with editor ninja it's interesting because I'm not an editor I'm a writer so I'm a decent like developmental editor like structure and argument and that sort of stuff but like when it comes to like copy editing I like to joke like MLA APA WTF like I don't know um like I do a little bit now because I've been running the business for long enough but like I couldn't jump in and like you know tell you if this is like written in Chicago or MLA I just don't know so I by default I've been like out of the out of the delivery a lot more like I'm just like I'm building the systems um and then also with like a a bigger team i' I've moved into more like building the business building the team building the culture which is much more aligned with who I am um and so getting back to what I was saying about what people are finally talking about with burnout is um it's not working too hard that burns you out it's working too hard on something that's not aligned with your values or with what it is that you care about amen so with Credo it wouldn't grow and I'm a growth guy and I mean it it hurt me personally that I couldn't figure it out um so yeah it was just it was a complete like misalignment there um and I kept at it for too long because I'm stubborn like I said um and got to the point where I was like I just I have to be rid of this thing and so was fortunate enough to be able to do that yeah we uh we go hard on the emotions as entrepreneurs man you know and especially I find this it's anecdotal but I feel like especially firsttime Founders it's always freaking personal yeah right we always if the business is good I'm good if the business is valuable I'm value if the business is I'm totally right I was like that it sounds like you were like that with fro a lot of people I talk to were like that and I think there's value in there is some value in that though because also tells you what like what gets you out of bed in the morning like for example um I love selling I love sales so like when we're closing New Deals I'm I'm I have a great day I have an awesome day like new customers are coming on man I have a great day if they're turning it hurts um and so like I really so but that also tells me I really care about building a valuable service that people want to keep buying for a long time so like there is always a positive to the negative there but when you let it start affecting you personally you can't get your brain off of it that kind of thing it's it's really problematic um so meditation really helped out um has really helped out over the last year and a half I've done a ton of like deep work um with a couple of like different mentors Philip mccaran who we talked about at breakfast went to his brave soul in in Ireland last June Castle's amazing dude it just like yeah so I've just done a lot of like deep work and dealing with a lot of like childhood trauma um which has really like opened me up as a person um and I'm a much healthier person and a much better entrepreneur in Boss because of it yeah I love it man it's uh it's fascinating the like how tightly coupled our mental and emotional health as entrepreneurs is with not just the success of the business but also how well we can advocate for our teams and the culture we build I mean it's it's everywhere 100% yeah before we move on from your entrepreneurial journey I want to um I wanted to ask you this was was Credo I'm ask it differently what was the first dollar you made on the internet first dollar I made on the internet it may it wasn't Credo it was uh it was actually it was SEO Consulting Consulting so and it's actually it's actually a funny like kind of Full Circle moment so I had a client at the agency I worked for in New York who one of the co-founders his parents were real estate agents in in Marin County just north of the Bay Area just North of San Francisco and they needed some SEO help so I charged them 50 bucks an hour got them ranking number one for Marin real estate worked with them for uh I don't know 6 8 12 months something like that and uh and then I went to work for Zillow and outranked them again uh but that was like that was the first like really like professional dollars I may have made some like before that but like you know I wasn't slinging like info products at 16 years old or something like that but um you know I was also 16 and 2000 and there weren't the tools you know then but um but I I I had started blogging at that point like I started blogging like 1999 2000 so um you know that was my that was like my start of like building an audience and then ultimately becoming a marketer and you know building building businesses as like an audience focused like entrepreneur yeah I love it I think the The Arc is super common right where you start out selling the service in the area of the expertise that eventually you go on to create the business around that's right well when I was Consulting and then I realized that I didn't like I had gotten like raises at the agency I was running the agency's office and didn't need the money and I was spending a couple weekends a month in my apartment in Brooklyn I was single 28 in Brooklyn and and basically in my apartment by myself couple weekends a month doing uh work for clients that I liked but I didn't need the money yeah and so crto came out of me stopping doing that and also 3 weeks after I stopped Consulting I met my wife that's awesome so I actually had time to hang out with her which was great so you guys met in Brooklyn we met in Brooklyn and then we moved to San Francisco that's cool I met my wife in The Bronx man world go to New York if you want to meet your wife that's what I'll take you from this that's what I learned I love it all right so we're going to switch gears and talk about writing this is something that I'm excited about I love to write I don't know if I am a good writer or not necessarily but I know that makes me feel good and I I love to try to get my thoughts out there and I'm always trying to to sharpen the ax so what our team did um is opened up chat GPT and basically said hey teach me the top five things I need to know to be a better writer and I think in the tech World we're all using chat PT there's a lot of what I would consider to be mediocre word salad out there just looked in some LinkedIn com comments yeah so much um but I I think that there's probably something decent buried in there that just need to find so what I'm want to do is I'm going to take the top five things that chat GPT said we would need to focus on I just want to like Riff on them with you one by one um so first thing it said focus on benefits not features don't just list what your product does talk about how it helps the customer we've probably heard that before like what comes up for you when you think about features versus benefits uh it's incomplete because you also need to talk about use cases and who it's for I I completely agree and actually I do a fair few um I call them SEO opportunity analyses I do them for a lot of like software companies these days um just like on the side from editor ninja and um a lot of them have there's a lot of gold to be found especially from the SEO perspective there's a lot of gold to be found with writing about features like there's usually search volume around that um and so having individual Pages for those features explaining in depth what it does CU people want to see before they're willing to buy um but what a lot of people Miss is who exactly you're serving um and I actually just listened to your your episode with Dev you know from a few weeks ago he said exactly the same thing and and I don't know if I learned from him or he learn it from me or we both like learned it separately but someone comes to your site and they're like what is this what does it do and who is it for and then really the the subo of who is it for is is it for me and so if you can help people identify that that that's for them um then you're you're going to do you're going to do a lot better like if you go to to the editor ninja homepage currently not saying it won't change but I think the second or third panel that we have on the homepage as you scroll down is what kind of business are you and it's like in-house SEO corporate Communications NGO like the main types the idea there is like people are like all right what is this okay they do this they can watch the explainer video right there and then they're like oh boom I'm an in-house content person and they can click there and then we have a page dedicated to them about how we work with in-house content teams how in-house content teams best leverage us the value that they get that kind of thing so got it and that probably changes the like the who it's for changes the benefits right they care about different things 100% yep yep so if you're like just focused on SAS Founders for example your whole freaking site can be about that right you don't need to talk about like B2B or b2c or whatever like your whole thing could be about that but for a little bit more horizontal business like mine um you have to focus you have to focus down like that because there there are different benefits even if you're delivering the work and like it's the same work it's just different benefits for them yeah that makes sense all right I love that the second one um your headline is the first thing people read and is the only thing that determines if they keep reading so what makes a good headline a do you think that's true and if so what makes a good headline it is the first thing they read for sure I mean heat map show us that um well unless you have a face on the page in which case they look at the face first and they look at where the face is looking then they look at the headline so always have like the image looking at the headline is something I learned I think I learned that from Kyle raky um propos say that again that was that was yeah yeah so you've got your homepage right and usually it's like a like a 2/3 1/3 like sort of split or like half and half and uh we read left to right in America right in English so it's usually like headline subheading or paragraph button and then you keep scrolling or like email capture but on the right side so I have a video on my homepage but a lot of companies will have a photo an image right and conversion optimization Studies have shown us that if you have them look if you have that image like looking at the person like out of the screen it's way less effective than if they're if they're looking to their right which is looking at the head at the headline because people are drawn to faces and then they're like okay I see your face now where are you looking I want to look at that and then they go to your headline yeah fascinating so if you have an image on your homepage or any like page have it looking at where you want the person to read next um thing about great headlines there's two parts to it one from an SEO perspective get your main keywords in there right so we talk so I have content editing content writing on ours but then also I like to introduce a little bit of curiosity so they're like wait that's interesting tell me more right is kind of what you want them to do to get them to read the next thing and then to get them to take the next action so and I think that's one that a lot of people Miss they just try to to SEO it too hard but you can have you can have good copyrighting principles along with the the SEO like best practices as well do you have a good example of what a headline that introduces curiosity looks like uh so one that we've used on Eder ninja before I don't even remember what our current H1 is but um create create better what was it it was something about like like creating I use the word clean copy M create like we help you know agencies and inh marketing teams create clean marketing content and people are like what is clean marketing content and then the next paragraph explains it got it so it's like so it's introducing a slightly new term that they might not be familiar with but they're like I like clean I don't want dirty I want clean so and then and then they keep on reading down so so the job of the headline isn't to tell the whole story is to get them to read the whole story 100 well it's it's to introduce it it's kind of like the lead into like a a blog post or something like that like if you tell a story at the start of a of a blog post then they're going to want to keep on reading you know or or so it's simar of like psychology obviously you're not like telling the full story but it's like it's to like they understand it but they're also curious yeah and then so so point three from our our chat GPT writing coach is actually very closely related to what you just said and it says tell stories paint pictures humans are wired to respond to stories so like lean into Vivid details metaphors and examples yep I think you can go overboard but like if you don't have those and your writing isn't nearly as strong it's not nearly as persuasive MH the same psychology uh applies to like testimonials and case studies and that sort of stuff so you show faces you tell stories you talk about the kinds of projects you've done or you know how your software helped so and so do X and grow their business by Y and you know sell it for a life-changing amount of money people are going to respond to that all right so the next one that it told us it said and I don't know that I understand this one so I want your point of view it says write in a conversational style I understand that part I'm not an idiot but WR in a conversational style use U language in instead of we language right like you would talk to a friend like is that good advice sometimes I think it kind of depends on the business um so if it's like a an insurance company or something like that you know you probably want to be more authoritative in your content um if it's if it's more like um yeah a more like b2c company I think it's I think that's great advice um but really it comes down to like the type of content and like the level of content that it is so if it's sales copy no um but if it's like educational content and you're like teaching someone you should blah blah blah then it's it can be really it can be really good advice the one thing to think about there is um when it com when it comes to calls to action and buttons and that sort of stuff you don't don't write it as if a like you should get started the person is the person who's looking at it look at it from their point of view and it's I want to get started I want to find an editor I want to improve my cash flow like make that make that the cash make that the the call to action got it our fifth question is about call to action but you already you already hit it um what chat GPT said about call to action was tell them exactly what action it takes or like say things that are clear like by now or sign up today but that seems a little counter to what you're saying you're saying that the the CTA should be more outcom driven it's it's actually the same thing it's just like what what do they want to do next I want to improve cash flow um I think for like if it is like a like a checkout button like by now that kind of thing um so we actually on editor ninja I actually use get started um which it I mean it's always debated and like test it for your own site but what I have found is with editor ninja we get people coming who are looking for editing we also get people coming who are looking to get hired as an editor so get started is like all right take me where I want to go and then we uh I don't think I do it right now but I'm thinking about changing it back take them to a form where it's like what are you looking for I want to get my content edit okay cool how much do you have and then boom drop them to a demo mhm or I want to apply as an editor and it drops them to like the appli page um so once again it comes down to that like curiosity and like kind of helping people if they're like oh I'm stuck I don't know oh get started that sounds good so did the machine give us good advice did we get good advice from chat GPT I don't think it's terrible advice think it needs some Nuance but it's a good start yeah yeah yeah cool um awesome so you run editor ninja where it's basically copy editing as a service um I want to start high level on this because it's a question that I had when does somebody need an editor versus when should they just hire a writer to run the whole play uh when you're scaling when when you're scaling you need more editing muscle you need more editing muscle exactly yeah and and once you're once you really have traction um and it really so editing really I mean it's important for a few reasons one is it helps writers get better um so you know writers need coaching we all need coaching and and whatever thing we're doing um and so a good editor is going to help a writer improve and so I actually tell people if you're working with freelance writers it's also good to have an have someone editing whether it's you internally if you can do that and you want to give them like feedback on it or someone external because the more training basically you can give your writers the better content they're going to give you out of the box and then eventually they're not going to need as much editing which is like kind of works us out of a job but like that's okay because they're getting better work and ultimately the goal the 30,000 foot view is like the big vision is get better content out on the internet yeah so um but obviously you have to start with right before you can hire editing we actually introduced writing about 6 weeks ago because we saw people we would lose customers when people lost their Freelancers their Freelancers quit or got sick or they fired him or whatever so you know we're like you know what screw it we're just we'll just offer to create the content for you um but it definitely starts with with writing but any writer needs uh needs editing as well I think most of the people to listen to this podcast either have hired writers have tried to be writers or we'll need to do one of those two things in the near future so what I want to know when you're evaluating a writer and you're not a writer so like when you're evaluating a writer as a Founder how do you know if they're good couple things one is great writing starts from a great brief which starts from great strategy so know what you want created first know where you're going is it a lot of blog posts is it like case studies like that kind of thing different writers different writers are better for different types of content so first understand kind of the type of content that you're needing to create um so like people so writers that write blog posts those aren't copywriters copywriters are writing sales copy it's a different skill set than blog content um so I mean you can call those bloggers or whatever I I just call them writers but but that's different from a copywriter so you so you also have to so once you know the type of content you're going to be creating you know the type of writer that you hire then putting together a brief of like this is what the page is this is what it's trying to communicate Maybe here's a rough outline here are the keywords we're going after and then give that to them and see what they come back with one thing one tip that we've learned is so we have couple hundred like writers and editors in our like extended network of people not ones that we work directly with but we've referred work um you know to that Network before and uh you know we ask for uh writing samples or work samples right um but the problem with that is like ask for it get their portfolio but know that that is their best work and you don't know if it's been edited or not so before you commit to someone uh get them to do a paid test project so pay them as if you know they they were working for you like longterm give them the brief Etc and see what their initial output is and see how much work it needs and then decide if you can work with that or not cuz some writers will return you basically ready to publish content others it's pretty rough and they need feedback and it's usually based on seniority and price but not always um so that's like kind of a gauge but test them out yourself first and pay them for it that's interesting so I think that the expectation for most people who are not in this world is that you hire a writer they write it comes back it's ready to get published rock and roll doesn't happen really rarely rarely happens if you've been working with someone for a long time and they really understand your content and they or they understand your business they understand the kind of content you're looking for they understand your customer you can get pretty close um but especially at the start even if they're a great writer they're getting to know your space they're getting to know you they're getting to and and you're also learning your own preferences for content right like certain words you like or you don't like um and so at the beginning you really going to have to give them a lot of feedback so we should just expect that to be part of the work going in 100% 100% yeah what is a what does a writer like this cost in the market uh a decent like kind of SEO focused article is going to run you somewhere from like 300 to 700 bucks thought leadership stuff case studies that kind of thing can go into the thousands like a a professional case study is can cost you in the I don't know multiple thousands um kind of thing but like if we're talking you know blog content thousand to 1500 words keyword focused you know maybe a subject matter expert in there that kind of thing somewhere in the 3 to 700 range what's interesting is when I asked you that question the your response which was awesome but your response was Project focused right it was output focused I think a lot of people who especially who run SAS companies tend to mentally index more on hiring full-time team members yeah is that something let's say a SAS company doing a million doll in Revenue relatively small is there a space for hiring someone fulltime are you going to find the talent or is the better Talent going to be in the freelance world yeah not at that size okay I would say once you're in the mid seven figures probably is when it would make sense to have someone that's like dedicated to writing you may hire a like a a marketing manager or something like that um you know with a number of years of experience is usually kind of what you can afford at that point um but expect that they're more going to be like like they can be owning strategy but they'll be working with you on owning strategy and really they're getting it done and getting it done often means hiring other people so like you hire a marking manager they're great at technical SEO for example because you have a programmatic SEO play for your software company um but they're not a developer they're not a designer they're not a they're probably not a writer that sort of stuff or could they do all of those things um and so they also need to be good at like hiring and so when you're thinking about hiring for marketing um whether it's content or whatever it's both the people cost and then also also the budget cost to get all the things done so what the mistake a lot of Founders make is that they will hire a marketing manager and just expect them to do everything and they don't have any other budget for anything else but actually like I would prefer to hire so say a market manager is going to cost you $60,000 a year five grand a month right Plus benefits and all that so like it goes up to what 70 75 yeah but uh if that if five grand a month is your full marketing budget a you're already over budget because you didn't account for benefits and all those things I would rather pay like a you know a fractional content manager a freelance like content strategist two 2,000 a month and then use that addition have them deploy that additional $3,000 a month to actually get writing done as opposed to hire someone at 5,000 a month and expect them to do all the things yeah it's interesting because it reminds me almost of your story with your salesperson at Credo right where it's like you want to just get a person and say marketing solved or sales is solved because there's a button the seat good to go yep and it's just it always never works abdicate versus delegate you want to delegate you don't want yep yeah for sure so editor ninja is interesting right I mean I think we've talked a lot about editing versus writing now you're doing both which is super cool one of the things that that I found fascinating is that you know you're still relatively early with it but you've closed some big deals like webflow being one of them like what was your process and experience closing a deal like that in a relatively young company yeah um and it's interesting because we have different processes I think I mean any company needs this this and I've been learning this kind of the hard way recently with losing some deals but uh the bigger the bigger the deal the different the process is going to be or just the size of the deal determines the the process that you need to run um like for example for smaller I was telling you over breakfast that we rolled out smaller uh plans smaller packages as small as $5,000 a month forish blog posts a month uh fully edited um and that one is like all right we're a great fit here's the signup link just get going and then do your onboarding call and we get them going I'm not going to negot terms and like that sort of stuff we've actually stopped sending like Master service agreements contracts and statements of work and that sort of stuff it's just too much and and it actually really it slows down the deal in a way it doesn't need to slow it down because then then they're like oh it's a contract we can Redline this no but versus like a like a web flow or someone like that um much more willing to jump through hoops um you know fill out their like vendor profile or whatever that is because couple of things one is they're happy to sign long-term agreements um and then also once they get you integrated into their system well a they've planned so they're not going to turn in like two months CU like oh no more content right like web flow has like you know a multiple six figure year content budget right so like they're not just going to cut content um so it so I'm willing to do a lot more work up front and kind of do a little bit more like not custom quoting but like taking into account their you know red lines on contracts and that sort of stuff which Pro tip uh it's kind of free legal Consulting um because if you're seeing the same red lines multiple times you're like oh we actually need to add this in right I'm going to get my own lawyer to look at it and here's the language that another lawyer's already given us for free as we were trying to get them to pay us money um but yeah so it's a different it's a different sales process but that that one was actually pretty quick yeah um that one was like I remember starting it in like January or so of 2023 2023 um I remember sitting in my hot tub up in the mountains like on my phone filling out a vendor profile like on like a Friday night with a glass of whiskey beside me um it's not a bad day and then no not bad at all and then they closed in like March or April um so yeah but like basically it's like I'm willing to do more work Upfront for those longer deals but also um get the longer deal right they're happy to sign a six 12 months and also one more Pro tip for you uh big companies like that they have rules around like uh their procurement has rules um and so if you offer them a discount they are obligated to take the discount so they'll sign a 12-month like agreement if you give them a two and a half % 5% like discount if they pay up front and they will do that and then you get to frontload that cash nice that is that is interesting so reading it back more work up front got to jump through the lawyer stuff got to go back and forth on contracts all that stuff and and I think if you sell the smbs it's going to feel excruciatingly slow and painful compared to someone coming through and mashing the buy now button filling out the credit card form totally you go through that and you're saying that you can leverage a small discount to ideally get longer terms and front load cash collected which is is super cool their switching cost is probably higher because they're you're going to be fully integrated into their whole machine and they're less likely to have massive strategic pivots so if you lose the deal it's probably on you most likely 100% um so it's more durable Revenue that's right that's right and also to your question of like as a as a small like fairly early on company I've spent 15 years building my name in the space yeah so like so a lot of it early on especially like I always tell especially first-time Founders like start a business in the space that you've been in that you actually know some people in because your reputation your name is going to carry you through those first like tough years until you actually find like Market fit and figure out your marketing engine and all of that yeah and that's still like I mean that still helps you like I was I was you know Doom scrolling Twitter the other day when I couldn't sleep and I saw someone singing your Praises about how awesome an SEO audit that you had done for them how much it helped them you know I mean it's still 15 years in the game like people are still talking about you which is super cool um I love it so what makes a great funnel you know with like Enterprise or SMB I think maybe we focus on the smaller clients cuz I think that's likely what's going to help more people who are listening to this but you know within that context what makes a great funnel it all comes down to who you're selling to for like uh you know I think about like um clickfunnels and like businesses like that right it's like here's this squeeze page and here's this upsell page and like that sort of stuff um you know you try to take that and you apply it to like a director VP level and it's just not going to work um so really you need to start with who the customer is who the ultimate buyer is and then build the buying process that's what a funnel is it's a buying process build the buying process that they want and that that they that they go for so like a content manager or a founder or someone like that they're going to want smaller deal like smaller deal size uh you know shorter terms paid month-to month um put down a credit card check out without talking to somebody that's what they want um versus like you know a director of content like we basically go for like like director plus is our best um and so I've tried the self-served model many times including again recently and but then I dug into the data I'm like man but it's like director plus and they're not just going to sign up they have to like you know it's in their budget and they have to get approval from their boss and all the sort of stuff they want to talk to a human they're probably considering multiple vendors that kind of thing so for me a good funnel is simply it's built for the type of person that you're trying to convert um so if they want a demo and they they're you know like I think about it as like like a founder or like an individual contributor they're in maker mode right and they just want to get it done they want to sign up they want to plug it in they want to you know authenticate their sign in and like just get dropped into your software and just go great like if that's who your audience is let them do that don't put the friction there but like U you know a director someone like that even like a senior manager their job is meetings they are not allergic to meetings right they actually like meetings because they realize that like a good meeting gets way more done than like clicking around trying to figure it out yourself so they're happy to hop on a 15 20 minute call to get their questions answered and to learn a bit more versus like an individual contributor or super busy founder like especially like a like a software like a development Focus founder isn't going to want to do that when you decided to stop doing trials and start doing demos what was the data you were seeing that showed you that selling through a sales call was the right move couple things one is um I went and I did a deep dive on who our best customers are and basically identified as like it's Founders but they're of like a certain like budget level that sort of stuff so they have a team it's not like a solo founder um cuz they turn quickly actually for us um so I I looked at that and just like I I've been keeping good data on like leads and title and whether they closed or not whether theyve churned or not and why they didn't sign or why they did sign so I had all of that data I just needed to go and analyze it but when it comes to like rolling out a change like this um I'm a big fan of you have to have kind of Milestones along the way at which point you say like this is a go or this is not a go um so uh I don't know if you're familiar with Annie Duke thinking in bets uh just wrote a book called quit so I attended a live like session with her through uh mmt Mastermind talks uh recently and she was talking about how like um basically the book quit is all about making good decisions and so first of all you want to avoid resulting and saying like I didn't get the result that I wanted therefore was a bad decision because you can make a great decision and still get unlucky and have a bad result right um I'm re listening to her book thinking in bets right now on Audible as well so this is pretty top of Mind as I'm making these these changes right but she talked about in that that uh that session that I attended basically like you make a decision say we're we're going in this direction but instead of like you know resulting in saying like only if we get this result was it a good decision you look you have Milestones along the way to say like this is working so for me for example I went back and you know I was I rolled out like a a more self-served process which I'm going to keep I'm just going to deprioritize it um and just go back to the primary call to action being schedule a call as opposed to sign up now like schedule a call or sign up now right now it's sign up now or schedule a call so I'm going to flip that um but I also basically streamlined our like our the pages on our site and made it clear like all right I need editing I need writing I need like to update old content um so I basically have those like three main pages and then my analytics I looked at okay is traffic and R views shifting to these Pages where I want them if yes keep going if no fix it and then are people clicking like the buy now button great if not fix it so on and so forth and so basically I've been running it for long enough now I've had enough views on those pages I've had enough clicks on the buttons and no one sub it it's not working and I've tried a bunch of different things and it's just not working what's your threshold when you run a test like that on a marketing website like is there a certain amount of traffic or a certain amount of clicks you need to have in order to trust the data uh I mean a a true like conversion Optimizer is going to tell you you need a lot more traffic than I do it on for me it's basically like I kind of go off I I look at like conversion rate so say like you know if our conversion rate is 2% right like views to signups so if you get 100 views you're going to get two signups I'm going to let it run for basically I'm going to at 100 I'm going to look and be like did we get two signups so is it like steady did we get more than that did we get less than that right um and then I'm going to let it run for a while longer I usually let it run I'd let that run up to like 500 to a th000 views at which point like knowing with the other system we should have X customers if we don't have that same amount of customers or more something is off and so then I'll iterate I'll iterate um but once again it comes down to like who are you ultimately selling to and what do they want to buy one of the biggest things that I think is a mistake that I see Founders make is they don't start paying attention to that data until they run the test right and one thing that I love about what you just said is that you have enough familiarity around it because you watch it already so you know what normal looks like and that helps you make a more well-informed decision about what an abnormality shows up like you got have context around the data to really make that decision you got it yep how many views are we getting how many signups are we getting what's the average like customer value that kind of thing and so then also like if we take it out to its like to its end okay so say you're you know it was getting you were getting 2% now you're getting 3% great but are they paying the same amount if you look at it long enough over like the cohort are they staying for the same amount of time are they increasing their spin with you like the others are whatever that is so you have to look not just at those like initial conversion metrics because if you're not keeping an eye on the ones further down the line you could end up signing a lot of cheap customers who turn fast as opposed to fewer customers who pay you more and they grow and they don't churn right very different like like the the raw just like conversion numbers it's it's a step right but you have to keep looking further down the line because you could like optimize your way out of business yeah man that's uh that's super true it's like a it's like the iceberg metaphor right there's a there's a lot under the surface or a lot after the sale in this case 100% to really inform it but under and this is why you have to understand the like how long they stay how much the average customer pays you lifetime gross profit all that sort of stuff or has a great video about this on on YouTube um that I watched and I was like oh I need to dig into this and I went and figured all that out and so like I know our lifetime gross profit I know how long they stay I know our best customer like all of that and so like that just drives all the other decisions that I make so I think I just want to clarify that for the people listening so I think how long they stay is is pretty self-evident but talk about um lifetime gross profit or even just gross profit in general like what are you looking for there yeah so lifetime gross profit is basically um how much they pay you minus your cost to deliver times the amount of time they stay so someone pays you $1,000 a month it costs you $500 to deliver it they stay for six months your lifetime gross profit is $3,000 and then from that you can make the that's what you make the decision off of how much you you're willing to pay to acquire someone so if you want your C payback to be 60 days right um You should be willing to pay $1,000 to acquire a new customer because you're going to pay $1,000 you're going to make 2,000 in gross profit yeah so what just happened in the last 60 seconds was a very succinct explanation of the right way to do things because when you don't do it this way and you make all of these decisions based on Topline Revenue instead of gross profit it's this fascinating conundrum where all the math looks great on the spreadsheet and then you hit all your numbers and you're like I actually can't pay myself I don't have any profit how did this possibly happen you know am I doing a bad job running the business all of the efficiency metrics and it doesn't matter SAS agency freaking lemonade stand you got to subtract the cost of lemons right like all of this stuff should be done against your gross profit so that way you can actually see how much money can you a use to pay yourself and B use to pay for the operations of the business can I give you another Pro tip around profit and actually having profit in your business when you're building a budget which build a budget first but when you're building a budget don't do it from 100% of like of Revenue do it from 90% of Revenue build in like 10% of profit so say you're making $100,000 a month don't spend $100,000 a month including your salary you're budgeting 90 because there's always going to be a little bit of creep there so maybe you spend 92 but then you still have $88,000 versus if you went to 100,000 and spend and you get to 102 or 105 you're losing money so on the one you're making eight grand the other one you're losing five grand so don't don't budget in everything that that budget in profit is basically what I'm saying yeah and it's interesting when we had clay mask um on the podcast he had said something similar but has he said that it's also more important as the business scales to build in more of a buffer and more of a safety net he said that was one of the biggest challenges he had when he was scaling infusion soft and when it rebranded to keep um when they were like off Target for a little while there was he had underestimated the amount of time that it takes a larger business to shift and course correct versus when it's a small startup so like I think your advice is is dialed with no asterisk like any business should have the budget or have the have the buffer but then as you grow don't stop doing that thing right you probably will need more buffer because it's going to take you more time to unroll a decision if you if you go in a bad direction also start it now yeah right like people are like oh I can't afford to right now you can't afford not to build that profit in right now because if you're building a business that doesn't have profit in it now it's going to hurt really badly a you might like grow yourself out of business but or not pay yourself and burn out but also uh it's going to hurt a lot more when it's a significantly bigger or and you're like wow we have no problem we're losing money CU we don't have that buffer and in order to get that profit in the business to build a a sustainable like you know uh business then you have to like reduce people and that hurts really bad so if you build it in from the start then you're going to build that buffer um and and it keeps building your cash buffer over time right and I basically with every new with every business I start I Sprint to two months of expenses in the bank Sprint to that that's my minimum that comes from the book profit first um I Sprint to that and then ultimately I try to have about three in there I've had as much as six before it just felt like too much we weren't really spinning it I've had less than that it's really stressful so that's kind of The Sweet Spot that I found for myself with my own psychology and just like how I build companies yeah I love that man um I want to talk about pricing because that's the other that's the other side of this equation right is you can do a great job on profit buffers and cost control and all that kind of stuff but if you're pricing model or you're not getting the revenue into begin with you're still going to have the same the same bad outcome and so you know you are an expert in service businesses there's a lot of different pricing models out there hourly Project based retainer Credit Systems is there a Best pricing model for agencies it's not hourly I can tell you that hourly it is not it is not hourly um I'm a big fan I mean people talk about value based pricing all the time um I really like kind of Project based um because then people are getting like it's defined deliverables defined outcome right it's up to like them or you to deliver it's like it's a it's a set like scope right there so then you don't get scope creep um and then also kind of building and then also quoting it on like a a flat rate right there because you know it's basically like you're productizing the delivery of it custom work is really hard to make happen um so the more you can like Focus down and Niche on like these are the services we offer these are the services we don't offer um then you're actually going to be able to run a profitable a profitable company um yeah I mean it's that's how I that's that's how I prefer to do it I do like the like recurring the great thing about recurring is that the money's coming in every month yeah the bad thing about recurring is that you have to keep delivering the value every month so um and and you have to keep messaging the value that you're bringing them and you have to be communicating that value and all of that so um yeah like I mean the the Nirvana just like in SAS and agencies it it is recurring Revenue but you have to build your systems around that to be delivering that value month in month out yeah what are the biggest um pricing mistakes that you see agency owners make billing hourly after the work is completed on net 30 to 60 terms okay break break all that down think about it you start work on January 1 right you're billing $150 an hour and you do 100 hours for them 15 grand great I just made $155,000 and then you Bill them on February 1st and then you get paid on March 15th that's 75 days of uh uh of salaries and expenses and AD spin sometimes if agencies do that by the way if you're an agency and you're running ads for clients put on their credit card not on yours um especially because if you get stiff like yeah the points are attractive but if you get stiff that's really going to hurt um but like that just that delay to to actual cash in the bank like yeah it looks great on paper but if you're not actually getting that until March 15th that's a really stressful business to run you have to have a big cash buffer line of credit there um so that's I mean that that's it's just a terrible stressful model so I like I get payment up front right this is this is what we're doing uh this is what we're going to do for you this how much it's going to cost you know and once the first in once the first uh you know invoice is paid then we start work I do Flex on that a little bit for bigger projects um but I always try to get some percentage up front and honestly what I try to do is I get I Get Enough up front that it covers my costs until I get the next until I get the next installment paid interesting what um aside from like time to cash in the bank your reaction to the pricing question not hourly was interesting what are the downfalls of doing an hourly based pricing model for an agency the problem with hourly based is uh two things well really the big thing is for both sides your incentives are misaligned so the customer right the the client like a SAS company hiring an agency the SAS company is incentivized to have them work as few hours as possible you're not going to get the best result from that yeah the agency is incentivized to work as many hours as possible but not necessarily to be efficient so it's just it's it's it's just cross incentives right there so instead billing based off of like deliverables outcomes like that sort of thing um is is just going to be better for everybody um the other thing I'll say is like from the freelancer like the agency side um if you're billing hourly and you're really good at what you do and you're really efficient at what you do you're costing yourself money you're leaving money on the table and you're basically being penalized for being really good when actually you should be getting paid more for being really good which is why you sell results and outcomes or deliverables not time I love that um the other interesting question that I think a lot of people have is they they try to figure out what's the right price point and I think that's an impossible question to answer especially on a podcast without a specific example so I can give you a specific example though but keep going well I think what would probably be more helpful for people watching this is how do you know if you're undercharging or overcharging like what are the signs that are going to tell you that your pricing is wrong yeah so everyone starts with too low of pricing it's just a rule everyone starts selling cheap because you're afraid people aren't going to buy and you're learning and you're not confident in the value you bring and all of that which fine great keep going um and then over time raise keep raising your prices when I was uh running Credo and was coaching a lot of agency owners basically I told them an unlock for a lot of them was uh your new prospects the person you're quoting today doesn't know what you quoted the last person for the same work you can increase your prices by 10% especially if it's like custom work and that sort of stuff you don't have public facing pricing um you can you can do that um you can also if you have public facing pricing then you just update it right don't don't raise prices on your existing people but just start selling at the new price and it's not oh we're trying out this pricing it's no this is the new price and that's an important shift to make you're just selling it at that um and then eventually you're going to hit a point and of course be watching um especially if it's public facing pricing watch lead flow what happens to your conversion your converion percentage number of leads coming in number of qualified leads coming in and then also how many of those you're closing and at what at what at what level and then also how long they stay um check for the change in objections and then uh and eventually you're going to hit a ceiling you're going to hit a ceiling for the value you're currently providing so you have one you have a choice at that point you either say all right this is our price we can't deliver any more value or we don't want to add on other things this is what we're going to sell at or you figure out how you add on more value and then you can charge more if you want to keep going up I've learned an important lesson recently with pricing where our pricing was like was $4.99 a month for 20,000 words a month something like that and uh people are signing up no problem they were also turnning because they were smaller and all that right bigger ones turn a lot a lot less than than smaller as we already discussed but um I basically started bumping up that pricing I got as high as 700 a month for the same same amount of editing done um and we saw leads drop we saw conversions drop people stayed longer but that didn't offset the drop in new customers and then also you know just churn like accounting for churn of customers um we weren't replacing Revenue nearly as fast so I've actually learned I have a I have a lever to play with pricing if we need to get more customers in we've had more turn or something like that I can reduce the price right um and get more people in and it's still profitable there it's not as profitable but it's more profitable there and so we can get more Revenue in but then if we're having capacity issues or delivery issues or something like that I can crank the price back up and I know that leads are going to drop we not going to close as many so pricing can actually become a lever for you based off of your ability to deliver if you know that you have a ton of big bugs in the product right now Jack your price up it sound it's completely counter intive but Jack the price up so you get fewer people so that then you have the time to fix it and you're not going to turn out as many people and Jack the price up and lower your marketing budget fix it and then reverse that man and the people that you get coming in are likely to be your most qualified probably in that top 10% who would have already bought no matter what and probably more likely to deal with your that you haven't fixed in the product yet 100% 100% so you're using pricing essentially as a funnel filter to dial lead flow up and down yeah yeah we always think about funnel filters as like how many people do you have or what's your budget or something like that which are legit like funnel filters I use them too and of course like finding the right ones is it is its own challenge but you can use price for that as well H so only funnel filter that doesn't cost you money 100% 100% yeah damn that's wild I mean think about like Enterprise customers right there's a reason their minimum project starts at $100,000 because they don't want someone that wants to spend $5,000 right like it is the ultimate funnel filter and you can use it to dial up and down volume need need more leads you have new sales people coming on you need more leads to get them trained up lower your price you C you can't handle all the volume that's coming in you can't hire good salespeople put it back up they don't know that's a mic drop moment right there John that's good um I want to wrap with this you know obviously most people who watch this podcast are SAS Founders or listen to it um and there's I feel like there's a bit of a a Resurgence of services like being okay again in in sass land and I I always found it funny um that it was ever not okay I think I was just like you know some VC lore that got internalized amongst Founders everywhere um I mean has service in the name but when you talk to SAS Founders who want to start doing services and I'm not talking about like setup fees I'm talking about like having real long-term Professional Services that help their customers win what pricing advice and packaging advice would you give them like how do you set this up in a way that works and doesn't put your software Revenue at risk yeah so there's a couple things one is we were talking about this at breakfast two is uh too many I see too many SAS Founders basically viewing it as a loss leader um when actually I think you need to view it as a profit Center um you're not going to deliver the best value that you can um if you're not making money right and if you're like man if we like sell more people into this we're just going to lose more money you're never going to sell it you're never going to you're never going to uh you know make it a success um and then the other thing I see people doing is um they use it to try to save contracts instead of increasing the size of already successful contracts so don't introduce it because people are churning or something like that um introduce it because it's going to make your best customers more successful the when you you put your software Revenue at risk when you start using services that are low price that aren't getting them the value um like you software Founders will introduce it in order to um try to save accounts yeah but then they're not charging enough because those accounts are they're unhappy they're probably your smallest accounts that sort of stuff and so you actually just end up like building yourself into a hole as opposed to making your more successful ones even more successful and so what this means is you don't even offer the services to you don't offer it to everyone you only offer it to the ones that you know are already successful that already like you and that want you to take them to the next level that's so they basically have to qualify for it yeah that's really interesting so you're saying that like implementation obviously separate conversation right you might need to do some services in order to get somebody to their value point in the software but you're saying all of the like parallel Revenue stream type services that in your opinion this the user has to be nailing it on the software they have to be a happy customer that has certain qualifiers and at that point you offer it as like a boutique higher priced offering not like a budget thing to go save money on your Facebook you got it and I think the difference is and the difference to watch for when people are asking you for it is it's uh what else can you do for me question not a hey can you actually do this other thing for me like you have this graphic design software but I just want you to do it for me can you just do that right that's very different from like the yeah we love your software but you know we can't hire like developers fast enough and so like can we can you just have a designer like come in and you know and build these like assets out for us like that that sort of thing it's a it's an accelerent not a like completely different business so it should always be tied back to the software Revenue to the thing that you're exactly exactly that makes sense I love it um man I think that's a great place to leave it there is a I'm picturing myself listening to this podcast I'd probably have five pages of notes right now there were some there's some really great like Nuance tips that you dropped man and uh I just appreciate it man I feel like we got like a master class on agency operations and pricing and the whole nine yards here in uh in 90 minutes so John man thanks so much where do uh where do people go to find more John yeah thanks for having me uh so my company website is editor ninja.com um and then man best place to find me I used to say Twitter which apparently goes by a
