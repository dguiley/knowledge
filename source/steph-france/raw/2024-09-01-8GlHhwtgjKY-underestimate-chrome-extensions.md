# Underestimate Chrome Extensions

Published: 2024-09-01

a few weeks ago I did some research on Chrome extensions and I came across this Insight if you look at the um total number of users for Chrome extension for Google Chrome basically and the total number of apps available on the Chrome Store and you compare it to IOS and Android you come up to this incredible number there is probably like 15 times less competition for Chrome extensions than for any other kind of app for the same amount of users if it's not even more because there are so many people uh using Google Chrome so from that Insight I started I I started doing um falling in the rabbit hole and then it led me to a lot of market research um dinging and digging and then I decided to build my own Chrome extension to actually understand how it is done and how hard it is to um create a Chrome extension I I published it on the Chrome Store is available and I'm going to show show it to you uh in this video uh also I dug very hard on every POS possible example of Chrome extension I could find um and I classified them by kind of um business models as well as different monetization um type of extensions and I tried to find some Frameworks and to understand how how can we come up with Chrome extension business ideas and also I'm going to talk about what's the difference between a SAS and a Chrome extension is there a difference actually um yeah and then finally I'm going to show you how you can create a Chrome extension yourself how I did it myself I'm not going to do the complete tutorial but I will show you the process I went through so you can reproduce it it's actually pretty simple um so yeah I'm going to show that in this video and uh in the end we are going to look at how we can Market a Chrome extension uh once we have built it the idea here is just to give you an overview of everything I told you about and if you want me to go um further in each of these topics then just let me know in the comments and I could make um another video specifically on a on a part of this one also uh as usual you will have access to this figma file with a lot of links you can click on everything here links to the the right extension um yeah I'm going to show you that um along the way okay so we had a look at this incredible Insight but then the question is okay so why why is that there are actually some um kind of answers and the first one is that it's not like it's a little bit different than ABS because people are not used to pay for a plug-in so this is harder to sell although people that are using Chrome are also has have problem if you can solve a problem within Chrome at some point they would like to pay for it so there is a little bit of a paradox here between uh most of there is there are not that many developers going into this Market because it is seen as a market that is hard as opposite as uh um the normal app market but if we dig further if we look at the different kind of apps that are succeeding that are having a lot of success that I'm going to show you here then it it works it actually works like there are really good businesses on the Chrome stores Chrome Store that are built around an app um I am going to to let you look at deeply deeper um on the the market research I have done here um what I wanted to show you on Market Research is what uh is happening when you look at what are people looking at on Google regarding Chrome extensions that is actually really interesting because um this is data that I extracted from a random toolet I use for that uh every every uh search query that is related to Chrome extension for so that's what people know about right they are always like the market of what are people searching for so they know that they could find an app for that and apps that people don't know about so they wouldn't search about it so it doesn't mean that what I'm showing to you right now is the only U market for chome extension right but so if we look at that so we have a lot of General um um kind of Search terms that are not really helpful and we can see the the different volume for each of them uh what is a little bit more interesting here is to look at the cost per click because a high cost per click means that there are people somewhere willing to pay a lot for advertising on this kind of search queries uh meaning there is a big business behind it so the idea is instead of looking at the whole list and trying to find anything that's interesting let's take shortcut and just um filter it simply by um we want sorry greater than or equal to five so five um euro dollar whatever um per click that's what people are willing to pay to advertise to this kind of search 10 and here we can find let's have a look um together so honey I guess you know this one this is one of the first one that comes to mind when we think of Chrome extensions full screen for Chrome for Chrome sorry uh that is the screenshot kind of extension it works really well and there are like big businesses around it like the big ones are on literally making millions um SES Force Chrome extension for SES Force Chrome extension for developers and data Savers saver coupon um Google Chrome extension jungle Scout that's also very good extension um download helper for free Salesforce again ring centrol that is um a kind of um old company that is doing um sales call and they are now using AI for sales go so that's also an interesting market and timer so this one it's actually really weird how they can make money with the timer but apparently there is a way to do that um Google analytic interesting um yeah so I'm not going to do the the complete list again it's an overview and I don't want the video to be like two hours but it's just to give you uh an idea you have access to that um from the figma file that you can get to you just have to click here here you can just have a look for yourself and dig into it and and find some some keyword that would be interesting for you only if you want to know about it right but I guess if you are watching this video Until already you are you interested in the topic so you can dig further directly into it uh just please before making any changes uh because you you can't actually make any change uh simply let's put it back here and just click file and make a P for yourself so you can now use it okay what about the the market in general I found this article that you can check here from on lingin that is not a complete one it's a report that would cost like thousands of dollars but basically it says that the Chrome extension Market is going to grow in the next years that is also one of the triggers of my research because I could see that there are some um uh inside some clues that says that this is an interesting not industry but a field to be in like and learning how it works what works um so yeah you can check out this article uh here I've made some quick research on perplexity just to find out what is the market what is the internet saying actually and there are not a lot of um good content on Chrome extensions I found some but not a lot so what are the gross perspective for the Chrome extension Market Chrome dominant market shares uh creates a massive potential audience for extension with over three billion user the reach for well Des extension is substantial okay business opportunity low development cost um completely I mean I was able to create one um High retention that is totally true because with a Chrome extension you are literally part of someone work through you are appearing on the screen all the time it's not that they have to think about it that they just see it and if you manage it correctly then you can even have an extension that pops up every time they can use it so it's really like you can be part of the routine of the workflow of someone and then the the churn is very low uh and then you can go extremely Niche and we are going to see that in the examples by taking that some something that already exists and applying to very specific uh Niche yeah anyway that's a bit B sorry for that uh challenges um that is related also to what I said before why why is there this discrepancy between um Android iOS and Chrome extensions obviously there is no smartphone so this one um user expectation many user uh users expect Chrome extension to be free which can make monetization sense ing so we are going to look at how we can walk around that competition obviously I mean give me one field in this world where there is no competition no nowadays so that's not the progam competition is everywhere privacy concern um yeah that's true because some Chrome extension are are are really bad in privacy and Google is working against that basically what are the most profitable niches for chome extension I wouldn't really rely on that but this is what the internet says productivity tools e-commerce and shopping web development and design digital marketing um social media that's extremely vag data analysis yep web scrapping totally browser customization yes and Business Solution we have seen it with a Salesforce for example um because yeah one of the the main approach is to say okay where are people spending time um Salesforce there are not a lot but enough people that have a lot of money that spend time on sell force it could be any big platform uh YouTube um I don't know upwork Fiverr any big platform where people are spending time what how can I make their life easier basically how can I make them save time so they can make money or win something and that's where Chrome extension um exists basically okay Mark marketing uh Market Trend and nothing extreme insightful here but is just general Trends here you can see um if you use um keyword everywhere if you're looking for business ideas and you are not using keyword everywhere that's CR extension uh that I pay for you know that's a business already that is very good that tells you um the the research on Google the numbers everywhere you are and it also gives you some related and tring keyword so you can have a look at that same thing that is also if you type Chrome extension for that is the normal Google and that is what uh keywords everywhere tells you so you can also have a look at this one all right so let me just okay yeah I remember it's been it's been a while I I've done this um this complete figma file took me U days and and in between I had a lot of things going on so I I need to go back into it okay so monetize uh Chrome extension with payment very interesting one those two so that is one of the the only article I found that talk about specific revenues for a Chrome extension so I didn't use them all as example in my figma file because you can have them here so you have gmas which is called email extension directly connected to gmail which is pretty cool uh closet tool I'm going to show you it later on this one I didn't look further but it's um for developer I think gol page and that's what I told you about it's a screenshot extension spider um web scrumper I didn't remember um yeah you can go just go and check them all um they are not they are small ones but it always gives um very interesting inside and this one for me is very interesting because this is actually what the article I showed you before is an article from this business and this business is all about creating a payment system for Chrome extension so when you have a Chrome extension how do you monetize actually good question uh Google has a system if you declare yourself as a Trader I didn't test it out so I can say you can use tripe at some point but apparently there are some interest to use this kind of service and for a small website like that that it doesn't seem to really Market themselves very hard um so they have 67,000 visitor unique visitor per month I thought that that's interesting uh you know even that is a is kind of a a business idea sorry for them I'm not saying that you should do that but that's a very good Insight uh here are some related good podcast um so that's a a snip actually if you don't know snip snip D it's a podcast tool that I use so I can have like those short uh pieces of um of podcasts so you can check check it out and obviously like the very good podcasts from Greg Eisenberg and then there is this one from my first me that talks about Chrome extension uh and here it's basically the summary of uh what they say here and there is a report um from trend. VC also very very good uh so any of them I definitely recommend you check them out and you can check the report just by clicking right away here uh okay so now my Chrome extension so what did I do let's have a look at it here it is oh really actually yeah I just uh re reordered my my Chrome extension okay so you can see 43 users that's amazing uh I have my small video here I put some screenshot and the most important is what does it do I just needed an idea simple it was a learning project and I wanted to understand how I can build that although even though I don't know how to code so take the example I just pull up a random redit post that could potentially talk about um a problem how do you come up to read post I'm just going to show you that sorry it's just a parenes I know I'm I'm everywhere now I'm showing you what my app does right we are not doing research on Reddit but I just want to uh to show you how you can do that so you go on any um interesting subreddits and you class you sort them up by top and you look at this month or this year H so they are all posts that have a lot of comments that's what we want we want a lot of commments and then you will find one that talk about put um problem so I I picked this one my experance with a walk so far anyway um and here once you are here you can simply click on the extension pick an open AI model I like to use this one and find gold mines what it does right now it is directly sending um the content of the text plus a prompt to open Ai and put it back right away here so it's not that complicated but with this simple thing you can do a lot of thing right when you have a Chrome extension it can look at what the user is looking at and from that you can take some part uh use different system you can send them to make.com if you want to pass them and do whatever you want uh or directly send them through an API and and yeah use AI to to come up with some interesting Insight so for example here my prompt says that uh it should isolate the prr then um come up with user statement and then come up with potential business ideas on top of that I also created this um API key so don't worry I I just uh remove this this API key after the the video but yeah so I created this option page uh I've created like the login page um all those links and all of that without knowing how to code so I'm going to show you how I did that afterward and I'm also going to show you a little bit later what are the result like how many how do people find this extension all right let me drain quickly and now let's go for the the cool stuff those Chrome extension example that uh that are working really well one that I really really like is um this Chrome extension that is just just actually it's a Amazon Amazon price tracker actually does a lot of things if you go a little bit deeper but it's not like I mean the website is not crazy uh and you can if you dig a little bit you would see that it basically helps um Amazon sellers I I guess most of them to manage um to save time to have more informations um little bit bit like jungle Scout right but the pricing is not that high on this one and so I put it here yeah the pricing is subscription business model subscription is1 19 and they have 4 million users right you can see it here 4 million users so if we take something extremely conservative and we say that 0.2% of those 4 millions are paid users means they have 8,000 users it means that they're making 150k per month that is conservative it could be way more and in the end it's it's quite a simple software I mean I could not build that myself but for Dev um I think it's pretty simple okay next one this one is probably my favorite one brisk teaching it's it's just a pure example of um nading down Niche problem and using Ai and Chrome extension to uh to solve that sorry was not on the right one so this is this one okay risk teaching it's a Chrome extension that already has 400,000 users that is made for teachers and that creates um a complete environment for them so they can use AI to save um incredible amount of time I se incredible not that I used it but I looked at the the the reviews and people really love it and this is not and that's what I showed you here this is not a a self um a solo proner obviously that is um Venture founded um Chrome extension but that's also what's interesting that it is a business from the Silicon Valley that's you know they put a lot of money into a Chrome extension because this is only what it is it's just a Chrome extension let me look at the yeah this one so they have a website yeah when you're on the website that's the only thing they have um but the monetization behind it makes it like it's sorry I'm if I'm a little bit confused here but you know we at the beginning I said Chrome extensions are there there is less competition why because people think that plugin shouldn't be um should be free right but that is a plugin but is advertised it's marketed as an actual business it solve a real problem for teachers and they love it and it just used AI to solve their program so they can charge for it and they are even um making ads to sell their product so they I I guess they're in a growing phase right now but they are making those cool ads that you you can check out that is um yeah a real business uh and you can use this approach basically uh to reproduce it for any kind of niches like it's basically using Ai and creating an environment on Chrome for a specific kind of use case I don't know doctors or or um moment Pop Shop I don't know if you say that moment Pop Shop there um yeah anyway uh so that one I definitely encourage you to check it out and to dig a little bit further because it's a very cool example here you have this kind of uh I would I'm not sure if it's solo prona but it seems to me that it's not as a big company as this one although they are doing kind of the same thing they're addressing student teachers um enable enabling Educators um yeah so that's kind of a lowering lower version of brisk but it also has 60,000 users so it means that uh it is gathering a lot of the the market shares okay let's go down to the next one so the next one is recruit bols I found this one while I was looking at uh Salesforce related um Chrome extensions that are making money let me open it here so there are only 2,000 users but obviously you get it that um when you are in this kind of niches it's B2B um so the the amount of user is obviously completely different if I open the website um [Music] pricing so they have um monthly plan and I guess that for big companies then they are charging a lot more that's also a very good example of a simple Chrome extension probably not a simple but that um go very narrow on a specific program for specific uh B2B Niche which is recruiting uh here we have H those two are are funny you can check them out on your own because those are probably not the ones that make the most money but they are very big um in users and maybe not this one but they're working with donations they are simply made by um single developer that is just like um asking for people to support the app and apparently they're working since a long time so I would say that generates a um a living for the person is building it so here it's a very it's not interesting approach on how to use Chrome extensions uh and this is to sell services so this one for example was made by um this person which is a consultant that has the different services and he has several extensions like that that have a decent amount of users that are linked to his website so um on one hand is delivering um um some kind of services for free showing expertise and when people want to know more then um they come and see him also when you have a Chrome extension you can generate emails that's what I did here with mine uh if I wasn't logged then I have an email um opin form but it means that you can use the email that you generate uh with your Chrome extension that is free to sell any kind of services basically the the Chrome extension could live as a lead magnet um the only difference is that it's a magnet that could live on its own and be found by thousands and thousands of people so I thought this one was worth showing because it's a it's another approach on how to use Chrome the Chrome extensions um here it's um it's one feature of focused and again we talked about it uh automated Google analytic annotations and I didn't dig into exactly what it does I never needed that but apparently a lot of people are finding it useful and it is mon monthly uh payment um monetization system so that's pretty basic they just from the platform um added one feature and charge for that okay here we are we have something a little bit different which is a Chrome extension that is just a part of um broader sze business this means the business is not the Chrome extension but it couldn't work without it I don't know if you follow here let me open it it's a l scrap scraper um like there are plenty of them on the internet but it can only work with the Chrome extension if you go how to use then I'm not going to read everything but you can see that it works with these Chrome extensions what does it means for them is that on in addition of doing a normal Market in for um their business like every other s would do then they also benefit from the SEO of the Chrome web of the Chrome web store so they can like for example write blogs uh on on Google to be found found on Google and generate traffic like that go on social media and do ads and whatever but they also generating the free traffic that is coming from the CHR the Chrome Store that's a that's a another interesting example I tried to there are plenty of them right and I will show you how you can find them uh but I wanted to find some that are different to one another because they all have such um a specificity okay this one is another big Platform One feature uh with subscription and the cool thing is that you can find the story on Indie ha girl so I just let you check that out but the founder explains how they um how they come across the idea what what they were struggling with and why they created this app but that's the same Principle as for example the um sorry which was it uh one feature subscription for Google analytics same same concept but for Amazon one feature another one here that is very well documented uh is super power chat GPT so it obious to take advantage of the huge AI hype and it was featured in the very good starter story uh YouTube channel so you can check the video out here uh and the founder explains basically how he is generating money and what I thought is really cool is that he actually has U not a paid newsletter maybe that's a little bit confusing uh I would just write newsletter but is generating he has a paid and a pro free and a paid plan for this extension so some features are under a pay wall behind a pay wall but all the people that are uh in the free plan um they are giving him their email address and with that he is simply writing a newslet simply quote unquote he's writing a good newsletter delivering value and he finds sponsors that want to advertise on this newsletter so it has two different monetization for just a Chrome extensions there is nothing more than a Chrome extension that improve CH GPT um yeah so that's another particularity the newsletter okay another one that was on the article I showed you here the eight Chrome extensions um so on that you probably remember bushar which I didn't know is actually a marketplace where you can sell stuff um I guess a lot of people are selling stuff on it uh it basically follows the same Principle as this one takes a Marketplace somewhere where people are doing things spending time and it add different functionalities uh to make them save time and make more money so it can charge for that and I don't remember how much this one makes let's have a look quickly it's this one um closet tools 42k per month and that article is quite old and I think uh does it say how many users they have but I really think that they got a lot more users uh since the article was published so you can check it out further on your own um but is also um it's not a unique because it's the same as the Amazon I showed you before but this framework is really cool just find a Marketplace and create something that makes users life better okay another specific one this is a screenshot tool Chrome extension okay nothing really fancy here what's fancy here though is the monetization if you want to purchase it then it's a lifetime deal and that's that's pretty good because you really there there is no um I guess there is nothing that um creates cost on the developer side it's just a piece of code that you can sell on onetime fee and since it's hard to convince people to pay for a plug-in at least if they pay once and not and don't had add another subscription um then it could be easier so one feature focused and just lifetime deal okay the two last ones they are just here because they are cool but we have seen the kind of um framework and mon monetization method already push to Kindle it's it's like readwise that's another uh Chrome EX function that you can see here that I'm paying for if you don't know readwise um I should have showed it already but that is basically a a place where you can um uh export all your highlights um uh you can save articles you can uh save newsletters you can uh connect with all the the tools where you want to store the different highlights and anyway it's a very good Chrome extension and I am paying for me it's a no-brainer I think it's 8 per month and basically they're doing a similar thing but for Kindle row it's like you on on on the internet and you find a good article then you use the Chrome extension and you find it on your Kindle and they just charge for a very small fee but they have a fair amount of users and I think you have to pay yeah if you want to use it properly you have to pay so they'll probably U making a decent living with this Chrome extension another one uh email extractor again 300,000 users extremely simple basically uh scraps the page you are in and find out the potential emails in there there are few um paid features um with a subscription plan again very simple um principle that just email extractor and not fancy tool but that work and as a lot of users all right okay now let's have a look at how to find a Chrome extensions ideas even though we talked about it already uh and after that we are going to look at how we create one and how we Market one um first of all thinking Frameworks um I just wrote a few of them uh to you so now you know them from the list we have seen already but you can have like bri brisk forx um you know the teacher AI environment for Teacher then briis for is a framework super power CH GPT so you can have like super power forx make people life easier on certain platform scrapping for X like uh eain extractor or whatever or even my one the the Reddit uh Chrome extension missing feature for X so it's one feature big platform uh closet 4X Marketplace making their life U easier and also think of you can have like a very an extension that that live lives on its own if it is something that people already look for so you don't have a lot of marketing to do if the extension that you build would fit to something people will look for already so you kind of create a an alternative of something that is already existing or you make something better or whatever in this case you can have an Chrome extension only if you go to something that people are not already looking for then it's it's basically creating a s and I told you before we were talking about we will be uh talking about what's the difference between software as service and Chrome extension there is none um a Chrome extension is a piece of code is a software and when you solve someone's problem then you are basically um solving a it's a service so Chrome extension is a SAS business um the only difference is that you would call it a Chrome extension if it's only um living on its own because people find it on the on the Chrome Store on their own and you would call it a size with a Chrome extension if if you need to Market it on uh on the side if you need to do like the same marketing as any potential other size business so just think of what you want to build and you have a few framework to start with uh now if we dig a little bit um further into existing market so that's what I was talking about if you take the list I gave you and you go okay let's take this one for example people are paying a lots apparently that there is a market developers are very likely to look for forr extensions uh extension so you take this one and then you look at the result right you just copy and past here on the Chrome Store and you want to um click on established Publishers why it's because you will find only the ones that have a website that is connected and you want to limit um the amount of um rating to three and up and from there you will see all the extensions that have been built by uh independent developers you can see how many uh rating they have so you guess how successful they are and if you go down and you find some bad rating but a lot of U users and there is always something to do here it means that there are they are already on a market where people are looking for they have a lot of users but people are still downloading it even though the service is not perfect so that's a very good way to look for uh different um ideas for existing Market another thing you can check out is if the Chrome extension is um declare itself as um monetizing if you look at a Chrome extension page and you go down here when they have that it means that they went through the process to say I'm going to make money with this Chrome extension the other way around is also possible some Chrome extension won't have that but they would make money so that's a bit tricky but that is also a good sign to know uh what you're looking at basically okay now another approach which is for new markets new techs Tech how can you come up with an idea that could do a good Chrome extension so first of all but that is not related only to Chrome extensions is for any kind of business you look at the macro Trends first and here are a few places where you can hang out and and see what works so here you have let me close those window those tabs here uh here you have the [Music] um YC combinator which has a startup directory and they are constantly adding a new startup that they are backing which means they are smart guys if they are backing the startup in a certain field there is something to do here so it's not to copy anything or whatever it's just to look at what they are backing so you know you can go in the same direction and try to solve a problem there uh you have different website that you probably know like exploding PS um even with the free plan you can find interesting trends that just give you a an overall um idea of a micr trend I would rather always look at trends that have a lot of volume and where the basically I wouldn't look for something like that um because the there is probably a catalyst for this TR here and when it's like that there is a lot of chances like this very soon so I would always look at trends that look look like that with more volume than this one on the screen how you do you know if there is more volume okay first it can be written here you can double check on Google Trend and also and that is valid for any kind of trend tool when you see a curve that's like that it means that there the the changes are visible which means there are not a lot of volume you want something that is quite stable and that grows over the last two three years and then it has a very solid chance that it stays like that this one AI necklace very good example this one was a huge fail I don't know if you follow the the story but I think if you look at it now it just it will go my guess is it's going to go down very very fast uh here you have you have um a list of the fastest growing companies for the last year um and it won't be really helpful but I had a look at it recently and solar companies are crushing it uh here I think it's for the European one yeah it's European fastest growing companies so you have all the datas and you can see what is actually working but that's a is a macro Trend right um so yeah you can start here find some um Rabbit Hole to dig in here you have another list which I really like like is the marketplace 100 which gives you the 100 biggest Marketplace ever so first of all those are all existing Marketplace you can find one and build uh a Chrome extension to make people life easier on this Marketplace but also it gives you an idea of what is working since they are the biggest in the world and then you can go on the next phase which is um go down the rabbit hole how do you do that uh honestly since I know jiga brain that's probably my my go-to now is it was just my my last test before I I did the the the example with my app it's just like what our program uh people are facing on X and it would go through Reddit and come up with a summary of what are people talking about and give you all the post and all the different subreddits you can go through and find what are people struggling with so here we go from microtran and we go a little bit further then you can look at this tool which I showed in another video already which will uh which would help you to find out what are uh the potential bubble or topics that are connected to the one you have found so for example if I'm on upwork then I can look at it means that when people are subscribed to upw work they are also very likely to be uh on these other subreddits right just be careful uh even though it's updated here because it scrubed uh the um it I don't know how it works but basically that is up to date but it has been done on a um a sample of data that is um that is outdated but it redit has made it so hard for developers to create tools so it has been done sample of data and now the connection exists right it's just for you to id8 but it's not 100% accurate also I absolutely need to uh give a shout out to the to the dev of this tool which I didn't do last time uh and I talked with him in between so let me uh pull out his Twitter profile all right is here Andre kha um thank you very much very good app and he also has another app that I'm going toh show you in the further video uh also about Reddit um very cool Dev that is doing uh visualization tools okay another kind of way which could be um related or not you can also start there is to find a common problem and build in public um so you could arrive to um certain subredit and a certain post by having followed this approach uh you can use myicr extension to come up with ideas to solve their problem if you don't want to read everything but is building public will me which means you you've spot a community where there is an actual problem people are looking for solution to and you can start uh asking questions you can I have a video about um how to use quizzes uh I call that um quick and dirty quizzes to ask them a lot of questions to to know what you could build for as a solution and and from there if you decide to go for it then you basically document your journey in the Community you found and all the communities around that talk about this specific program so when you launch finally your product then people know you and you have your first users that start uh Kickstart the growth of your app okay finally for the how to find ideas um two things I wanted to show you here it's actually it's a little bit we okay uh so that's basically a video that our Advance explain um shows a model an AI model that allows to create change Clauses on people just mindblowing extremely robust and flexible even works on nonre okay I'm not going to show you more of that why I'm showing you that is because something like that it's not very complicated even for someone that is not a developer it's not really complicated to understand how it works uh most of the models like that they're working on uh sorry replicate um there are AI model that you can access with an API which means you can use no code tools or simple API calls to get an input and generate an output and the one I just showed you here is exactly that I didn't dig further but I guess it is uh so if you take that example then you can imagine creating Chrome extension for whatever use you want uh using this um Tech so that's another approach I wanted to show you it's like here we are looking at uh what are people looking for creating better Solutions here we are looking at what is growing right now getting deeper and spot a program and find and create solution and there is another approach which is a little bit more tricky is find the Cool Tech that wasn't existing before and turn it into a solution but you need to be careful not to create solution that nobody wants uh just to finish up here um yeah if you want to look at this website very cool very simple to use you have all the open source models that you can run here and you can use m.com as I said to just get input outputs so definitely recommend checking it out and lastly to find extensions I um I was in touch with the um the person writing this newsletter which is really cool it's Chrome extension ideas so if you want Chrome extension ideas just go here you have the archive uh and it's still see the last one was two days ago um yeah he doing a really great jobs job at um coming up with with cool ideas so you can even start here if you don't like my approaches all right right uh now let's look at the next one which is how do we create a Chrome extensions and a chrome I I don't know why I'm saying an S at the end I'm I'm too French I'm sorry put s when there isn't and I forgot them what there as anyway uh okay so you have different ways no code I didn't test it uh code with the AI That's what I did and if you use code with AI you can buy template and you you can start from existing this one is a little bit tricky it's a little bit like stealing what is already existing so I'm going to show you this one too no code uh let's open them let's close everything here and open them all pretty straightforward uh I mean the value proposition is um simple as I said I didn't use it um because I didn't even think there was a product I found it after I built my my app but I guess if you don't want to deal with code I would start here uh here you have another one which is quite similar actually and the last one is this one is funny because it's so if you know bubble.io it's a no code tool um which you can use to create any kind of SAS but this this tool is built with another nood tool which is uh I think it's built with software you can see the the icon here U and helps you to build an app using a bubble.io so I I have no idea what they're doing but probably let's have a look at the traffic I don't know if they uh if it says 700 um it's probably probably three times that um so it's it's fair enough so yeah those are solutions I wanted to put them here so if you want to go no code then you have an idea now let's have a look at what I did uh to create my extension that was the first try that was my first attempt I generated that and I was extremely proud of myself and that's how it looks now and here is the all that there is all the things that are in my extension all the files so three icons and like five pieces small pieces of code uh let's have a look at how I started because I think that's uh the interesting thing here okay so that's the end of the conversation and I'm going to so it's Cloud um 3.5 uh and at some point I had to switch to GPT I will tell you why but you know look on the right that's that's the conversation so you can see that's very long conversation and I didn't know it would be that long so I'm not saying it's easy I'm saying you can just go ahead and and figure it out um along the way um because it's just possible when you have no knowledge in code um so yeah that's the very first thing I do I would like to help you uh you to help me to create a Google Chrome app the concept is very simple it allows the user to generate business ideas based on the content of the current page using AI imagine you are on Reddit you click the app U there is a short menu asking if you want to scrub and analyze you click yes the result is a list of two to eight business ideas uh it needs to have a feature for the user to connect their open AI API key because I didn't want to the user to use mine uh it needs to scrap the data then send it to uh the API and send it back to the app so you can see that it's not even what I've built here but I started with a simple idea and I refined it along the way so it just tells me okay um that's what you want to create let's break it let's break it down uh here are the files that you are going to create so basically here yeah let me show you a little bit more detail on how I did it please if you're developer don't be mad at me because uh I'm probably not using the right tools but at least it it works for me so here I have a simple file on my desktop right uh and then here are all the code files so the tool I use is uh notepad++ very easy for me to use and I have all this um different files on one single page and the colors are pretty easy so basically what uh the AI and whatever you do it with cl or chpt it's the same uh in the end it will tell you to create a manifest. Jon Json so you will just go here and uh copy your uh your code so if I wanted to do it again uh here I would open the Manifest then I would copy sorry copy content then I would past it here then contrl S I save so I ask me what do you want to do with it and then I call it manifest do Json save yeah I don't want to replace it but once you have done that then done you have your manifest and it's chasen uh next one and so on and so forth and so you just apply the um the instruction and uh so I said create the files for me to save because I didn't want I didn't know exactly how it worked okay um it loaded successfully so he explained me how I can uh import it on the app I'm not going to show you that's very easy uh you just load the package um and then I continue uh it loaded successfully I open the r page for test clicked the app it asked me to enter my apiq which I did then when I click generate business idea this happens and I show a screenshot I'm like okay error then he said okay thank you for providing the screenshot uh it seems you have successfully ER and we go again and again okay look uh I'm not a Dev although I'm familiar with API please explain to me how the code uh you created Works what are the different part for for and where is the user whatever what I'm saying here is hey I'm not Dev please tell me everything you do and make it very simple for me to uh understand what you do and when you tell me to do something explained really well because I don't know how to go so I had to say that several time times during the conversation because sometime it just assumes that I know things and then I just continue um one thing I found out that was really uh interesting is if I go back to reddits uh I didn't even have to slip this whatever if I click here and then I would run run it so I'm not on on the right page so it will have an error oh no not even uh to debug it so when I have a problem at the beginning I was just showing a screenshot now what I found out it's really cool I just open I click inspect just to the com go to the console open everything I can and I just take screenshots of the whole thing and then I make some uh I explain okay I clicked here and this happened and now it has the the action that that happened or I don't know if yeah so I take the screenshot and and then I give that to the AI and then you can see the app and what happened in the console and it's very easy actually to debug every time it tells you to do something you do it you test doesn't work give the console logs and the knows directly why uh there is a program and and move on to the next um iteration so you have it uh I told you I changed to chat GPT why because CLA uh has so many limitation I was so mad uh at some point I couldn't make enough prompts um and also I figured that when the when it was getting extremely long the the context window is still big enough so it remembered without any program but it was going extremely slow because there was so many so much data so I needed to start back and to start back I just opened uh a chpt file and I gave it all my um um files from the app and then he right away he knew what was the the app about so yeah so that's it that is the um how do you uh do abs when you don't know anything about coding uh it works I did it I published it Google approved my um my app so it's I I guess it's fine okay now you can also buy templates uh and if you open this website which is code Canyon I think you can see that you have a bunch of Chrome extension template that you can start work working from so basically I would uh buy this one and give it to an AI and say okay that's the the original file and I would like to um to tweak first of all I would like to change the color whatever and I would like to change this function and functionality and you know just have it as a starting point uh you can also use uh replat I don't know if I pronounced it properly never used this website but I'm following along and I know that you can hire people to help you to build small pieces of code so obviously you can find someone to help you to build a Chrome extension here and finally there is this uh Chrome extension that steals um all Chrome extensions code and I did it and it works which means you can the the code Chrome extension code is available on the internet you can download it you just just download this extension and you go ahead and you just follow the instruction and you will have the exact same thing as that if you do it with my extension then you will end up with exactly those fights the one that I wrote so there is nothing secret you can basically publish it again but I mean obviously Google will find out but what you can do is to um download an extension simple extension that you like and then do the exact same thing as if you have both a template you change a feature you change the branding you you just use it as the base for your work I know it's not cool but it exists and it's a load by Google so why not okay how do we Market a Chrome extension how do we find users the first thing I I wanted to do is just to ask the internet you know that's my goto I ask the internet and then I figure it out uh when I ask the internet you know now how I work like you have perplexity for now that works really well that will give you ideas from blog post and you have the same thing with J brain that gives you idea from read it so you can read them all and there is nothing extremely fancy uh optimized from Chrome web store listing that's basically Chrome Store SEO L Lage online Channel yeah sure social media PID advertising yes build emerence yeah we know we all should build emergence collaborate and network um and optimize for search um you can optimize for search both for normal Google search and also for CH Chrome web store and on Reddit they say run paid uh ads to reach white audence promote extension on relevant form and social media platform that's what I said with building public Pinterest yeah okay uh launch on product hunt obviously I mean if you have a especially I would say uh if you are in the case of doing something for an existing Market I mean you can do it but you can also bet everything on the SEO side uh if you are in this case which means you are creating something new that people are not looking for already then I would definitely uh launch on product hunt engage with communities such as India cars and dave. I don't know this one yes why not and create a website and marketing campaign that's extremely vague and basic so now that was just what the internet says uh how to go to market from my perspective um there are some thing that are the same um buil in public with different different communities social media and newsletter that is the that's quite basic right it's it works for every kind of business basically if you uh give value um generate create Authority gather people on newsletter where you continue giving value and then you push them to your s business or Chrome extension okay those one are extremely B basic YouTube channel um completely uh underrated um I guess that's uh any kind of Chrome extension could find uh people with a YouTube channel that is dedicated to it um talking about specific problem so I think that for whatever idea I would use I I would find to build an extension then I would probably have a dedicated YouTube channel where I would do like videos like this one where I just explain the program how to find um how to solve a program or whatever is valuable for the specific kind of users I am targeting to without fun editing just U you want qualified users um looking for SEO titles like you know for search optimized for search uh not for clickbait or generating a lot of traffic you just want the qualified user that wants to uh use your app ads even if it's Chrome extension again it's a sze business uh if you have a monetization behind it yes you can use ads although you need um it's a lot of work to make it work um so but but it work if you are comfortable with ad that work called email uh call emails I mean if you look at all these different um apps they are mostly addressed to business right so uh here it's for Amazon business owners here it's for teachers they are not businesses but you can use University by the way they also have a plan for University so you can reach them uh out VI email um same thing here here for businesses um as soon as you are creating an extension that is addressing businesses then C email is the best way to go because it's it's just you can scrap a bunch of emails and create targeted email campaign uh you are just especially if you have a free plan you are just giving a heads up to people you're not trying to Hard Sell you're just saying hey I'm building this Chrome extension uh this is for people like you struggling with this program you're struggling with um just check it out it's free I'm happy to get your feedback if you have any that's it and and basically for I don't know $100 per month you can send uh hundreds of email per day and generate your first users like that and product ear uh hunt we are we agree on that how do you grow optimize optimize for rating um I think one thing I'm I'm not seeing on all my search I didn't see a lot almost none app that are trying to generate emails creating a good onboarding flow to show exactly what the app does give some example to make people actually use it uh and then ask for rating because I'm I don't know but I guess that um for an extension to be shown on the CH Chrome Store um in those categories it needs to have a very good writing and also a lot of uh rating this one is actually not that much but still so I would say that is the first thing I would fix if I wanted to grow um is to make sure that every new user has a good time uh enjoy itself using it for the first time understands everything and and then when I'm sure that they know what we're are talking about then I I would ask for rating SEO back Lings that is another topic I wasn't sure about uh how you know the Chrome extension Su again if I uh look at I don't know if this one would be a good fit yeah so here you have a app I I don't know I just put it out pulled it out like that and here you have a website so if you are optimizing this website and having a lot of um um backlinks pointing to this website since the app is registered is connected to the website I guess that the the better the SEO on this website the better the SEO on the app I I would say so it means that if you have a website that generating like a million visitor per month and you create an extension that's connected to it then the extension gets a push I have no idea if it's true it's just my guess right but I also heard and read about um backlinks for Chrome apps so it's what if you get some good website uh linking to the app directly so now you have it's not even connected to the website it's just directly to the app so it's a good signal for Google a lot of people are talking about this app so it has better chance to be featured uh on the store and also to to come up first when um people are looking for um specific things on on Google either both on Google and on the uh Chrome Store okay YouTube channel I actually talked about it it's the same here and sync Network effect uh that's harder because it's not for every kind of app but that's something I would always do is like how can I create another user from from a user H what interaction can I have um what would people that use my app want to share for example here with my um app the problem is that it shows business ideas and that's definitely want what you don't want to share it's very bad here uh but if you have a resle that people would like to share with friend then you need to make that happen right or if you have like something um that they would use in their work in their slack channel for example then I would make sure that I make it extremely easy to copy the result to the SL Channel but with a very small like it was made with this app and then you create create a kind of network effect if you want to know more about Network effect um definitely check out this website it's a little bit complicated sometime but it's a it's all about um Network okay how to monetize we have seen the different monetization U method lifetime plan pay-per viws I actually didn't see any we this the one we haven't seen uh it's always like one time or subscription but I would like to see more payper viws kind of uh you have keywords everywhere the one I showed you before was before payper use you were buying credit and I loved it but then they changed to um annual plan I I was so mad but because they're so good I had to to keep paying but I was really mad because I I think more and more users are are pissed with having thousands of subscription um paying 10 EUR here 20 EUR there we just want to pay for what we use and I would see I would see that as a very cool way to monetize the Chrome extension uh affiliate market so of deson obviously affiliate marketing any kind of affiliate marketing I had never find find one app that was apart from only uh but apart from the shopping kind of Chrome extension I didn't find any that was actually uh generating money with affiliate which is a shame I think it's possible to find out something like that I don't know it's it's too lag I'm sorry but that's just an idea in in building sponsored newsletter we talked about that already um yeah and last thing just before I recorded this video funny thing I uh received an email which is yeah it was like two hours ago or one hour ago uh it's a guy from Fiverr that asked me to um to to hire him to optimize the SEO for the Chrome extension so I guess it's it's a thing you know like there is really something to think through and um and optimize your extension for Su uh talking about that I wanted to show you as well and that will be the last thing the uh developer dashboard because that was a little bit of a pain to upload it to Google for it to be live you know there is a big difference between creating the app and then it works only on your side and making it live for everybody body else uh so you have to follow a bunch of um rules and and complete like a lot of um information but it's it's it's really feasible really there is nothing incredible you just have to go through all the menus uh here and complete everything and and it works it took me they say it's a it's a few weeks actually I think in four days or five days uh it was agreed and validated and was the the store and here is is the um so I have a bunch of users so that's not the one I wanted to show you I want to show you the Impressions so as you can see here it's the I posted twice I posted on the Discord server um that you can join there is the link in the description and I posted on YouTube Community just to to have a few feedback so that's that's the the the frost us users came like that but then what I I didn't want to to to push on it I just wanted few people to try it uh but what I wanted to see is is the extension showing up on the Chrome Store and it does because look we are on the 29 and so you have two one or two days and here you can see yesterday it was 21 Impressions and the day before 23 22 it means that my very very simple app coded with AI is showing up on the Chrome Store without any optimization and on the topic that is not even a very searchable topic I mean uh it's called basically thing Reddit hidden gold mines um turn any Reddit post into a great business business idea I checked there are not a lot of people looking for CH up for business ideas and still every time someone looks for R kind of thing it shows up so it means that if you create a good product that is optimized for search then it's very likely to grow um simply via SEO which is not the case with any other uh kind of sus business so that's one more reason to create a Chrome extension right okay cool so we went through everything and again it was a long video and I didn't want it to I mean it's very hard you know because those research can take very long if you I I have this ability to go down very down in each Rabbit Hole so it it can take me months if I never stop decided to stop and to put something together that is interesting enough so you can have a good idea of if you want to go for Chrome extension or not I have nothing to win here because I'm not going to build one I was just genuinely interested in learning this market and understanding this opportunity and it was a lot of fun to create one um although I'm not um a Dev and I'm not after SAS businesses um so yeah that was just for pure information I hope you found it useful um let me know in the comments if there is one topic you would like me to um talk about more if a lot of people liking the comment then why not I could make a video about it if you have any question same thing in the comments and I um if you follow Channel you know that I'm reading and answering every single comment so don't hesitate let me know um if you have some I will answer it um yeah that's all I see you in the next video bye-bye
