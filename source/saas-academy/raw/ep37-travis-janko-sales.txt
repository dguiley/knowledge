[Music] all right we have an awesome episode of the podcast today I'm here with my good friend and also someone who I've worked with personally he's a partner in SAS Academy he's the CEO of GSD coach and recruiting helps people find worldclass sales Talent it's one of the best sales recruiters I've ever seen in the game Travis jenko welcome to the podcast man thanks Matt it's awesome here yeah it's awesome to have you it's awesome to have you so um I want to take get back for a minute sure I want to know one thing what's the first sale you made in your life first sale I made probably not what most people would think um actually my first sales job was selling vacuum cleaners door too vacuum cleaners door too vacuum cleaners door to door I was absolutely terrible like I mean literally I was so bad that and I was poor so I had people literally driving me around dropping me off and so I could knock on doors until I could sell something did you have to bring a vacuum yeah yeah it was a heavy one so basically my first sale after 3 weeks of completely failing um a trainer went with me halfway through literally grabbed me and like said shut up and he closed the deal so that was my first that was my first sale so what's the backstory behind that what were you saying that you shouldn't have been saying what was going on I was trying to tell them every feature and benefit that the whole whole thing had versus finding out if they even like it was I was terrible yeah but we see SAS Founders do that too right they go through every single feature in the whole thing instead of just do you have a problem I can solve let me go I can solve it damn that's fascinating you know it's funny cuz I've never worked as a salesperson I mean I've been a Founder which I think is the same thing in a lot of ways but you know I I always hear salespeople say that the the people who have done door to-door sales are a different breed of salesperson versus the people who have only done sales in the internet era is that something you agree with oh yeah it it's door to-door sales is a lot different I mean people get afraid of picking up the phone imagine like having Farmers Let Dogs Out the Door chasing you when you're trying to knock on their door and with a vacuum yeah having people like show you that they have a gun when you're at the door all those type of things yeah so totally different situation man and so what's the I don't want to leave on a cliffhanger on the on the door to door vacuum sales like how did how did that end up working out was your first 4 a into sales you closed a deal or two but like what was the trajectory so really good um after I watched the trainer I I basically just begged him like let me let me shadow you for a week and I shadowed him for a week he followed me around he taught me I figured it out um finally got a sale my on my own after about a four or five weeks and I made more money than I could imagine at that point um this was was so many years ago um I got really really good at it became the number one salesperson and 6 months later was promoted to sales manager which all sounds awesome um and I was a terrible sales manager really yes so so walk us through then what made you a good rep but a bad manager so I had a process I followed as a rep and I just rinse and repeat rinse and repeat just like in sports right it's the same thing you just keep following that process that works um as a manager though I thought all I need to do is tell everybody to do exactly what I do exactly the way that I do it uh which which doesn't work um and I nobody had taught me that you need to learn your people you need to understand their motivation um I just assume that you tell people what to do and that doesn't work really great with new salespeople all right so I have a couple of questions on this uh before I dive into them I just want to say this for the people listening that I promise you we're not going to do a podcast about vacuum sales but it's an incredible backstory um so you know who this guy is I mean Travis you were a sales director at a company that went on to get acquired for 10 figures then a sales director at a company that went on to get acquired for nine figures like you've come a long way from dragging a vacuum down the street you know throwing it at a dog um which is awesome but but man the mindset that it takes to to survive in that environment or really any any sales environment is fascinating so you know when you said that you became a sales manager and the biggest lesson that you learned was that you needed to learn your people I imagine that starts with mindset so my question is what type of mindset do you have to be try that again what type of mindset do you have to have in order to be a worldclass salesperson yeah there's there's a lot of things that go into that um I think that the biggest thing is you have to understand winning and some of the best sales people I've ever worked with have been winning athletes because they're again like I said it's rinse and repeat yeah um but you also have to understand what it is to lose and that that's okay so if you've ever seen uh somebody who is think back to high school and you have somebody that lost their first wrestling match after four years and they freaked out they didn't know what to do because they hadn't learned that sometimes you're going to lose it just happens so I think the the mindset of a salesperson is you have to think about winning you also have to be think about process but you also have to know that you're going to get more losses than wins it's just that's just what it is but how do you like keep a healthy mindset when you're getting rejected 70% of the time and and that's a good a good number for most sales reps like or 80% or 90% of the time how do you stay in the game it's a lot of self motivation hanging around the right people that are going to point you in the right direction but also knowing the big thing is if you know your data and you know your numbers and you know if I do this I'm going to get here yeah so just knowing literally at the end of the month mon if as a salesperson my goal is 10 sales if I know what I need to do to get to 10 sales then I just need to go do those things and I know that there's going to be some tough things that are going to happen along the way there's going to be wins along the way the the thing for new salese is they celebrate way too soon when they think they have a win and when they don't and then they get that loss somebody says I'm going to do it call me back next week and they chalk it up they're high fiveing everybody and then next week never happens and then they get really down on themselves so it's just just about knowing some of those things are going to happen that's interesting I've had to tell multiple salespeople over over my my time in Tech that it doesn't count until the credit card gets processed right until the money's in the bank you have not made a sale they can say whatever they want but it's not until it's in you know that's uh that's interesting I've had that conversation thousands of times I bet you have man I bet um cool so let's talk Tech for a minute now right so you were the sales director at Trulia that got acquired by Zillow for I don't know $3 billion a little bit more than that right like how did you before we talk about the acquisition which I think everyone's going to be super interested in but how did you come into that position like how did you get the job what was that like and how big was Trulia at that point so Trulia was really like when you think of startup and you hear about like the wild west startup that's what Trulia was when I started I was the 35th employee okay in the Denver office um I had never wored worked in a startup so I was in I went from vacuum cleaner sales into corporate sales I figured there was a couple steps in between vacuums and sales directory for you vacuum to Car Sales to digital marketing sales got it um on and on and then we moved to Denver I applied at Trulia um the interview process was crazy really it it today the interview process has to move fast back then nothing moved fast um so I started there like to kind of take a side note when I started um one week out of training just product training I didn't even have all the product down yet and my my director called me in and said hey um we need to have a conversation you're going to start with your team tomorrow I'm like oh cool I'm not ready but let's do it yeah and she said also they're the monkey in the middle and I said what what is that she said they only hit 35% to quota last last month so we put them in the middle of the room so everybody could see who was the team this this is like pretty scary yeah oh also they loved their manager who we just fired and two of them applied for your job and didn't get it go get them wow sounds like you were really set up to win I was not set up to win um it was it was pretty tough the first few days were really rough um you know I I would come into the room and talk to the team and here's what I would get and nothing like the the two people who would apply for my job were the ring leaders um so it took a bit um I won them over just started figuring out what their motivations were how can I help you get there um what you should know is that there was no process M nobody did everybody did everything so new business you do that upsell you do that retention you do that customer success you do that that's what this so it was you think of what how we teach process there was no process it was literally the Wild West our team was terrible nobody on the team had hit quota in 3 months and they hit 35% um so what I did is well I tried to talk with all the other leaders and all the other directors and again I was the new guy yeah um so what I did is I found the top two sales people I just looked through Salesforce I found who the top two sales people in the company were um like by far the top two salespeople and I shadowed them for two weeks early in the morning late at night anything that I could do and I figured figured out their process I figured out what they were doing then I also realized that there was a way to gain the system a bit um so you had a quota based off of new business you also had a qu a quota based off of upsell you had a quot based off of retention and they wanted you to do all three of those things um I just figured out who on the team was really good at each of those and I figured if you can just hit 300% to this thing you don't need to worry about those two things wow so you split the book essentially between your people yep and I I used the process that that I had built or that I had learned um I found the two worst people on the team who wanted to learn sat them right next to me and literally I listened to every single call and I just typed telling them what to say until we figured it out wow um I mean there was a lot more to the leadership than that sure but that was the basics um you can fast forward about 4 months after that we were 360% to quota and I almost got written up because we weren't following process so if you can think about how crazy that is yeah so how many how many different sales teams were you like how many peers did you have when I started um there were three other teams okay um and again my team when I left so we had 35 people when I left there were 600 people in the building wow literally in in the building we just kept taking over other offices um there was no room for interviews so we built 10 like little come on you were interviewing intense int it's wild oh yeah it it was pretty cool that's crazy and so okay so you took this under performing team you came in they didn't really like you just because not because of your fault because of the circumstances and your process just reading this back to make sure I understand your process was I think there's greatness somewhere in this building it's just not in my little pod but let me go find it figure out what good looks like and then you reverse engineered how to take that into your team that that was like principle number one is figure out what good looks like and pattern match against it and principle number two is that you had a group of people who were all doing three different jobs and you figured out it was probably better to let them specialize in different types of jobs so you reallocated the work um and I think the reason I want to call that out is because I think that like when I look back in my first company I didn't I didn't know any of this stuff and I didn't understand why any company on Earth would have a Setter versus a closer or an SDR versus an account executive whatever terminology you want to want to use I I didn't grasp the difference in the different components of the job and so I think that's that's really important that a company at that size right generalists may not win all the time right and there there's probably opportunity in the specialization would you agree with that absolutely 100% And and that's what we did we literally split split our team and there was nine people we had three people who did this thing they all sat together it was like I was coaching three different teams yeah um and we still hit the numbers we were expected to hit overall because these people were just focusing on that one thing yeah um we broke quota multiple times they kept changing it you hear those stories all the time yeah yeah it it happens that's cool that's I mean that's probably a pride point for you as a boss though right is that oh we we broke the comp plan because we did too well it it is it's one of those conversations you have with your team hey guys we're having an all hands just don't say anything we know it's going to happen we already know they're going to tell us that the it's going to be a 16-page deck telling us why we're winning because the quota just got tripled don't say anything just smile and Nod we'll figure it out get it yeah we'll figure it out yeah and that was about every quarter that's wild and so what year did you come in and what year were they acquired by Zillow so I came in three years before they were acquired got it um again we had 35 people we went from 35 people to 600 people in 3 years we acquired two companies we went IPO um and we made a lot of mistakes along the way uh our big win though was specialization like that was the big thing is by the time I left there was a team for everything that happened versus everybody doing all the things yeah that's inly pattern match kind of what you implemented in your in your pod in the early days yeah what was the like I think for a lot of people listening this I mean most of the people who listen to this are SAS Founders or aspiring SAS Founders right the there's always a lot of curiosity around acquisition stories right I know you obviously weren't the founder of Trulia but but you had a front row seat as a director into this whole process of how a company like that gets swallowed up by by a a massive company like Zillow what was that like for you guys it was a battle so um to to put it bluntly truly I hated Zillow and Zillow hated Trulia not like a a friendly thing like we will never buy them and we will never sell to them we hate them they suck what they do is bad that type like literally you have to drink the Kool-Aid and believe that what you're doing is great and what they're doing is bad when in all reality we were selling to the same audience and a similar product um and so it it was it was one of those things where we weren't going to get acquired but we wanted to win and so what we decided to do is we were number three in the space so we purchased number two and number four and we became number one in the space just barely ahead of Zillow and that's what kind of caused this thing and oh so those two Acquisitions were before the Zillow AC I got you yeah yeah and then we suddenly had a meeting and everybody's like they just said we are selling to Zillo and everybody's Jaws dropped to the like we thought it was a joke so you guys had no idea no no we had no idea this was happening behind the scenes I mean my director had no idea that this was happening behind the scenes that's Bonkers um when we found it out though there's a lot of cool stuff that happened and then you hear all of the bad stories about what happens with Acquisitions those things happen too because you can't have so many leaders so you have to decide who's bringing who in and who's going um I rode the wave pretty well and um jumped out right at the right time yeah uh cashed out and went into the next that's wild what did you have to manage like let me ask that differently what was your team experiencing when they realized that their company was getting sold to their biggest competitor their the hardest thing was um we were all under ndas and we couldn't say anything which is almost impossible to go tell the sales team stop stop texting everybody tell the salesperson to stop talking let see how that goes yeah um that that was a a big thing um the other thing was everybody the fear what's going to happen to me what about me what should I do and I had to let everybody know this is a thing that's going to happen at some point but today we have a job to do and tomorrow we have a job to do and if we want to hit our commissions we just need to buckle down and do our thing yeah um I always teach have always taught and still teach focus on what you can control MH you know leave the noise behind if you can't control the noise if you can go fix it if you can't leave it behind and just focus on what what's in front of you like that horse with blinders kind of yeah so you just kept him focused on the mission yeah and we we just kept winning and how did it go it went well um a lot of people left right before just because of fear MH uh a lot of fear of what if and and all of those things um but it I mean it it was awesome I'm I'm glad I was part of it for sure yeah do you think uh uh unfortunately that was my first startup okay so I thought this must be what it's like you know you just cash out and buy a house cool do you think it was a good acquisition for Zillow yeah I think it was um I mean what they were able to do is think of all the Cent now they they truly and Zillow sell to real estate agents and Brokers um so think of all the clients that Zillow didn't have because truly I had them and vice versa and so now they were able to bring this set of clients and this set of clients together and now you have other products and other things that you can sell to all of them so I'm sure it was good for him yeah interesting cool so you rode the W for a while I stuck with Zilla for a while eventually stepped off of that and then you went to five stars which also got acquired for a huge sum of money $330 million I think it was or something something of that that area yeah I sum up um how was that different from your from your kind of First Act in startup land yeah so my first act in startup land I didn't I I had never been taught as a sales leader that there's a process to Leading people I had always done it but I didn't really realize that and I never really realized you have to be a project manager as a sales leader because in a large corporate company there's a person that does the thing for you and in a startup you're the person that does the thing yeah um so when I when I came into uh Trulia and I asked my leader hey can who builds these decks for me and she laughed and she's like that's that's you um so but they did have processes when I left everything was flowing it was smooth sailing um they got rid of some of the basketball tables and ping pong tables and Kegs and stuff like that um went from wearing shorts and t-shirts to dress shirts and ties and back down and all around then I went to five stars and five stars was a very very small Customer Loyalty company uh they had three inside sales people in a loft in San Francisco taking inbound calls and they had outside sales team and that was it and and the goal was how can we build a large outbound sales team in Denver so day one literally day one the power was out I was building Ikea desks with a flashlight closing deals on my cell phone um and fast forward we ended up having about 130 people in a year and a half in the office um no processes that's not true there were processes they there were processes that were probably outdated and not processes for a small outbound startup um again culture was such a big thing they were really worried about let's hire a bunch of cool people and I just wanted to hire a bunch of people that could sell yeah um so that's that's a whole another story and one of the reasons why why I got into recruiting we'll probably get to that later but the the rapid growth at Trulia and at five stars is is really what got me to become a recruiter in in the first place uh but it was it was it was a wild ride we uh we knew if we got our $50 million series see we are all going to succeed and if we didn't then we probably wouldn't have a job and so it was those last two months before the serus C that you didn't there wasn't much sleep sure I mean literally we seven days a week we just had a grill at the office and everybody came in it was just expected man how do you what the part of this that's confusing to me is I feel like with a venture back startup especially one that's going for a series C and it's a make or break kind of thing it sounds like you were saying you had to convince people to hire on proficiency instead of culture like that feels so backwards to me can you describe what you were going through it it was Way backwards um it was really important that you hire the right type of person who fits the community which is is important you should do that when you're hiring anyway you should think about what are our core values and does this person match those like they're they had a policy we don't hire it's a great policy honestly it is a great policy but behind the scenes the policy was also we hire really cool nice people um and sometimes really cool nice people might not be great salespeople yeah um and so it was it was a matter of trying to convince everybody that we can hire really cool people who are winners who can also sell who can help get us to the next Next Level because winners are going to bring on winners and mediocre people are going to if you if you have a room of eight mediocre people and one successful person eventually that successful person doesn't want to be in that room anymore yeah because they're either going to be down to that level or they're carrying all the weight but if you have a room full of nine successful people they're all bouncing off of each other and figuring out how can we make each other better yeah so so what I did is I convinced them to of the three recruiting firms um that we had hired and I convinced them to let me take care of it and so I would get up at 3:00 a.m. every morning and I would Source candidates and I would set up interviews with them and I was interviewing people I wanted to talk to instead of people I didn't want to talk to um same it say it truly I was interviewing five hours a day every day people I didn't want to hire but I had to because we had quotas um which is how I learned to become a recruiter I I either had to like deal with it or I learned how to go Source candidates and so of those 600 people I probably sourced about 250 of them myself and of our 125 people at five stars I probably sourced like all but 10 the first 10 um yeah and and most of those came from trua and that's another story but I got in a lot of trouble for that so I mean it's it's a it's a universal truth of business though I mean good leaders bring teams bring teams along with them but you know you describe something Netflix calls it Talent density right and where and they have this principle of you know every hire should raise the overall like the average Talent density in the room and it sounds like that's what you were optimizing for when you're talking about the room full of a players b players kind of thing yeah it's super important um all right so I'm I'm a little bit mind blown right now that you as a sales director before you were a recruiter sourced and hired hundreds literal hundreds of people cuz it seems like you were doing the job of the people team and the sales director team kind of hand it off to yourself and so I guess that is a natural transition into doing recruiting for a living since you obviously got a knack for it um and enjoy it but how did you make that official right so I guess you stepped off of five stars after the acquisition um what made you want to go do this professionally yeah it's it's a great question and to to step back when I was when I was at Trulia I talked to the recruiting department they had a good recruiting department multiple times this is who I want to talk to I don't want to talk to anybody but this person and they they couldn't do that so I spent four months talking to the top recruiters watching videos reading books uh you know rinse and repeat yeah and that's that's how I got to there so when I left five stars um I worked for another small startup so I did it backwards I went winwin it's not on my LinkedIn profile nobody's ever going to hear the name nightmares still happen um usually it happens the other way around sure um but while I was working for them and and helping them I started um coaching and mentoring small SAS Founders over the weekends in the evenings it's kind of a passion I can make a little side money on it and one day I was driving home after after helping these people kind of build the business we built the processes uh I went in and helped close deals for them taught them how to do it and they asked me to hire a couple salespeople for them and I did and I was driving home and I thought you know I could have charged them for that they would have probably paid me and that's kind of where the aha moment and so I did it slowly Matt I basically I was working full-time for someone I also had two clients who I was helping build out their business and then my other full-time job on the side that nobody knew about was I was doing recruiting MH and I just did that until it got to a point where I couldn't afford to to work for this company any longer it was it was one of those things I'm not happy they they love shiny objects they don't follow process I'm here a lot I'm helping them make a lot of money but I'm actually making more with my side hustle that I enjoy more yeah so that was kind of that um the big win was the transition was right before covid the big loss is that the transition was right before Co so I went from having my best month ever in business February was our best best month ever for my recruiting business best month ever for the company in March I didn't have a job and I didn't have any clients so yeah I had to refigure it all out yeah what did I mean what did you do in that point um I pouted for like a day and then decided to suck it up and figure it out uh so I went back to all of my old recruiting clients and I figured nobody in the world is hiring right now because we don't know what's happening um but they all have sales teams mhm so they probably are going to need help making sure their sales teams can navigate the waters so I went back to coaching I went back to um I became like they it wasn't a thing at the time but I was a it's called a fractional VP of sales now so I just became fractional VP of sales for multiple of my clients and kept doing that and navigated until um it was okay till you could actually hire again that's interesting that's why the company's gstd coach first because that's where it started probably yeah uh it started several several years ago um um from from a company way back in Iowa before I was in in startups there was a round table with the top people in the company and the VP of sales and the last question was um and there was two of my people in the round table how would you describe your leader in three words or less and they both like literally in unison said he get done yeah and so he came up and he says these guys said you get done you should just name your team GSD so all my teams were named GSD after that and because I'm a coach it just yeah naturally was GSD coach I mean it's it's impossible not to notice hearing your story right I mean you're the guy that got up at 3:00 in the morning to Source candidates because the people you're getting handed weren't good enough and still running a sales team and hire 300 people so yeah I'm pretty sure you get done um it's impressive um all right so now I want to I want to go down the the recruitment rabbit hole for a minute because if I'm in the shoes of whoever's listening to this particular podcast you're in one of a couple of categories you're a Founder who needs to figure out how to be a salesperson because you're super early you're a Founder who's hiring salese your founder who I need to hire a sales director or your sales director who needs to hire sales people the point I'm saying is that there's no world in which being good at sales and being able to find great sales Talent isn't an ingredient regardless of what of what stage you're at everything comes back to sales that's just the reality um I've had a front row seat to this because I've worked with you personally and I've seen how you interview people but what I'd love to spend a minute or two on is I feel like you've got a very unique interview style and like vetting approach when you um interview sales reps as a recruiter can you break down how you make sure they're legit in your conversations yeah and and this I think this is really important because I have this conversation all the time with Founders who say man we've we've missed like we've tried this we've tried to hire people and they didn't make it they weren't successful we hired the wrong person um I I think that the first thing is you have to be able to know who you need to hire so before we even get to how do you break it down you have to understand so for instance if you're an SMB so a very transactional $700 a month company you don't want to and you have no sales team you don't want to hire an Enterprise salesperson from Salesforce yeah they don't like they won't go together there there's going to be our of breaks um but assuming you know you have the right type of qual qualified person you're talking to then we have to assume that salespeople like to embellish a little bit and sometimes they like to inflate their numbers um I'm a huge fan if they can't prove their process and they can't prove their numbers then they aren't moving on plain and simple I'll give them a chance if they make a mistake um but what I basically do Matt is early on in the conversation and by the way I know their numbers because I've looked at LinkedIn I've looked at their resume and if they don't have winning numbers on their resume they've either been at their job for eight years and they aren't looking for something or they're probably not successful because the best sales people put their winning numbers everywhere I mean that's what you do yeah even if you don't put on LinkedIn it's on your resume so I'm first I've already written down all their data points that that they have on there if they have them um then I'm going to ask multiple questions uh one of them early on is what was your quota and then I'm going to talk about other things for a bit and then I'm going to circle back around and I'm going to ask what percentage to quota did you hit and then I'm going to talk for 20 minutes or 10 minutes and then I'm going to circle back around and go I forgot to ask how much did you sell those three should match so I want to break this down so the quota is how much in probably annual bookings they were expected to sell in a given period of time we'll use a million dollars millionar then you say what was your percentage to quota meaning as a percentage how much of that million did they sell which they said 75% so 750k and then 10 minutes later when you say hey remind me how much did you sell you're expecting them to come at you with that 750,000 number yes yes so a good example of the million doll I I had somebody who was crushing like overc crushing it everything was too perfect um he said a million dollar quota I hit 120% to plan and then he told me he sold $800,000 and I saido hold on your numbers don't match I'm calling BS right now yeah he said what do you mean they don't match and I said what is 120% of a million he said 1.2 and I said what percentage would 800,000 be and he said 80% I said so you know math but the math you told me doesn't make any sense so I called BS why don't you walk me through it and he said okay I was pacing 120% I was at 800,000 and that was laid off like cool lead with that yeah be honest that's okay it's okay if you missed quota because of a thing yeah but tell the truth yeah um that's a small part of it but I also want to I want to find out how do they how do they get to this this number so I I ask them things like what is your average um deal size what is your average sales cycle how many deals do you close in a month I'm asking a lot of things not back to back to see does the math work yeah um because there's you want to find out does the math work do they understand the math um even if it's a company believe it or not there's companies that don't track any of that they don't even have a CRM yeah blows me away but even if nothing's tracked the sales people if they're good they know they know they know their numbers yeah inside and out so even if for whatever reason the company didn't have a quota which baffles me but if they didn't they still had a goal yeah they still know what they should be going for and they know what they sold how do you I want to go back to something you said a little bit earlier when you said before you even get to this point it's all about knowing who you need to hire and you used an example of saying if you're selling into smbs into small businesses with a you know $500 or $700 a month product if you hire a rep from Salesforce it's going to be it's going to be a bad time right so my question is what are the commonalities that you need to look for like how do you assess your business and a candidate's resume and make sure that they match yeah this is this is where I spend most of my time um working with potential or new clients and I told you this earlier a lot of potential clients I talk to are not ready to hire and they don't know that they're not ready to hire because you first need to understand what are you trying to accomplish are you trying to um let's say for instance you're trying to buy back your time but you you are a CEO who is the only salesperson who doesn't like running demos and so you want to hire an SDR which which is an appointment setter right that's not going to buyback your time first off it's going to take more of your time to coach and teach that person because it's probably a junior person and then you're going to be running more demos which you don't want to do in the first place so it's it's understanding like why am I trying to hire somebody what am I trying to accomplish and then what is that profile that fits into this role so if if it's SMB then it should probably be somebody who understands selling SMB if it's mid the big difference for the audience is if you're closing a $300,000 deal that's going to take you 6 9 12 months and you have to do a lot of multi-threading you're going to talk to a lot of people if you're closing a $800 a month deal it might be a one call close yeah and those are two totally different types of mentalities and the way you think about it so it's let's figure out first have they closed our types of deals our deal sizes I know a lot of people want somebody who sold their thing before sometimes if it's a very very very Niche that's important but for the most part that's not as important is have they sold your your size deal your deal cycle um have they sold into the space and maybe have they sold to the type of people that you're selling to interesting the other thing is if it's a Founder Le SAS organization with 10 people this sale and you have never hired a salesperson before you don't know what you don't know and so even if you think your process is great you need to hire somebody that's already been in that situation who's already been the first second or third salesperson on a team because they're going to understand I know I might be going this direction today but tomorrow I might have to be over here and I'm good with that yeah whereas that person from sales force has an SDR booking the meetings for them they have somebody building their decks they have somebody helping them close the deals they have a sales engineer they have all those people helping to do the things when it's your first hire that's the person doing the things um and and as you get larger then that changes right so for instance if it's somebody's very first hire um it might be an SD depending on what they want it might be an account executive it might be a sales director it totally depends on what are they wanting to accomplish and how quick do they want to get there that's interesting you said something that that I want to understand a little bit better you said if you're in a Founder Le sales organization which like most of the clients we work with at least when we start working with them in the academy are founder Le sales and then they eventually they they grow their way past that but said if you're a founder-led sales organization even if you think you have a great Playbook even if your processes are dialed in it sounds like what you were saying was the processes for a rep will be different than the processes that work for a Founder how they 100% how are they different because the rep's job is to close deals or whatever you're hiring them for let's just assume in this case you're hiring an account executive A salesperson to close new business that's their job the founders job is to close new business bring on funding or whatever that is run the business do all of the things spend all of the plates and so they're most likely they most likely don't have an amazing pipeline in their CRM if there is a CRM yeah and they most likely even if they don't realize that are cherry-picking the type of leads that they're taking because they don't want to waste their time talking to people that they shouldn't be talking to because they don't have time to do that and so let's say this founder spending two to three hours a day selling the salesperson is going to spend eight hours a day selling and also the process might be in the Founder's head and it's hard to tell somebody what's in your head unless it's already been mapped out like Dan teaches make sure you put everything on video so you show all of these things um but the salesperson wants to come in and they want to say give me the Playbook let me run with it and if it's not a great Playbook they're going to run into a wall and they're going to wonder why things aren't going also they don't have the ER title it's a little bit easier if the CEO goes to a conference does a speaking engagement and somebody's seen them for the third time and then he has a meeting with them or she has a meeting with them they have more credibility to close the deal than somebody who says I've been working here for a month yeah so that was what I was going to ask is you know historically what we see in the companies we work with is when a Founder hires their first one or two reps the close rate drops sometimes drops materially but it seems like the rep is the one doing this for a living and they're doing it8 hours a day and I think a lot of Founders don't expect the close rates to be lower they expect them to be higher is it all a credibility thing or there other factors that go into that there's other factors usually in in my it especially with the clients that we work with most most of the time and those are as you know these are the clients I've been working with for eight years same type um what happens is the salesperson comes in and initially thing processes maybe aren't as tight as they need to be so they need to do some heavy lifting and they need to start learning they need to test try test adjust over and over and over until they figure it out and so while they're doing that their close rate goes down a bit there's a lot of pressure to have a high close rate um and the the founder so a they don't have that title of founder or CEO or whatever it is um is one thing too they don't they didn't build it like they don't know it inside and out as they don't have that passion yet where you know you talk to some of these Founders and you're like tell me a little bit about what you do and they're like they're so ecstatic you like want us close them down but you shouldn't yeah and it's going to take a while for the salesperson to get to that point so what I usually see happen is sales closing average starts to droop down starts to droop down it tapers here and then it starts to come back up and often times after whatever that amount of time is depending the type the sale the closing average increases because now we can figure out what the CEO is doing we can figure out what that great salesperson's doing and we can start combining those two things and then it becomes better but you're right I I get a lot of a lot of times this look we might have had our best month ever but his closing or her closing average is much lower than mine and I'm like but you just had your best month ever that means they're they're putting in the Reps it's just going to take a while also you got to think about this if it's a 5-year-old business the CEO who's doing the deals has a 5-year-old pipeline this new AE has a one-month old pipeline so in five years that that person they're going to be closing higher deals because it just starts coming through huh so what I took from that is there's almost two versions of the sales process there's the founder sales process when it's the founder actually doing the calls doing the deals and there's a few Corners you can probably cut there because they could make up for it with the they built the product they know every inch of it they've got the passion they've got the track record and then there's what I would call the repeatable sales process which is essentially taking the magic from the founder some of those ingredients mixing it with the sales professional and that's what actually lets you sale yeah and and I would say every now and again I come across a Founder who says Travis I love selling I'm really good at this I have a process where if you hire somebody it'll be rinse and repeat yeah and I do get those as a matter of fact I'm working with run right now where we're hiring uh in September we hired their first salesperson in February we hired their second and now we're hiring their third because it's the process was already built yeah um but that takes that takes somebody that person also had been in sales for 10 years before they started their business sure so they kind of already got that so let's say you're a founder and you want to make sure that you've got the process set before you start hiring the salespeople what are the most common blind spots the founders have um well first we have to determine is this an inbound or outbound machine right so have meaning are a large amount of people filling out lead forms and saying Hey I want to talk to you yeah or doing free trials or whatever that looks like or do they not know who you are and you're just going after them so those those two things so it starts with a marketing channel yeah it really it really starts with what that looks like um and then I've tap back to the question yeah I sidetracked myself no it's all good is the um if you're a Founder that wants to have their playbooks dialed in before they hire the Reps like what are what are the blind spots the founders going to have yeah I I think first off they don't know what they don't know um so you you have to assume that whoever's going to be taking over The Playbook isn't going to be doing this two hours a day they're going to be doing it eight hours a day or however many hours they're working so so that's that's one thing also you have to assume that they're probably not going to be able to cherry pick as as often um because if if this Founders able to close five deals a month and that's okay but they're expecting the salesperson to close 15 deals a month it's a totally different motion yeah um the way to set them up for success is to already have a pipeline ready for them when they start if possible right whatever that looks like it could be an inbound pipeline it could be from all everything marketing's done it could be a win back which is one of my favorite pipelines winback being this is somebody who you talk to at some point that didn't buy but maybe had an okay reason for not buying at the time and most likely those leads have not been touched for years they're just sitting there you got to go warm them up again you got to go warm them up again yeah so having a pipeline for him the the one that came into my mind that I love your opinion on is is metrics cuz you're you're big on metrics you're big on data and I was sitting here listening to you explain you know quota and percentage to quota and I I look at myself and my co-founder in my first company and we couldn't have answered those questions you wouldn't have hired us to close a door man we wouldn't have passed your first screen um and it was it wouldn't have been until the sales team was built out that we would have started caring about measuring all of those things and knowing the quotas and you know we worried about revenue insur and building the product so what are the metrics that the founder who's still doing sales like if they want to start measuring now so that way they can have a seamless handoff when they hire the team what are the what are the metrics they need to be looking at and that that's uh a great one you need to know the metrics because your top salespeople when they're talking to you they're going to ask you those questions and they're going to want to know how did you come up with my On Target earnings on target being salary plus commission um and if you're just throwing a dart or asking a friend um the top salespeople AR aren't going to work with you anyway um but you you need to the data and all it's it's pretty simple just pull up the reports in your CRM look at every single thing that you do every activity if if there's a dial you should track every dial that happens if there's a conversation you should track every conversation what you really want to know is when I get a lead either coming in or I reach out to somebody how many things have to happen before I get a close MH like what what are the steps and what's the whole process and most most likely when they start looking at that they're going to have that aha oh moment where they realize this is the thing that's broke I didn't know this was broke and now I figured this thing out which by the way is how you also coach those salespeople is if you are having your weekly meetings every week and you're walking through the numbers and suddenly something doesn't feel right you can probably see that it has to do with activity yeah some type of activity isn't happening right but it it's I always say you have to know your numbers inside and out you have to know everything about what you're doing and the easiest way is for the founder just to take a lot of my top clients will take one of the founders and they'll literally turn off everything they're doing for two to three months before they hire and they're just a sales rep for two to three months that's what they're doing over and over and after about a week they're like oh I see this thing that's broke we need to fix that before we hire somebody so you're saying your best clients will take whichever founder is doing sales and essentially remove all of their other responsibilities as much as they can as much as they as much as they can right it won't be all of them of course but and essentially try to scope them into just being a salesperson as much as possible to get them closer to the process so they see all the details yep and then once once they have a process in a system then all you do is you just record every activity like literally anything that you're doing sales related you should have a camera on you and you should be recording it so then when somebody says what does the onboarding look like oh I have your onboarding yeah it's this here it is deal yeah that's interesting um cool so when we talk to Founders in the academy one of the most common things we hear is I want to get out of founder lead sales I want to exit founder lead sales I want someone to solve sales for me and I've got some strong opinions on this topic but I'm going to keep it myself for a minute because I'd love to hear from you when someone says they want to exit founder Le sales what is the most common mistake that you think they're getting ready to make um the number one thing is trying to move out too soon so this is their business this is their baby they built it they're at 500 K AR they're at 10 million AR whatever it is they've done that on I shouldn't say on their own with their team without a sales team they've done that and they've got there and what a lot of times is I'm stressed I'm fed up and I know I need to buy back my time and put my energy somewhere else and I need to do that today yeah and so what happens is they hire a person saying I need you just to go do all these things you got it I trust you and they don't monitor they don't help they don't they they step away stepping away from being the salesperson isn't the same as not being a sales leader so a lot of lot of times what they need to do is they need to keep doing the things they need to keep selling they need to keep closing and they need to make sure that the salesperson gets what they're doing and understands it and they need to keep doing it until the salesperson is bringing in money so they don't get stressed over here once they've got that then you slowly start to step away and I think that's the biggest mistake is in my mind it's time for me to stop selling and it's okay by the way to stop selling if you hire the right people to do it but you need to make sure that they're doing it yeah you and I see eye to eye on this so there's two jobs there's the selling and there's the leading of the selling right there's being the sales leader y yeah and so my strong opinion was exactly what you just said it's that I think Founders sometimes will conflate the two things where I need some of them to take my sales calls I need to hire a rep versus I need to get the hell out of sales entirely and I don't never want to deal with it again and it sure would be great if customers kept showing up right one of them can work right the first one can work I just need someone on the phone I need someone doing the deals yes but just because you can stop being a rep as a Founder doesn't mean you can stop being a sales leader until you have someone to be the sales leader for you yes yeah and and so even if you thinking why don't I make my first sales hire a director they they can run the show that's true but you still need to teach them how to run the show you still need to teach them your business and what you're doing and you need to remove obstacles and roadblocks out of their way so they can go do the hard work and the heavy lifting and then start hiring the team um but if you're going to hire a sales director and it's your first hire you need to make sure you're hiring somebody that understands that their job is to sell first and Lead later otherwise they're going to quit after three months when they thought the job was to lead a team that doesn't exist yeah and this goes back to what you were saying before about matching the SE the deal size and the sales cycle of your company to the person you're trying to hire I think there's also another element to that that I've done poorly at times which is matching the size of company that you're hiring from to the size of company you're hiring into cuz a sales director that's got experience at a $2 million annual revenue startup is a vastly different higher than a sales director same title at Zillow oh yes know it's it's a totally different game the um when I'm going through the the process with new clients and you know one of the questions I ask is how many people are in your company all those things yeah if they tell me 10 15 20 when I start my Boolean search on LinkedIn the very first thing I'm doing is I'm checking the box under 50 people in the company yeah like I there's no reason to get somebody that's in those large companies it's a super super easy for anybody that's doing their own searches that's the very first thing you should look for yeah I think people get uh I get enamored with this thought of like this person's been in this big company so they can help my company be big too but they don't realize there's probably seven different sales director hires between million and 100 million most likely yeah there there are now it's it's okay to have somebody that's in a big company if they've done it yeah so I I often see somebody who was a startup specialist and then they graduated these large companies and they're not happy because they're used to having a voice and they're not used to just being another number and they don't like it and usually when you're in the small companies you can call up the founder and say hey I have this idea and you can talk about it when you're in the large companies you have an idea in maybe three or four years down the road somebody might consider doing something about it so I I love to poach those people when I see that they spent four years building this company or these two companies out and they've moved here and I'm guessing they probably aren't as happy as they thought they would be but the move I will tell you from a small company to a large company is easier than from a large company to a small company I would agree with that by by far by far yeah for sure all right so so you've roach this topic of hiring a sales director and I think that hiring a rep is still difficult but more straightforward right I think you can you also have a shorter feedback loop you can figure out more quickly if they're good or not the consequence of letting that person go is less hiring a sales director for me at least is a very high stakes hire it's one that I would be really disappointed in myself if I get wrong and I would encourage any founder listening to this like take that hire seriously yeah so my question for you Travis I'm going is H I mean how many sales directors have you hired at this point or recruited hundreds hundreds yes okay so been around the block what how do you evaluate a sales director to make sure that you nail the hire the first time we need to Circle back to what I said earlier you first need to know who you want so and you need to know where you're at so think about this Matt if you have zero salese you're looking for a certain type of sales director if you have a team of five people you're looking for a certain sales director and if you have 50 people you're looking these are three totally different hires if it's 50 people this is a person that is leading their job is to come in and lead and make sure the troops are selling if there's five people they're probably a player coach they're leading but they probably are going to have a number that's assigned whether it's their number or the total number and they have to make sure that happens which means they have to be picking up the phones and talking to people yeah um if you have nobody you need to find somebody that likes doing this they like to come in and figure it out from scratch and be a salesperson and do all the hard work and the heavy lifting get the wins get the victories and then build a scalable and repeatable process and then start bringing a team in um and then teaching them the same thing so there's three different really types of people so you got to figure that out first like that's the that's the big thing the mistakes that I see people do uh people make is they don't explain to the director what their actual role will be when they start so you have Betty let's say who has been leading at her company a team of 10 salespeople she started out as the only person now there's a team of 10 and she's been leading them for two years and all she's doing is leading and she's also working with sea level and she's working with marketing and she's doing all these things but you want her to be your first sales hire and you're not explaining to her what that looks like she's gonna come in and she's gonna say I I graduated from this yeah where is everyone yeah this isn't what I signed up for so you need to you need to kind of understand that I think is is a big thing and then as far as sales hires um you can ask about their process and their quotas as sales directors you need to learn um walk me through how how often you're actually in the trenches selling walk me through what a week in the life looks like for one of your salespeople oh that's interesting walk me through your coaching how often do you touch them what are you like I want to find and then first let's find out if they're even getting their one-on ones and if they're even getting their coachings and then walk me through each person on your team's data and their numbers and who's your top salesperson why who's your bottom salesperson and why and I want to see how they think about this and then you're going to ask the powerful question if they're managing a team so you said you have seven people on your team two people are always over quota two people are always under quota and there's three that seem to sit in the Middle where do you put most of your time and by hearing that answer you start to learn what type of leader they are what answer are you looking for in that question not looking for them to say I'm spending most of my time in the bottom yeah because you still need to coach the bottom people but sometimes bottom people are bottom people and if you spend too much time on them you're not putting the energy where you should which is those people in the middle who want to be those top people so I always say focus on the middle most of your time should be spent with those middle people if they want if they have the desire it's the will versus skill um if they have the will I'm going to spend my time with them I'm still going to touch the top reps I'm still going to work with them because they need it but I'm working with them in a different way yeah I'm just asking what do you need I'm not coaching them the way I'm teaching the bottom people and so that's the next question is okay so you're having your one-on ones walk me through what your one last one-on-one look like with your top rep and then walk me through what your last one-on-one look like with your bottom rep and if those are the same yeah if those are the same there's a problem with this leader because you should be having you're GNA have the basic things you talk about how are things going what can I help you with um what obstacles are you facing what does your pipeline look like but then there's this person's getting a lot of coaching and this person I'm probably giving something to I'm probably going to have let's talk about you running the next sales meeting let's talk about that type of thing and this person I'm talking about I hate to have this conversation with you but you literally aren't hitting your numbers because you're not working you just like literally you're not picking up the phone yeah which is a conversation you don't want to have to have anyway but you do so hope that's helpful yeah for sure this could be three hours man yeah no I I I'm picturing hopefully if you're hiring sales leaders you just had a pen and a piece of paper out during that one because those are a lot of really specific like tactical questions with right answers and wrong answers that people should be asking that was really well done they they are and you you just need to you really really need to understand what does their process look like and what does their team's process look like and then you need to understand if you could change something that's holding you back from doing better what would that be because now now you're going to find out is this somebody who takes responsibility for things or is this somebody who blames others yeah that's a whole another conversation well it's a conversation I want to have because um one of the things that I've run into in my own companies but also in Founders that I've coached there's a little bit of this tension right where as a leader if you have someone who's not performing you're trying to figure out like yes I want to take ownership over it because I'm a leader and maybe I've built a container that's not setting them up to win maybe the pricing is wrong maybe the offer is weak whatever or maybe the rep just isn't good right and so my question is how do you tell the difference when you're evaluating someone's performance between is this a a competence and skill issue where this employee simply can't measure up and I need to replace them or have I actually built a system that's setting them up to fail and do I need to go change something with my product or my pricing or my offer or something else that the rep can't influence how do you tell the difference between those two things that's that's a lot to unwrap so um if you have let's say it's are we two different situations this is their first salesperson or this is just somebody on a team let's say it's somebody on a team okay cuz it's a little I see where you're going because if you have somebody on a team you already have have active action points so you can literally know if you do the average of what everybody is on our team in activity you should come to this result so the first thing you can do is look and say are they even doing the minimal minimum activity that's required because it could be that they just aren't putting in the Reps somewhere hold on let me let me interject for a sec so what you're saying is if you have a performance issue and it's your first salesperson it's more likely that there's a systemic issue that you probably need to solve as the founder but if you have a sales team and there are other nonf founding salespeople who are performing then your your BS threshold should be a little bit different at that point because there are other people who are already getting the result and you should be able to reproduce that yeah yeah so the first thing I'm always looking at is effort yeah the the will are you just putting in the Reps right is that that's the first thing um then then I want to figure out um do they care like do they actually give a is this somebody who's just checking in and are are they fine with what they're doing yeah um that's a whole another story and the other thing if they're the first salesperson you should ask them like I mean when I hired you Matt like you showed me all these success from your last two companies tell walk me through what's holding you back like what's up and you might learn something you didn't know they might just tell you the pricing sucks yeah or what whatever this thing is is broken and we need to fix that thing or they might not know the answer which is a whole different story um if they have no idea what's holding them back then we need to dig in and figure out what's holding them back easiest way to do that is to listen to their calls like I two months ago I talked to a a founder and I asked how is he has one salesperson I asked how that person's doing he said he's doing pretty good I said what is pretty good and he said well he's hitting the numbers I want him to hit but he's just not getting better and I said walk me through your coaching and he's he's been with me for about six months we have one-on ones once a week when's the last time you listen to one of his calls I I don't know when's the last time he coached himself on one of his calls he's like he's never done that before can you unpack that yeah so I want every salesperson to be coached on three calls every week sounds like a lot but they should do at least one if not two of them they should literally listen to their call and they should score themselves oh so they listen to their own call and it's self- evaluate and it's self evaluation because I'm going to because I want to listen to that call and I want to see are they right did they get where the mistakes are if I tell you what you need to improve upon you might think I'm full of crap you might think I just picked a bad call but if you tell you what you need to work on it's it's different so this founder I said just pick a call and listen to it he's like oh my God that was terrible he got down to the close and they said he said but it's probably too much money for you right ouch and then he didn't close a deal and he then he coached him and he W they listened to the call together and he improved just like that because you sometimes you start making mistakes we all do and there's nobody there watching us to remind us that we should have taken a right instead of a left we just forgot you know and sometimes you need that GPS person there to tell you that's a beautiful example of what you talked about earlier when we talked about founder Le sales the difference between having a rep and stepping out of the leadership role right like that's a great example of a job that the whoever is in the sales leadership role in that case the founder still needs to be doing that has an immediate impact on close rate and revenue oh yeah absolutely and let the salesperson pick their calls let them pick at least two of the calls you're going to coach them on and you pick one of them them because they what if all three of those are terrible yeah then there well yeah but you just picked my worst three let them pick a couple that they want to be coached on I want them to give me one they want coaching on and I want them to give me one where they feel like they blew it out of the water and they're impressed and they want you to hear it huh because that might still be a bad call yeah it's possible that's interesting I love it um it really I I really love how you're reinforcing the importance of getting the call recorded and and that's something that ideally is done before you even hire a salesperson right like you should start recording your own calls and then you've got the examples of what good looks like 100% um what a lot of uh found Founders who hire their first salesperson do is they sit on the initial call and they watch and they coach during the call and although that might help early a couple of times you're not helping them you're actually making it worse for them coach after the the call after they've had time to absorb it but not during the call because maybe they're going a certain direction and you just threw something out there to them yeah yeah that's interesting I can tell if I put myself in the shoes of the rep the difference between like Travis and my zoom chat telling me what to say real time and I'm just a puppet who's getting my strings pulled versus me taking a shot potentially missing reviewing my own recording coaching myself bringing it to you and saying here's where I think I missed what else do you see like one of those things makes me better at my job the other one is just you making me a puppet you know well and there's nothing wrong with a puppet early early on right away just to to help them but you get only a little bit just a little bit yeah that's cool all right I want to um I want to leave this podcast with a very common emotion I would call it that I hear from a lot of Founders and I want to know what your response is to it so you've you know I love that you've got the direct experience the recruiting experience and the coaching experience cuz I think they all the V diagram is it's not quite a circle but it's pretty close one of the things we hear a lot with early stage Founders and I was one of these people by the way is I don't like sales I don't like to sell I don't want to be salesy or whatever that means right what do you say to those Founders where are they going wrong and what what beliefs do they need to crush they're probably looking at sales the wrong way um you know let's say that you are a founder and you want to bring on funding and you're presenting to a board you're probably going to exude so much passion and excitement and you're going to be nervous and you're going to be scared but you ooze that excitement that's sales that is sales and so when you talk to a a brand new one of the coaches from SAS Academy talks to a brand new client who just came on and they say tell tell me what you do and they get nervous and they get excited and they walk them through and pretty soon they have the perfect pitch after a while um that's sales that is it's passion about what you do and what they're saying what they mean what they say are two different things I don't like having to talk to people to try to sell them our product I don't like having to ask for money I don't like answering objections that's different than I don't like sales because I think if you are customer facing you are in sales anywhere yeah like some people are bad some people are good but you're in sales if you talk to somebody at some point you because you're representing your company yeah and and so I I think that the best advice I can give is when you're thinking I don't like sales what is it that I don't like about sales and let's fix that whatever that is maybe they don't like it because they hate cold calling like they hate cold calling yeah and if you hate cold calling have you actually tried to work on your marketing department to drive inbound leads because maybe you like closing deals yeah so it's kind of figureing out what is it that I don't like and if you don't like any of it it's okay let's just get somebody in here and teach them how to do it yeah that's interesting so so your advice to to kind of button it up is when we say sales doesn't actually mean anything because it can mean everything and so instead what we need to do is break it down into the parts like the different jobs and figure out which one is given you the the heartache and then reverse engineer a solution for that yeah yeah I I spoke with um someone last week uh it was a candidate screen and she said I absolutely hate my job like I I hate it with a passion and it took half an hour to unwrap what it was that she really didn't like about her job she just knew she hat she was so in involved I'm quitting here and I hate it but it took quite a bit to figure out what it was that she really didn't like and once we could figure that out then I knew what companies not to send her to to talk to yeah because they have those same things she doesn't like that makes sense so cool um so last year you wrote a book right yes um you of all people outrageous stories and billion dooll lessons um what's your favorite outrageous story from your book there's there's so there's so many um I think I I have a couple of stories and they're just about crazy the day-to-day things that I encounter when I talk to candidates that you you wouldn't believe like you you would think that I was making it up um I think one of the stories and this is is pretty crazy but I had a candidate reach out to me on LinkedIn one of my posts resonated with them they were able to find my website they saw that I had a job that was of interest to them um they reached out to me we had a couple of conversations I sent them my calendly link they booked a meeting with me seems pretty legit next day I called she answers the phone she's like who is this I said I'm Travis we booked a meeting I don't know who you are what you're talking about I'm like cool I just emailed you our conversation off of Link in and off of the email you're making this up and she hung up on like this kind of thing happens I don't know how but it does and you just have to you know shrug it off that's it just move on and be thankful that that happened before I screened her and missed that there was something wrong there yeah yeah get her into a company or something yeah man that's wild well Travis man you shared a lot of wisdom today I love the stuff about interviewing and about vetting sales directors and like the different types
