# The Wilde Agency Elevator Story

Finding the memorable through-line.

---

## Internal Truth (What You Believe)

**The Model:**
- Beautiful engineering + optimized AI protocol = rapid real products
- Many ventures = power law returns (many shots on goal)
- Lower friction and time of REAL product creation (not demos, not toys)
- We do this cleanly, repeatedly—that's the edge

**The Insight:**
The same discipline that makes US successful at venture creation makes us the best partner for YOUR project. We're not selling hours—we're sharing a machine that works.

## External Through-Line (What They Hear)

```
PROBLEM → FAST RELIABLE SOLUTION → OUR INSIGHT (we do this cleanly, repeatedly)
```

The insight is the differentiator: "We do this for ourselves. That's why we're good at it for you."

## Elevator Story Attempts

### Version 1: The Machine
> "You know how everyone's building software with AI now, but most of it falls apart the moment it meets real users?
>
> We built a machine—a platform, a process, a foundation—that creates production-grade software fast. We use it to launch our own ventures.
>
> Occasionally, we let the right project plug into that machine. That's Wilde Agency."

---

### Version 2: The Shots on Goal
> "Building real software—not demos, real products—is still hard. AI made it faster, but not easier.
>
> We cracked that. We have a system that lets us build production-grade software rapidly and repeatedly. We use it to take many shots on goal for ourselves.
>
> When we take on an outside project, you get access to that same system. That's why it works."

---

### Version 3: The Discipline
> "Most AI-built software is fast garbage. Real products need real engineering underneath.
>
> We've spent years building a foundation and a process that makes real software creation fast AND reliable. We use it to build our own ventures.
>
> When we bring in an outside project, you benefit from that discipline. We don't do it often. When we do, it's a different experience."

---

### Version 4: The Compound
> "Here's the thing about building software: it compounds. Every good decision makes the next one easier. Every shortcut makes the next one harder.
>
> We've been compounding good decisions for 30 years. That's our platform. That's our process.
>
> We use it to build ventures rapidly. Occasionally, we invite the right project to build on top of it. That's Wilde Agency."

---

### Version 5: The Cleanly/Repeatedly
> "Everyone can build a demo now. AI made that easy. What's still hard is building something that actually works—with real users, at scale, under pressure.
>
> We figured out how to do that cleanly and repeatedly. For ourselves. That's the venture studio.
>
> When we take on an outside project, you're not hiring an agency. You're joining a machine that was built to win."

## Shorter Punchy Version

### The Hook + Insight + Outcome

> "The problem: AI made building demos easy. Building REAL software is still hard.
>
> Our insight: We cracked it. We built a system that creates production-grade software fast and repeatably—for our own ventures.
>
> What that means for you: When we take on your project, you plug into that system. Fast, reliable, battle-tested. Not an agency—a machine."

## One-Liner Attempts

**Long:**
> "Wilde Agency is a venture studio that builds production-grade software rapidly and repeatably. We use that system to launch our own ventures—and occasionally invite the right outside project to build on it."

**Medium:**
> "We built a machine for creating real software fast. We use it for our ventures. Sometimes we let the right project plug in."

**Short:**
> "A venture studio that occasionally shares its machine."

## The Memorable Line Hunt

Looking for that one sticky phrase...

| Attempt | Phrase |
|---------|--------|
| 1 | "Not an agency—a machine." |
| 2 | "Fast garbage vs. fast AND good." |
| 3 | "We cracked real software creation." |
| 4 | "30 years of good decisions, compounded." |
| 5 | "The system we built to win—you plug into it." |
| 6 | "Demos are easy. Products are us." |
| 7 | "We built this for ourselves. That's why it works." |
| 8 | "A machine for real software. Occasionally shared." |
| 9 | "Production-grade, repeatedly." |
| 10 | "Experience × AI. Not a tagline—a system." |

---

## The PEACE Version (If We Nail It)

| | Soundbite |
|---|-----------|
| **Problem** | "AI made demos easy. Real software—products that scale, don't break, actually work—that's still hard." |
| **Empathy** | "We know. We've built three startups. We've felt the gap between prototype and product." |
| **Answer** | "So we built a machine: platform + process + 30 years of patterns. We use it to launch ventures fast." |
| **Change** | "When we take on your project, you plug into that machine. Experience × AI." |
| **End Result** | "Real software, fast. Not because we rush—because the hard work is already done." |

## Which Direction?

**A. The Machine** - Emphasizes system, process, plugging in
**B. The Compound** - Emphasizes accumulated advantage, 30 years
**C. The Discipline** - Emphasizes real vs garbage, quality
**D. The Venture Angle** - Emphasizes "we do this for ourselves"

Or hybrid?

## Testing Frame

Say it out loud. Does someone respond:
- "Tell me more" ✓
- "How does that work?" ✓
- "Oh, interesting" (politely changes subject) ✗

The goal: They immediately get it AND want to know more.
