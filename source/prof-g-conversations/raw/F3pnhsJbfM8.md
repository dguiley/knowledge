work at a natural pace I think this idea that we're trying to mimic a factory setup in knowledge work come to an office 8 hours a day full intensity we're suspicious if at any point during that day you're not doing full intensity year round no change that's not very natural humans aren't good at that we need more variation we need Sprints and rest we need Seasons that are more busy than others we need to play the long game What's going to produce the most [Music] value cow where does this podcast find you uh I'm in Tacoma Park it's a small town outside Washington DC I'm in my my studio oh good for you so let's prast right into it in your new book slow productivity the Lost Art of accomplishment without burnout you share your philosophy for creating great work at a sustainable Pace what do you mean by slow productivity well it's meant to be an alternative to what we're currently implicitly using as our understanding of productivity and knowledge work which is what I call pseudo activity so I have this argument in the first half of the book that there was actually a large issue an economics issue when knowledge work emerged as a major sector because the Notions we had for measuring productivity that were developed first in agriculture and then carried over to Industrial manufacturing those Notions didn't apply anymore right we we couldn't count model T's per paid labor hour input we didn't have clearly defined production systems that we could tweak and see their impact and so I argue we fell back on a heuristic that I call pseudo productivity which says we'll use visible activity as a sort of crude proxy for useful effort so I I want to see you work more works better than less you want to be more productive stay late come early right Sol productivity is an alternative to that because my argument is that might have been okay for a while but it really began to falter when combined with the front office it Revolution that picked up steam in the late 90s pseudo productivity became less sustainable so slow productivity is an alternative that's based more on outcomes than activity and is more grounded in how humans actually operate what's actually going to be sustainable for humans I struggle with this or I worry about this with my son and that is he gets anxious about grade so he says I'm going to study all weekend and I ask him I'm like well do this get some real studying done for a couple hours and then take the rest of the day off isn't it aren't you basically arguing that kind of FaceTime does not necessarily translate or effort or anxiety doesn't necessarily translate to productivity yeah I think that's true and in fact that that specific example with your son I have a lot of grounding in when I got started in writing I wrote my first books when I was in my young 20s they were books for college students about how to study and the the big idea of those books is most college students are really bad at study they use studying as an ambiguous verb it's I'm just doing stuff I'm in the library I'm stressed they hope to alchemize the effort and distress of this vague type of studying the better grades I wrote this book that said you know what the best students they have really specific ways they study that works really well it takes them a few hours they nail the test they move on with their lives so I was actually sort of grounded in that idea for my days as a student writing for students and then bridging it to another personal experience in the Work World when I my my first company was a company called profit and we couldn't attract the quality or caliber of consultants for a small firm started by a 26-year-old that we needed to get kind of 4un 500 clients so I tapped into this untapped vein the labor force and that was um recent mothers who felt like they couldn't they couldn't commit to being in the office you know 9 hours a day five days a week and if you gave them a little bit of flexibility they would take the job and so I didn't care if they worked from home as long as they were in a couple times a week and I found I immediately registered right away they were the most productive employees cuz cell or high water they had to be on the train back home at a certain point yeah well I mean I think this is one of the the negative externalities of activity based productivity is you take these type of options off the table right so if it's look activity is what we look for more activities better than less you're basically biasing towards 24 year olds right out of college with no families and and nothing else to do right because if if activity is what we value you're narrowing that lens so it's one of the advantages you get when you begin to Value more things like expertise like experience like leadership like know how like a long track record of things you've produced over time that have been very valuable it allows a a lot of different people into the workforce a lot of different configurations of work into the workforce as well where we in a pseudo productivity regime we look with suspicion when someone wants to work let's say flexible hours or they want to work less than full-time or they want to take a leave because of things happening within their family situation in a pseudo productivity regime that's suspicious well that's just producing less value I'm therefore going to devalue you and your contribution in more of a slower productivity regime a lot of that becomes a lot more acceptable what we care about is what you can do what have you done what skills you have to do something cool in the future and interesting in the future so so I think this is absolutely right uh when we focus on activity we really narrow what work can really mean what successful work can really mean you have three principles of slow productivity break them down for us do fewer things uh this is really an argument about workload management I think it's one of the biggest unforced errors in modern knowledge work is that we allow individuals workloads to to SP out of control this doesn't make people more productive in any sort of objective sense of the term because everything you agree to brings with it administrative overhead so when you agree to 10 things versus five you're doubling the administrative overhead which means you're having the amount of time available to actually do work so I think uh workload management being something that we ignore and allow uh list of tasks and commitments to grounded control it's a real unforced error the second principle is work at a natural pace I think this idea that we're trying to mimic a factory setup in knowledge work come to an office eight hours a day full intensity we're suspicious if at any point during that day you're not doing full intensity year round no change that's not very natural humans aren't good at that we need more variation we need Sprints and rest we need Seasons that are more busy than others we need to play the long game What's going to produce the most value and then the final principle is obsess over quality the biggest bullwark we have towards the Allure of busy is to get good at things craft is like a an antidote to the poison of excessive busyness as you care more and more about doing something well the more the idea of just being very busy being very visibly just displaying the performance of work the more that becomes anathema so the final principle is this idea of let's make craft what we focus on not activity so I have a very kind of a boomer mentality around this and that is and I'm very open to push back here where I have this wrong or or you know I love your color here but I've always thought that if you want to be economically in the top 10% much less the top 1% that it just requires a certain level of commitment around not only productivity but just sheer time that output is going to be a function I think of productivity times the amount of time you apply to something and then unless you're smart enough to be born rich if you want to attain real Economic Security there is going to be a certain extended periods of your life where you're working a great deal where do I have that wrong I don't disagree with that uh what I think matters is what you're aiming that effort towards right so I think a trap that people get in is that during this period of busyness they focus it on things that aren't actually pushing forward their value to the market so I am in on every meeting I'm quick to respond to the emails I'm volunteering for every small thing that comes forward as opposed to I'm really locked in on trying to get very good at this thing that's unambiguously valuable to the market so I mean I agree with you if you want to get to the top 1% there's a huge amount of hours involved in that there's a huge amount of grinding I think that's just a property of the jobs that get you to the top 1% of incomes this is just how Major law firms are structured this is just how Finance is structured for example but if you want to be in a situation where you're financially secure and you have a lot of autonomy in the shape of your working life and how it fits into the other aspects of your life building a skill that's unambiguously valuable that's the number one lever you have the poll that's what's going to ow you to say this is where I live oh I work uh these months and not this month I'm taking a sabatical uh I don't do meetings right you want that type of autonomy that really slow productivity that's all going to be based on unambiguous skill this thing I do is valuable other people can't do it now I'm going to start dictating how I want to actually apply it I love that term unambiguous skill and I think a lot of young people think okay I have the context for that maybe I have the certification they like to think they have the core for character and attributes to develop an unambiguous skill that's highly differentiated can't be replaced easily and I often hear people talk about that your 20s are for workshopping H H do you have you thought about the steps in the atmospherics for a young person to try and figure out identify and then develop what is ultimately that unambiguous skill you know uh a decade ago when when I was first entering the job market out of grad school entering the academic job market I wrote a book all about this because I really cared about this question of how do you engineer the right career so I wrote this book called so good they can't ignore you and it was all about this idea uh building up what I called Career Capital so one of the tricky things that came out of that book is that it's difficult to figure out what's valuable and it takes a lot longer than you think when you're in your 20s to actually get good at those things and and I ended up advising young people after this book came out to spend even more time that I emphasize almost treating their own field like you're a business journalist like I am studying my own field I really want to understand who is getting ahead in this field like who's the stars in this field why are they the stars in this field like what was it that they did that other people didn't do what really mattered for them often these answers aren't what you think they're going to be or what you want them to be I also emphasize it takes longer like I came out of uh College sort of moving hot right I was like this what I want to do computer science and writing this is what I want to do I want to be a I want to be a professor and I want to write it took me about a decade before I got anywhere notable in either of those a decade of really solid building my life around computer science and writing and this is all I do and I'm not going to be distracted by this it's head down systematically trying to get better uh it wasn't until I hit my young 30s after a decade of work that I had really made what I would say our publicly visible notable steps forward it took me a decade to get my first sort of major hard cover idea book out it took me a decade to get hired as a a 10year track Professor so it often this is the advice I tell young people spend more time than you think to figure out what matters spend more time than you want to get good at it yeah you're getting no sympathy from me you're talking to a guy who wrote his first book at 52 I think by it's just so funny to listen to you because you're a young man you can't objectively evaluate time you came out of the gates rocking and rolling I I don't care what you think about yourself I can tell you someone who's older than you and I've seen a lot of people you came out hot at a very early age what were the things or the attributes of the people or the surroundings that helped you get on the tene track so quickly and have a best-selling book in your 30s most PE most people just don't accomplish that at that age that is ridiculously young you're just you're just not old enough to realize how young you are so to speak but in your 20s what do you think were the primary influences and decisions you made they gave you the ability to do that kind of stuff in your 30s well one thing I think that influenced me is that I'd been an entrepreneur when I was a teenager so I was a teenager under late 90s right so this was the first.com boom we weren't very smart in that boom uh you remember we had this moment where we thought 16 year olds they must know a lot about technology because they're young so let's sign contracts with 16 year olds to to come redevelop our sort of web press mentors yeah exactly exactly so they I had a a Preposterous business in the 90s um but that had exposed me a lot to the entrepreneurship and business literature the pragmatic non-fiction literature I was steeped in this stuff at a very young age age and so I came to college with a different attitude right I came to college saying this is a problem to solve just like any other entrepreneurial problem and in fact when I went looking for the right books as a college student okay how do I win at this game how do I study how does this work I was so disappointed in what I saw because in the late 90s early 2000s the the sentiment in the publishing industry is to write a book for a student you had to be cool it had to be like hey like college is kind of fun don't talk too much about success because you're going to scare off the kids like the number one best-selling College guide in the year 2000 was the naked roommate and it was like and other Tales of like well so I had this idea like this is nonsense uh I'm G to write a book about how to do well in college exactly like a business book so I was bringing a sort of entrepreneur business mindset that would be completely non-exceptional to someone who is mid-career and I was bringing that to to the world of college and the thing is it worked really well so I got very systematic about what's the right way to study what's the right way to write papers and like that experience to me oh by just getting serious about how you do this the mechanics of work that made such a big difference I had to write a book about that I wanted to bring that mindset so this I had this interesting sort of dual experience in college where I was there in college but I also felt like I'd already graduated 10 years earlier this sort of impatience to get out there so that's how I got started writing like I'm going to write the college book I didn't have um and so that's what I was like and so I sort of came out of the gates hot because I was there in college already ready to be 30 if that makes sense I I sort of couldn't wait to get out and start doing things how has your domain expertise and your study of productivity changed the way you allocate your time uh in your personal life how's your personal life changed well I mean one of the things I figured out pretty early in grad school is just strict separation uh this was a an anxiety deci anxiety diffusing technique I guess if we're going to call it anything was okay I had to have a strict separation between working and non-working and that's what I did so in grad school I just established a standard um I'm going to work standard work hours which is unusual in grad school because you don't have to work standard work hours in grad school but uh I got married young and and my wife was working standard hours so like great I'm just going to match my work to to when she's working and outside of that no work and I just work backwards from that standard and I've more or less kept that ever since work fits in work hours and when you're done you need to shut it down like there needs to be the strict separation between when you're working and when you're not if your work doesn't fit then you need to scale back or get more efficient but these are the the lines in the sand is like these are the hours I work so I innovated that in grad school when I had a lot of flexibility and have stuck with it ever since do you have kids K I have three how is it change your approach to fathering well I think it helps this idea that uh when I'm done I'm done because I can synchronize that pretty closely with I'll start after they go to school and I can finish pretty soon after they get home but the three kids they influenced slow productivity in particular uh because of the timing of when I wrote that book it was when I have all boys when they got Elementary School age as they all sort of approached Elementary School age is where there was this switch where they seemed to need maximal bad time which was different than before it was this every minute I could possibly give them uh was important in a way that when your kids are toddlers or babies it's much more of a sort of survival play you know hey let's just keep these things alive and prevent either of you know me or my wife from burning out when they got to elementary school age they needed maximal bad time and and that led to this interesting reappraisal of my own work it helped really influence slow productivity where I was really thinking okay I need to stretch out what I'm doing maybe I'm have a peak right now of my capabilities but I got to slow down the pace at which I'm doing this because this is the time in like my kids lives where they need as much as me as possible so there's a lot of slow productivity there was a reaction to my kids getting to a certain age we'll be right back what's up revisit AI on your deep questions podcast you recently spoke about Ai and productivity and how to get ahead While others panic I love that how to get ahead While others Panic you mentioned that a pressing question about AI is the following when will AI be able to empty my inbox on my behalf say more yeah I mean I think that's a good stand in for the crucial future development to watch in AI uh this came out of a New Yorker piece I published a couple months ago that was looking at planning in Ai and I'm I'm increasingly coming to this point of view is that we have too much emphasis right now on language models I think this idea that the right way to increase the reasoning capability of artificial intelligence is to build larger and larger language models and just hope that the uh emergent reasoning properties that come out of trying to do token prediction effectively like this is the right way to build reasoning I don't think that's going to be the future of AI I think the future of AI is going to be much more streamlined language models that are good with language but that we are going to more and more explicitly externalize reasoning and cognition into separate models right so let's go to this example of emptying my inbox a large language model can never do this I I don't care how many parameters you put into gp4 it is not going to be able to empty my my inbox because in particular that requires future planning you have to actually simulate possible Futures based on the the novel input that you're you're looking at right now not something that you pre-trained on static feed forward models can't do this on the other hand if we look at a model like Cicero the model that was developed at meta that plays the board game diplomacy and plays that game really well the way that AI system works is that it has a language model to interact directly with the human players but a future simulation reasoning engine to simulate the possible moves to try to much more explicitly understand okay what's the right thing to do here uh it has an actual explicit theory of Mind here is the other players well if this player secretly thinks this even though they're telling me this then would it make sense to make this move or could they betray me in a way that's going to hurt my positioning in the board what if this player really thinks this and it actually explicitly thinks through future scenarios with explicit theories of Minds for the other people involved and then when the planning engine figures out what makes sense it tells the language model all right go say this to the other people in whatever way is natural for this game that's the type of system that can empty our inbox right so I'm I'm increasingly convinced that's the future AI play we see this in the move towards agent systems um I think we underplay how hard it is to build these agent systems we've sort of come back full circle like 1950s Dartmouth College original conference on AI that in the end we're going to end up having to build explicit reasoning systems that correspond and collaborate with the language models and those are going to be really hard and they're going to be bespoke and we're sort of back to where we started in some sense except for now we have language models to attack so I'm sort of developing this theory of AI where uh the totality of language models is a dead end it's going to be language models plus explicit other types of models the ensembles of these is really I think going to be the future of more useful AI what do you mean by Ensemble well so you might have a language model to talk to other humans and to take what they said and and translate it into language so other models can understand you might have a future simulation model to try to simulate the impact of various decisions to help plan what might makes sense you might have a goal model the whole thing there is to try to look at possibilities and help tell the planning engine what is aligning with what we're trying to do here or not you might have a world State model language models are static they can't do this but you could have an explicit World State model that evolves its understanding of what's happening in the world around it who people are what they believe or what's going on in the physical space and all these models can work together to create something like a functional artificial intelligence that's is what I think is going to give us artificial intelligence agents that are going to be uh much more like the the how 9000 right the the the it's something that reasons and thinks and acts and plans Ensemble models I think is the future we also see this move within industry I mean open AI hired away from meta the engineer noan Brown who was the the leader of this project to build that Ensemble model that won at diplomacy and noan Brown's big thing his big claim to fame was that he earlier built the first AI system that could beat professional poker players at No Limit texit Holden poker and his real innovation in that was figuring out how to simulate future moves that had a theory of Mind open AI hired them away probably to run their qar initiative which almost certainly is a major initiative to add more explicit planning engines into their AI product so I think this is really the direction AI is going even though right now all the focus is just on the language models themselves so you're right at the intersection of technology and sort of HR culture within the organization do you think the promise of AI where the performance is going to live up to the promise do you think it's do you think it's underhyped overhyped where and where do you see it having the most impact on cultures I think there's going to be areas where there's really big impact where there's uh activities that can be largely automated um I'm trying to carefully track the potential impact of AI on administrative overhead this is a big part of my thinking about digital knowledge work is the degree to which the humans have to keep switching our attention back and forth between many different administrative overhead tasks so emails and chats and meetings and forms and so I'm interested in what the impact of AI is going to have there because there is an optimistic scenario in which it could take a significant amount of that off the plate of the average knowledge worker that would be a huge impact right I think we underestimate the degree to which we are reducing the cognitive productive capacity of knowledge workers by forcing them to be in this this continual state of constantly switching our attention back and forth to servicing all these different administrative tasks so if you could offload that that could be a major productivity Boon and I mean productivity in the economic macro sense of just looking at the whole sector itself and dollars produced per worker in the sector that could be a huge Boon on the other hand I've been arguing for a long time we could get those same advantages by just changing the way we actually organize work we don't actually have to have a computer program take over our email we could just reorganize work so that we don't have to check email once every 5 minutes I mean I think there's more proximate solutions that require less of a breakthrough uh but they do these Solutions this this rethinking of how we do knowledge work is is really difficult there's a lot of friction there so maybe it is going to have to be an AI breakthrough that gets there but that's what I'm looking at the uh it's a metaphor but also reality AI emptying my inbox could be a substantial transformation of the experience of sort of uh creative or non-entry level knowledge work so we're both academics I've been predicting the disruption in higher ed for a good decade and thus far I've been wrong where do you think AI or disruption is with respect to higher ed yeah I mean a lot of people have predicted the disruption of higher ed um and there's you know there's two ways to see it I go back and forth right I mean so one way to see it is we've been teaching the same way basically a human in front of other humans in a room facing them for 500 years that means by God we really have to change or you could flip that around and say by God there must be something very fundamental about this mode of instruction if it has survived 500 years I mean the biggest possible disruption the higher ed was the Codex all right so we have a way of taking the knowledge of the very best thinkers on a particular topic and putting it into a portable indexable completely accessible type of artifact that can then be widely distributed I mean if anything was going to undermine the model of people Gathering and looking at someone out the front of the room it would have been the Codex and it and it didn't and so because of that I'm always a little bit skeptical about major transformation we thought Co was going to transform the academy because once we get used to being able to do things virtually why would we go back but it turns out people hated doing it virtually and we couldn't we couldn't wait to get back so when it comes to AI I'm watching carefully you know I'm on the task force at Georgetown for the pedagogical uses of AI I'm working on a big New Yorker piece right now about writing papers with AI so I'm sort of talking to students who do this trying to understand how students use it I think it's going to change things but I think potentially that change is going to be comparable to for example the arrival of the internet and Google which did change a lot of things right teachers had to adapt you could Now look up information very quickly that Solutions the problem sets could be Googled and and they could find them it might end up being something comparable to that certain types of classes we have to move more evaluation to in class when it comes to writing related classes we're going to have to get a little bit more explicit about the role of AI in that writing and sort of teach the process of where to integrate it or where not to integrate it you know it's possible that it's the next Google which was a big disruption for higher ed but it didn't make higher ed for example unrecognizable to someone who was around preg Google so you know I would give that the sort of middle percentile the middle cortile possibilities would be that for anybody who thinks okay I recognize AI is going to be big or H how would you suggest that somebody starting from almost zero get somewhat AI capable it's a hard question I've been thinking about this recently it's a hard question because what that means is changing right right now becoming AI capable essentially means become a good prompt engineer for a current generation of chatbot based interfaces to language models I don't know if that is what being AI capable two years from now like once AI actually has some economic traction and is really having some real impact on the way we run our economy I don't know that prompt engineering to gp4 is going to be all that relevant I think this is the type of thing that's going to be improved on on the other end of it so I think a watchful waiting right now is not uh is not uh in cautious right okay what's going on with language maybe I'll keep an eye on it but I don't know if I think it's urgent right now for everyone to for example be aggressively experimenting with chat interfaces to language models because I just don't know if that is going to be the the first major footprint that these tools are going to have on the economic the economic world so I mean it makes sense to keep up with it but I just think when the tools have the big impact we've seen this before I mean I study a lot the impacts of Technology on economics and and Business Systems right the tools that often have the real sort of tsunami effect like completely changed the way business is done overnight tend to be incredibly easy to pick up I think email is a great example this you didn't have to train on email or keep up with what was going on with email and you know the pine email systems in 1980s universities when they turned on email at your office like this makes sense I type in the name and I hit send right and it completely transformed work Google was similar once it was out there it was very very easy to learn how to use you just sort of type in what you're looking for oh my God it finds it this is really great right so we've seen this historically that often when tools come through that transform business in this really big way they're not that hard to pick up and so we don't yet know what the first major form factor of AI is going to be that's going to have really large impact again I'm not sure that it's chat interface to language model so keep an eye on it but you know I'm not going to Advocate right now that we need to be teaching prompt engineering to school students I think that's that's just going to be out of date too quickly so just as we wrap up here what would what would the advice be to your 25-year-old self you I almost feel like it's you're you're so far ahead of the game and you seem so guided and focused from such a young age what would you edit or add more or less color to what advice your 25y old self yeah one of the things I actually I wrote about this when I left grad school and I said what what did I wish I had done earlier so you know I left grad school whatever 28 and the the big thing I I look back and said I wish I had done is when I had first entered grad school talk to the students who were leaving like the students who had just graduated and in particular the students who were getting the the really interesting professorships and really interview them about like what matters how do you succeed in this because I felt like from an academic perspective I wandered too much in grad school in other words I I I worked on problems I thought were interesting I sort of invented problems and solved them and I published a lot of papers but when it came time to enter the academic job market it's not like I had a huge head of steam I wasn't on uh the hottest topics I wasn't doing the work that was really moving the scale and I remember thinking man I should have actually figured out at the beginning how do you succeed in this right and because I was at MIT and I I still could succeed in it but I wasn't you know coming out of there at the level I could be and so that was my my advice to like the 22y old Cal would be talk to the 28- year olds who are just graduating and find out what really matters when you go on the job market like what what's going to make you successful versus not and then starting right now aim for that so I think I I probably wandered more than I needed to in grad school yeah we we always talk about the import an of U of A kitchen cabinet um Cal Newport is a professor of computer science at Georgetown University where he's also a founding member of the center for digital ethics he is the author of eight books including a world without email digital minimalism and deep work which have sold millions of copies and been translated into over 40 languages Professor Newport is also contributor to the New Yorker and host the Deep questions podcast his latest book slow productivity the Lost of accomplishment without burnout is out now he joins us from his home just outside of our nation's great Capital Cal I've been a big fan for a while you're just such a an impressive young man and uh your books really have you you bring this sort of I don't know this you you thread the needle between substance and what I'll call retail your your stuff is very popular and yet it has that kind of academic heft anyways congratulations on all your success yeah well thank you Scott I enjoy talking [Music]
