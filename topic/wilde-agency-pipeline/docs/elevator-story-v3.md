# Elevator Story v3

Clarifying the two offerings and refining the language.

---

## Two Distinct Things

### 1. Wilde Agency (Venture Studio)
**What:** We build software products using our protocol
**Insight:** Platform × Experience × AI, compounded over 30 years
**For:** Founders who want to build on compound advantage

### 2. Protocol (SaaS)
**What:** A service for holding protocols and tools for managing knowledge and execution
**Insight:** We run our protocols on it. You can run yours.
**For:** Anyone who wants to systematize their knowledge and execution

These are related but different pitches.

## Wilde Agency Elevator Refinement

### The Core Story Elements
1. **Problem:** Software gets complex. AI makes it faster but not easier. Shortcuts compound into friction.
2. **Insight:** Good decisions compound too. We've been stacking them for 30 years.
3. **Solution:** A protocol—platform × experience × AI—that we use to build ventures.
4. **For you:** Rare projects get to build on it. Compound advantage from day one.

### Attempt 1: The Compound
> "Software decisions compound. Good ones make everything easier. Bad ones haunt you forever.
>
> We've spent 30 years compounding good decisions into a protocol. Platform. Experience. AI. Multiplied together.
>
> We use it to build our ventures. The right outside projects get to build on it too."

### Attempt 2: The Friction Killer
> "Every software project starts fast. Then friction creeps in. Complexity. Backtracking. The shortcuts catch up.
>
> We built a protocol that prevents that. Thirty years of optimized decisions—baked in before you write a line of code.
>
> We build ventures on it. Occasionally, we invite someone else to."

### Attempt 3: The Multiplier Effect
> "AI made everyone faster. Experience is still rare. But the real edge is when you multiply them—on a platform built to compound.
>
> That's what we did. Platform × Experience × AI. Three decades of good decisions, ready to run.
>
> We launch ventures on it. Sometimes we let the right project join."

### Attempt 4: The Honest One
> "We're a venture studio. We build software products for ourselves.
>
> To do that well, we built a protocol—platform, 30 years of patterns, AI-optimized flow. It's how we move fast without breaking things.
>
> Occasionally we take on an outside project. When we do, you're not hiring an agency. You're running on the same protocol we trust with our own bets."

### Attempt 5: The Short Sharp One
> "Thirty years of engineering decisions. Compounded into a protocol. Platform × Experience × AI.
>
> We use it to build ventures fast. Rare projects get access.
>
> That's Wilde Agency."

## Protocol SaaS Elevator Refinement

### The Core Story Elements
1. **Problem:** Knowledge is scattered. Execution is inconsistent. Teams reinvent instead of compound.
2. **Insight:** Protocols turn knowledge into repeatable execution. But you need somewhere to hold them.
3. **Solution:** A service for protocols—store, manage, execute. We run ours on it.
4. **For you:** Run your protocols on it too. Systematize what you know.

### Attempt 1: The Knowledge Compound
> "Knowledge compounds—but only if you capture it.
>
> Protocol is where you hold what you know and how you execute. Not docs that rot. Living protocols that run.
>
> We built it to run our venture studio. Now you can run yours on it too."

### Attempt 2: The Execution Layer
> "Everyone has docs. Nobody reads them. Knowledge dies in wikis.
>
> Protocol is different. It holds your knowledge AND your execution. Living protocols, not dead documentation.
>
> We run our venture studio on it. You can run your operation on it."

### Attempt 3: The Operating System
> "What if your best decisions were captured, ready to run again?
>
> Protocol is an operating system for knowledge and execution. Hold your protocols. Manage your playbooks. Systematize what works.
>
> We run Wilde Agency on it. Builders and operators can run theirs on it too."

### Attempt 4: The Simple One
> "Your protocols. Your playbooks. Your knowledge. One place to hold it all and actually use it.
>
> We built Protocol to run our venture studio. It works.
>
> Now it's open. Run yours on it."

### Attempt 5: The Compound Positioning
> "We run a venture studio. To do it well, we needed somewhere to hold our protocols—how we build, how we decide, how we execute.
>
> So we built Protocol. Knowledge and execution, systematized.
>
> We run ours on it. You can run yours."

## Connecting The Two

The relationship:

```
Protocol (SaaS)
    └── powers → Wilde Agency (Venture Studio)
                     └── builds on → The Platform (Codebase)
```

**Story link:**
> "Wilde Agency runs on Protocol—our system for holding knowledge and execution. The ventures we build run on our Platform—30 years of engineering, compounded. Together: Experience × AI, systematized and ready to deploy."

## Tagline Options

### For Wilde Agency
| Option | Feel |
|--------|------|
| "Experience × AI" | Core formula |
| "30 years, compounded" | Accumulated advantage |
| "Not an agency—a protocol" | Differentiator |
| "Compound advantage, day one" | What you get |
| "The venture studio that builds on its own bets" | Trust/alignment |

### For Protocol SaaS
| Option | Feel |
|--------|------|
| "Where protocols live" | Simple, clear |
| "Knowledge that runs" | Active, not static |
| "Your operating system for execution" | Bold claim |
| "We run ours on it. You can run yours." | Trust through use |
| "Systematize what works" | Outcome |

## Testing: The Cocktail Party Version

**Someone asks: "What do you do?"**

### Wilde Agency (Short)
> "I run a venture studio. We build software products on a protocol we've refined for 30 years—platform, experience, AI all compounded together. Occasionally we build with outside founders who want that same advantage."

### Wilde Agency (Punchy)
> "We build software for ourselves—fast, because we spent 30 years making the hard parts easy. Sometimes we let the right founder build with us."

### Protocol SaaS (Short)
> "I built a service for holding protocols—how teams capture knowledge and systematize execution. We run our venture studio on it. Now it's open for others."

### Protocol SaaS (Punchy)
> "A home for your protocols. We run ours on it. You can run yours."

## What's Still Missing?

The wording is getting closer. What's not clicking yet?

- Too abstract?
- Not enough pain/problem?
- Missing a specific image or metaphor?
- Need more "this is me" trigger?

Let me know what to push on.
