Mapping LAPS framework to Wilde Agency reality. Identify gaps, adaptations, and actions.

---

## Pipeline Overview

| Stage | Daniel's Model | Wilde Agency Adaptation | Status | Priority |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|--------|----------|
| **L - Leads** | Short-form → Long-form → Signal | Ads + Long-form → Calculator/Assessment | Needs work | HIGH |
| **A - Appointments** | Immediate follow-up, hook pitch | Same, but scriptable for delegation | Needs work | HIGH |
| **P - Presentations** | 10-component framework | Same framework, needs Wilde-specific content | Partial | MEDIUM |
| **S - Sales** | Close + 7-touch follow-up | Same, needs scripts for delegation | Needs work | HIGH |

---

## Stage 1: LEADS

### Daniel's Model
```
Short-form content (daily) → Long-form content (4 pieces) → Signal of Interest form
```

### Wilde Agency Adaptation
```
Paid Ads + Organic → Long-form content (4 pieces) → Qualifying Calculator
                                                          ↓
                                                    Exposes problem
                                                    Delivers value
                                                    Captures lead
```

### What Exists
- [ ] 4 long-form content pieces
- [ ] Qualifying calculator
- [ ] Landing page
- [ ] Ad campaigns

### What's Needed

**Long-Form Content (4 cornerstone pieces)**
| # | Topic | Format | Status | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Technical architecture philosophy | Blog/Video | Not started | "Why foundation-first beats build-from-scratch" |
| 2 | Startup-to-scale journey | Case study | Not started | Real client transformation story |
| 3 | Fractional CTO value prop | Guide | Not started | "When you need a CTO but can't afford one" |
| 4 | Client success compilation | Video/PDF | Not started | Testimonials + outcomes |

**Qualifying Calculator Concept**
- Name idea: "Startup Technical Readiness Score" or "Build vs Buy Calculator"
- Input: Questions about their situation
- Output: Score + personalized insights + problem exposure
- Goal: Qualify lead AND demonstrate expertise simultaneously

Calculator questions to explore:
1. Current technical state (none / MVP / scaling / legacy)
2. Team composition (solo founder / have devs / have CTO)
3. Timeline pressure (yesterday / 3 months / exploring)
4. Budget reality (bootstrap / seed / series A+)
5. Core challenge (speed to market / scaling / leadership)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Design calculator flow and scoring
- [ ] Build landing page with calculator
- [ ] Create 4 long-form content pieces
- [ ] Set up ad campaigns pointing to landing page

---

## Stage 2: APPOINTMENTS

### Daniel's Model
- Immediate follow-up on lead capture
- 4-step outreach: Relevance → Permission → Hook Pitch → Request
- Hook pitch: Name-Same-Fame-Pain-Aim-Game

### Wilde Agency Adaptation
- Same model works
- **Need: Scriptable for delegation**
- Someone else should be able to book appointments using a script

### What Exists
- [x] Hook pitch framework (in protocol)
- [x] Email templates (basic)
- [ ] Phone script
- [ ] Delegation-ready documentation

### Current Hook Pitch (needs refinement)
```
Name: "I'm Dathan from Wilde Agency"
Same: "We're a software development consultancy"
Fame: "30+ years experience, refined codebase that skips months of setup"
Pain: "Most startups waste their first 6 months on scaffolding instead of product"
Aim: "We help teams launch production-ready software in weeks, not months"
Game: "Our vision is to make enterprise-quality engineering accessible to startups"
```

### Refinement Questions
- Is "Same" clear enough? What's the familiar reference point?
- Is "Fame" compelling? What proof points hit hardest?
- Is "Pain" specific to ideal client?
- Does the 30-45 second version flow naturally?

**Actions:**
- [ ] Refine hook pitch with specific proof points
- [ ] Create phone script for appointment booking
- [ ] Create delegation playbook (so others can do this)
- [ ] Define response SLA (e.g., <5 min during business hours)

## Stage 3: PRESENTATIONS

### Daniel's Model
10 components:
1. Framing
2. Rapport
3. Permission to process
4. Present Situation (listen)
5. Prize/Desired Outcome (listen)
6. Problem/Obstacles (listen)
7. Insights (speak)
8. Method (speak)
9. Solution (speak)
10. Discussion

### Wilde Agency Status
- [x] Framework documented
- [x] Discovery questions drafted
- [x] Golf bag started (5 insights, 3 methods)
- [ ] Visual aids (brochure/deck)
- [ ] Tiered offer one-pager
- [ ] Presentation script for delegation

### What's Needed

**Visual Aids**
- [ ] Branded Zoom background
- [ ] One-page offer overview (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- [ ] Case study slide deck
- [ ] Architecture diagram showing "foundation-first" approach

**Golf Bag Expansion** (from Hormozi content?)
Current insights are good but could use:
- More data/research backing
- Specific client story examples
- Clearer "aha moment" framing

**Actions:**
- [ ] Create visual one-pager for offer tiers
- [ ] Build simple slide deck for presentations
- [ ] Extract more insights from Hormozi content
- [ ] Record sample presentation for training

---

## Stage 4: SALES (Close + Follow-up)

### Daniel's Model
- Complete sale immediately if ready
- If not ready: specific follow-up scheduled
- 7+ touch follow-up sequence
- Nurture sequence for long-term
- Reactivation campaign

### Wilde Agency Status
- [x] Follow-up cadence documented
- [x] Reactivation email template
- [ ] Closing script
- [ ] Objection handling scripts
- [ ] Proposal template
- [ ] Contract template

### What's Needed

**Closing Scripts**
Need scripted responses for:
- "I need to think about it"
- "I need to check with my partner/board"
- "It's more than I expected"
- "Can you do it for less?"
- "What's the timeline?"
- "How is this different from [competitor/alternative]?"

**Delegation Requirements**
For someone else to close:
- [ ] Objection handling playbook
- [ ] Pricing authority guidelines (what discounts can they offer?)
- [ ] Proposal generation process
- [ ] Handoff protocol (when to escalate to Dathan)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Write closing scripts for common scenarios
- [ ] Create objection handling playbook
- [ ] Build proposal template
- [ ] Define delegation boundaries

## Knowledge Gaps to Fill

Content to extract from Hormozi videos:
- [ ] Offer creation framework → Refine Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers
- [ ] Value equation → Strengthen pitch
- [ ] Objection handling → Close scripts
- [ ] Pricing psychology → Confidence in pricing conversations
- [ ] LTV optimization → Post-sale protocols (future)

---

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Calculator**: What's the "aha" output that exposes the problem?
2. **Pitch**: What "Fame" proof point is most compelling?
3. **Closing**: What's the biggest objection you hear?
4. **Delegation**: Who would do appointment booking? Close deals?
5. **Pricing**: Any flexibility in tiers, or are they fixed?
