hey what's up guys before we get started I have a very special announcement to make that has been years in the making we have officially launched the waight list for our brand new book it's called software as a science and you can get Early Access and become a part of the launch community by going to software book.com it's completely free to sign up you might even get early access to the book and you become a part of the launch community where we're giving away tons of bonus content and mobilizing all of you to help us share the news of the book with the rest of the world this has over 10 years of software experience our best work from coaching thousands of Founders all packed into a single book that i' love to give you early access to so go to software.com and get your copy today we're chilling on the eighth floor of in downtown Denver overlooking K field after our two-day boardroom event first course field is where sports sports sports ball I was wondering uh where they got the name from and I realized somebody paid them the most someone combined Sports and beer so just a guarantee Dan knows nothing about any of it yeah both of those there we go what city are we in uh anyways we just wrapped up our first it was the first borom event post transition yeah you being CEO yeah and uh we decided we' talk about how that went that we could talk about that well no we don't have to talk I mean I I don't want to hijack the conversation I think what would be most useful to people and I think that's what we agreed upon earlier is talking about how to run a customer conference because if you are a SAS founder specifically and you've not brought your customers together huge Roi like huge Roi massive yep and and we just execute that Playbook doing this what's unique about this one is I wasn't involved at all as in like I just came to do a talk and that was it mhm which is kind of crazy for a guy that built a coaching company that was his face and so and and it's actually an interesting question that I think somebody asked me yesterday they said how many other coaching companies do you know that the founder started it owns it still but is no longer involved in it I don't know of anyone if you count jym launch they own a minority maybe NOP majority ownership majority ownership I got nothing fascinating yeah sweet Uncharted Go Johnny and go Matt yeah sh team dude it's been it's been really interesting I think the the the extraction to make there is there's a there's a Playbook there's a process through hundreds of events have distilled essentially the the the magic is creating the container for great relationships to happen like PE no one buys Community but that's the thing that we're delivering here the what gets the clients on an epic high and becomes an incredible wind at your back as the business of your S soft uh software founder pH Post Yeah if you're a software founder wondering about the upside that a client event could bring it is the fact that the community starts doing a whole lot of heavy lifting for you it's about the on the front door the way in it's about the product the features so for us a lot of times it's the content it's the speaker it's the experiences that's the thing that gets them there and then the thing that keeps them coming back are the relationships that they form and the the all that can come out of that is pretty exciting I I think that like when I think of groups I've I've joined many masterminds and gone to many events back in the day and it's like I paid to go first off I want to learn something that's going to make me money so I have to believe that some piece of the content some kind of conversation some kind of aspect of what I'm about to go pay for is going to Roi the time and money investment then on the back end of that what makes the experience feel good because again we don't remember what we're taught we remember how we felt is doing things that otherwise we probably wouldn't do for ourselves and that's actually an interesting component of some of the best events I've ever been to I mean I think one of the best events and Matt you've been to one is as Mastermind talks mmt and they spend you know Jason spends a year planning this one event so when you unpack what he does and how he creates these Transitions and experiences and these uh these opportunities for people to bond on a deeper level not surface and and reduce you know take the mask down I think that's that's what's super special and so for us to take you know a very um detailed SAS Focus the best of the best Revenue customer success you know scaling revops all you know uh marketing demand gen all of that and pair that with the kind of the emotional connection relationship side that's what makes this one of the best events in the world for any software CEO period hands down it's the best even if you weren't a software CEO and you somehow snuck your way in the room yeah still learned some stuff oh my gosh you be like uh why doesn't my YPO Forum do this why doesn't my group do this like it's crazy the amount of clients we have that are YPO members that are EO members that are part of tiger like other groups M and they come to these events and they're like oh yeah this is a different level yeah yeah and I think what's interesting for software Founders thinking this especially if they're earlier stage they might be like oh these events cost so much money this and this and that Revenue generating we'll teach them yeah but it makes you money also there is so much magic you can create and Jason stuff is a good example there's a lot of details that you can Implement that don't cost anything that will change the way the event goes like for instance something I learned from Jason is about deliber L curating the tables and who you're sitting next to like architecting and imagining what are the conversations that Johnny and Dan might have so I should put those guys near each other like that costs zero dollars a little bit of time and intentionality there's a lot that goes into making the magic show up 100% so let's let's put the big ingredients in first and then we'll go to the seasoning at the end what makes a great event so if you by the end of this you can leave with a checklist of like if I'm going to go produce a customer event what should I be focusing on first what do you think the the big component is to nail I I think the big I always start backwards with what's the biggest what's the biggest fear somebody's gonna have for not doing it first off let's talk about filling it up so the best way it sounds crazy to fill up a customer conference is to add the event registration and promotion in the sign up process and flow of your software okay like right off the bat if somebody's signing up for your product soon as they become a customer or it's a sales call at the end of the like they bought you say by the way next April we have a customer conference right now we have an early bird opportunity for you to purchase tickets for you and your team at Half Price did you want me to add that onto the deal in the signup flow literally an interstitial I'm signed up I go through the onboarding PS promotion hey we got our event in the next two months did you want to sign up you and your team for the event add it to the cart check check like people don't realize they have attention at that stage to fill up the event the other one I would say is and we'll talk about about sponsors but also having the sponsors promote it to their customer base right maybe it's not people that are currently customers but if you have a customer conference sometimes bringing people that are in the industry I mean look at uh dreamforce or look at inbound like you want to you have the potential that's a big big you know thing but you have the potential to also St uh create the conference for your yeah your industry your sector yeah I don't even think like it's it's fun and interesting to look and draw inspiration from those big events but you can have an incredible event with 50 people at it and virtual yeah and and or virtual yeah we've had a lot of our clients do virtual customer conferences and it produces a lot of the benefits right that we'll talk about like testimonial videos and you know really empowering our purple customers that are raving fans to to essentially teach our other customers how they're using our software you can do all that in a virtual structure so the the orchestration can be in person or online but they work technically the same yeah yeah so I wouldn't make it about your products like inbound is not about HubSpot it's about inbound marketing no so it's about the problem they're trying to solve yeah get a nucleus of your clients and then allow them to invite friends allow your partners to invite people to that so now that becomes an opportunity for your clients to connect but also to bring in new business yep although that's not the right I I'll just say like there is a element to the attention you need to keep in mind is the curation of the room y you want there to be shared experiences if you go too broad you make it too salesy it actually dilutes the client experience so keeping the two in mind I want there to be sales opportunities but at the end of the you have to just decide what are we designing for does this need to produce revenue does it need to produce client connections am I trying to engine this for increasing client LTV so I'm actually charging for it do I use this as a conduit to bring in sponsorships so I get people who could potentially be Affiliates or just be another Revenue stream into the business so it's important to think what are we designing the event for and what problem is it solving y but it's interesting I think like okay so it up just by our existing audience yeah and then people go to cost it sounds like it's going to cost money I think you either look at it from a marketing budget if you do things because like what's it going to cost you to reach out to customers and get testimonial videos well if you bring them together and you get those videos on site they come to you you get a bunch of testimonial videos it helps with the sales process there's your Roi yeah or you know is there one or two sponsors that would love to get in front of our audience maybe it's Partners like we already have Professional Services Downstream partners that do a lot of the integration work for our software they'll pay to help with the the overhead cost yeah and I mean that's the the part that I find fascinating is if you look at two or three sponsors to like cover ever your room cost and maybe some food cost and then you look at the ROI of marketing collateral created yeah right testimonial case studies uh that kind of stuff you look at the opportunity to upsell that's my favorite I mean we used to do an event that the whole point of the event was to upsell people into the next thing yeah it's like then then you literally have okay here's the guest list here's the people that need to expand right expansion revenue and then you invite your customer success people or you tell the rest of the team and they you when you curate the dinner tables boom you you just happen to curate them with a customer that's using all your features with six of them that are only using one with the customer success person prompting questions yeah the ROI is like easy and and I'll let you guys decide where to sequence this in in the conversation but the next level on that too what we do internally we call 10-minute tactics but to zoom out for a minute just a way to feature those purple customers to let them explain the way that they're using all the different stuff which puts them in an authority position makes those other like serendipitous conversation even easier I think there a huge huge opportunity to do that well I just think like the idea of having your customers be the content most Founders don't even consider they think they need to teach they need to bring in speakers it's like nope you have customers that are doing great cool stuff they're probably notable amongst their peers and then what you do is you have this piece of content that could be repurposed for your podcast it could purpose for your YouTube it could repurpose for the sales Channel like I would even sit down at your sales team and say where what objections are we getting hit with and how do we structure the content to overcome the objection that also is value added for the people coming we were just talking about this uh this morning y it takes a little bit of thinking and it'll make the whole thing seem like almost like what what made us wait so long to do this every every founder that we've taught the customer conference strategy to afterwards go I wish would have done that two years ago yeah everyone yeah so true you'll uh you'll if you sat down and you said okay what would make this a 10 out of 10 for our sales team and you got the list from them you said okay what would make it a 10 out of 10 for our marketing team you got it case studies testimonials Etc would make it 10 out of 10 for my customer success team you can literally check every single box thei you can even bring the finance guy into the room he'll be in there eventually I promise yeah he wants it to be zero uh and so you can it's really interesting if you sit down and orchestrate the event the right way we can check all the boxes and out of it there's all of this intangible Roi as well that like at the end of the day we are human to human businesses right so we create the container there that allows us to have a a relationship that's a lot more than just a transaction with our clients them between each other um so it's it's hard to uh again that's just such a difficult thing to you articulate until you experience it and then when your clients do you become that's a really competitive Advantage yeah there's two two big ideas I've heard from you guys so far I to pull out for the people watching this the first one is like for the founders you can be very well spoken about the problem you solve but at the end of the day your customers would rather hear it from other customers compared to hearing it from you like they don't really want to hear it from you they want to see other people like them solving the problem so I think it's engineering for that is is really really beautiful um second point I had is gone so we'll continue you know does that really really well as Trevor over at carrot yeah like if you want to go see someone he he just shines a light he's a carrots a platform for Real Estate Investors one of our clients yep he just brings in some of the most successful Real Estate Investors that are also customers of his product yeah but he just they Shine the Light so you're Shine the Light in your dream customers which has this upward pull so anyone that comes is like going to think Man carrot is a key ingredient of that or I'm using carrot but I don't use it like that and so this is huge upward Force but just shining a light on those clients and they're saying great things about your product and teaching the how because our our our products only expedite a workflow so if the workflow is shitty they're just going to produce shitty work faster so it's like if you are serving Real Estate Investors you're going to want them to think have the mindsets and the behaviors of your most successful clients that will then translate to them being a more successful client for you but just think of what you guys just said which is so powerful in customers don't want to hear from the the creators of the software how cool it is they want to hear from other people that are just like them so if I'm a coach or I'm a in the dental industry I'm a whatever and I use this CRM software and there's a speaker that's that that is a dental practice or a coach using a Salesforce or using a marketing tool or whatever that's the session I'm most excited about and the coolest part is that person now becomes a champion for all the customers you have and they'll share the best practices takes the load off your support team takes a load off your customer success team makes the person feel good about their skills because most people underestimate what they know so they feel great because they're getting approach after their talk they're building relationships they're you know and sometimes you see big companies who user groups and those people lead those things I just think it's such an Roi positive use of your time that again if you're listening to this and you've thought about it just go just do the virtual one for now like do a zoom session invite 25 customers have them present for you can do an afternoon event it doesn't have to be a full day or multi-day it could literally be a 4our event on a Friday afternoon Call It Whatever comp make it a thing and if you like it do more of it and if you don't don't but I mean it's better than just sitting around but the glue that you create like the community from it that's the intangible when you have when you have raving fans and raving fans are completely different than just like people that are happy with your software raving fans will get you into distribution opportunities they'll get you on podcasts you could have never got on they'll get you featured in magazines they'll these are the people where they change jobs and they fight to get your software in the company that that you don't get that if they're just a user you get that if they're a raving fan yeah I'll say We've ran quite a few virtual and in person virtual can help you get your feet wet but you have to do in person to catch the magic like you can it can be a mix you're strategy can eventually have some there's a lot that you can do in a virtual setting that you can't do in person but there is so much of the upside that only happens when you're in person it's how you you you compete the differentiation between anyone else in your category is bringing people who are hiding behind keyboards and zoom and get them in person and they don't have to be big people like picture these you know banquet halls like like Trevor runs carrot Camp the guy we're talking about earlier Trevor from car runs carrot camp and they're small in-person Gatherings they're intimate they do you know some customers go in and they present they teach they do a little activity they rock and roll and it's small and it's tight and it's killer yeah I've seen some of our customers do customer conferences at their customers offices that's cool oh that's cool yeah so that way they don't have to pay for the space and the customer doesn't mind hosting because they got this space that they use for their Auditorium or whatever you know so it's like you don't need people are like oh I I looked at hotels and it's going to cost X Y and Z it's like no it doesn't yeah just get creative about it figure out what makes it a win-win yeah yeah who runs it on your team if you're a Founder you're like all right maybe I should who if your team's pretty small you're assistant yeah yeah as Dan glances over oh trust me this is a today conversation she's like who's running this and I'm like I know um but I mean usually customer success I think if you had to pick unless you had a dedicated team member I mean yeah you can get pretty Scrappy I'll just say like uh go talk to several events go find who else has done this talk to them and ask them who on their team did it and you start to you can man you can run it with a pretty small team we had a we had a part-time uh event you can hire event contractors to do one-off events I mean it's just like a wedding planner literally a wedding planner probably could help you especially if it's offseason like if you're doing your event in September October where there's not as many weddings a wedding planner would be plenty of horsepower yeah that's a great point I forgot we did use a fractional team for two years we Ed a part-time maybe even longer yeah yeah I think one thing too if you're talking to other Founders about how to do this like you have another company who's done it before make sure you use the magic words when you were my size how did you do it yeah right you you got yeah if you got somebody who's running a thousand person event you'll get a sick Playbook that you can't run and can't afford to run yeah you know I don't know if we have many clients that have done one and not done it again I think that's accurate like everyone that's added one they continue to do it because it continues to be profitable and D if you do one a year that's not that big and it and it also this is the other thing is you look at Apple you look at you know Salesforce or inbound it also creates a forcing function for the Cadence of your product releases and I think people underestimate that like knowing the whole team that that Roi of that as you know John it's like okay this is the date we got to get the features done I'm going on stage I'm demoing can we please hold rally around this so I mean that Roi just having a forcing function that is a date where we know everybody's going to have eyes on this thing yes is pretty powerful as well I that it was wild yeah on adoption yep how much harder is it you work really hard let's say you don't have the customer event you release the product and then your whole customer Su success team works for months to go drive adoption versus when we get them all into the room they're all hyped up way farther down that yeah than we than we would without it so um how how could let's we can go one of two ways what's it look like to do this wrong so common mistakes over I mean I think we go that route we could also do uh Place additional places to draw inspiration from I love to hear like the events that we've been to yeah I mean I think the wrong is the opposite of what we recommended I think that there's there's more we could talk about uh orchestration wise yeah I think the how would be really important for I would just say like I think there's a real tendency to over complicate when you benchmark against Stream force or or inbounds you get way out over your skis ahead of time so the way to kill you doing events is to way over commit like we want minimum effective dose for V1 and let it snowball over time this absolutely H it's a fail prooof Playbook if you execute well it's not that the strategy might work or might not well let's say where sometimes people do it wrong the biggest one is too much content too much content leave some room to breathe the the clients want time 2hour lunch as an example yeah yeah like so they can get caught up on emails most people they run event they're like oh it's an hour lunch or it's 55 minutes and it's like that's not enough time when you have a lot of people trying to find a place to eat they meet some friends or talking they got to be back in an hour I'll tell you what's going to happen half the room is going to be empty yeah right oh man I would say doing an event in Vegas probably not a great [ __ ] move just throwing that one out there yeah don't want to be the first speaker on the second day of an event in Vegas yeah there's nobody in the room I refuse to do it these are like little things in my speaking contract I will not do that to distractions I went to costs like there's certainly cities that cost a shitload more than others so like don't go pick the you know hosting an event in New York City probably and hosting it in the city where most of your team is is probably a good idea because you can also have the benefit of like kind of an indirect team offsite oh yeah oh dude we use it as a part of our onboarding like when I want them to come and see the magic feel it in the customer so if you have an in office team hosted in the city that way it's actually fun for the clients cuz you know like trainual for examples down in Scottdale and it's like super fun to actually like go visit their office as part of their event so that you know you get to build a personal relationship you You' the the there's something about the geography of knowing the team because most people use software they probably can't even tell you where the team is let alone can tell you the CEO is so to be able to say like I met the CEO I've met some of the people on the team and I've been to their office or at least the city or the neighborhood that's kind of cool yeah one of the best filters I heard for this to prer thinking about what to put into an event was actually from Takis program he said when you're running an in-person event don't fill it up with things that you could get by not being at an inperson event so good yeah do do things that you could only do at an inperson event for example for example dinners 2hour lunches breakout sessions experiences all of the things that get face Toof face interpersonal relationships built so it's not we're not saying don't do any talks or any content but don't index super heavy on that yeah like like you can start the event at 10:00 a.m. go to 12:30 2 hour lunch hour and a half lunch finish a little early have an Afterparty sponsored by somebody the best people like locally sponsors I get sponsors all the time um is the wealth management people just for what it's worth like they're easy ones to hit up uh lawyers you know Banks again anybody that's helping businesses or people with like kind of broad personal stuff yeah they they are like they can't find enough events to throw five or 10 grand to and and those are easy sponsors for like cocktail hours and stuff y but yeah keep it simple but at the same time I would say if you do get people together um try to figure out how to get some kind of activity and it could be a morning workout kind of thing group workout or super simple I mean like we've had just a trainer in the area come yep we have a trainer come lead a stretch do a run yeah shared experiences to your point on what you can't do online you I will say promotion wise content is the thing that gets people to sign up so you got to have a couple of like reasons why yeah it's it's the chocolate and we're going to teach you this really Advanced cool thing or we got this like killer talk or speaker or whatever so minimum effective dose for that would be an something exciting enough to get people to register and no more than that yeah and usually something's going to make the money or save them time yeah it's funny if you get the right caliber speaker it still fits the criteria I couldn't go listen to Dan Martell give me a keynote unless I go to that event so I'm going to go to that event yeah if people are not already deciding to pick a date like go pick a date M decide to do it maybe virtual first but in person is a lot of fun I think some I think when I think about the objections we've gotten from our clients some of them like well my clients they're only paying us 100 bucks a month they're not going to get on a plane to come visit us and I don't know i' i' I think you'd be surprised how many people are looking for a reason to get out of their office yeah well I think the reason someone gets on a plane has no relation to the annual contract value of the software they're buying it's are you running a event worth going to yeah or and just meeting other peers right if I'm a lawn care guy I want to meet other Lawn Care people and I don't know any if I run a transportation trucking company I might not know anybody else so I get to go an event where I can meet other people that use the software to do Trucking so you can even call that out as like different tracks where if you have five different verticals you serve say we're to do the afternoons or breakouts per vertical yeah that' be another thing that I would say is like go there's so much in the the curated room don't try like room yeah just Niche Niche down right you want to be able to give the client the experience of oh my gosh I finally found my people the people who go to sleep worrying about the things I worry about every night yeah yeah uh if you get too broad then they have to fish through a bunch and they feel like a number so yeah don't make don't put the work on the audience the people attending yeah yeah do the curation yeah I think one of the things one of our like mantras from our own internal events team they say create magical moments you know and I think that it doesn't matter if you have an events team or you're like what is an offense team or it's you and an assistant or whatever it's just any human beings on your team don't make the client work right they're there they've showed up they put the time in they spent time away from their families like don't Point them to the bathroom walk them to the bathroom don't say your tables over there take them to the table Yeah notice the water's empty exactly like notice the t-shirts aren't folded and fold them real quick whatever the thing is just take an exceptional amount of pride in everything you see in all of your interactions because you guys said it earlier right it's about how you make them feel so the way that the event makes them feel is part of it that's what it gets them there but the way we treat them at the event is really what gives them the Lasting Impression that'll make them want to stay your customer and keep coming back one of the most powerful things on that is teaching your team how to connect people so like so a lot of yeah I mean tell us you're Magic on dude you do this incredibly well it's so people are scared because they're like well I don't know anybody the cool part is you only need to know one m so just go up to a group of people and talk to one person it's like hey Johnny nice to meet you I'm Bob what do you do Johnny well I'm the CEO of this company oh cool where are you from blah blah blah blah blah that's all I need to know then I turn around I'm like hey I'm Bob and you're like I'm Matt I go hey B Matt do you know Johnny like no Johnny's from this city he's the CEO of this company you guys should connect you don't know that I don't know him well you think I really know him and and you don't even know why I'm introducing but you think well he's obviously making an introduction for a reason I do this at scale and it and it's it's actually I do it because sometimes when I'm on a schedule and I got to move I don't want to be rude so I do the intro to give myself space to kind of keep moving on my schedule but it's the thing that people always remember some folks are more introverted they're not willing to go up to a group of people that are strangers so you helping connect those people you'll then see them continue the conversation and then end up sitting down together end up going to lunch together and on the the second day of an event that's what they're homie yeah because you just just said hello and ask them where they're from and what they do and then just said oh do you know this person no I don't you know they don't know them yeah and you just make the intro the best compliment you can get is being called a router or a connector right it's like just it's not it's not that complicated people are like I don't know a lot of people I'm scared to ask a lot of questions or you know I get nervous it's like that's literally that I could do it real time right now that's the L hey man I'm Dan hey I'm Bob where you from what what do you do oh do you know Matt no I don't know Matt oh Matt's you know he's really cool you should get to know him and then you just walk away do you keep doing it yeah it's uh it's interesting there's so much to just creating just enough of the container for them to almost like you know paint inside the numbers so for examp example you don't have to teach something super complex we could just if from the stage you could run a training that says for example um you're trying to teach how to break down an ad you can just come up with three components of an ad have a blank worksheet that says I want you to brainstorm component number one and you've just given just enough scaffolding to for them to start painting ins other numbers that also happens in creating connection for example just place a prompt on the table the connect all we need to do is get the conversation started that's what you're talking about here so at scale orchestrating in the room for example you might get everyone together we kick off day one what are our intentions why did you come write them down all right stand up get into groups of three tell them that's it all we're trying to they're going to take it run with you have a hard time getting them to sit back down let's talk about the orchestration but I want to tell a funny just funny anecdote last night at dinner there was one of those prompts and the prompt was what's keeping you from being present right now and somebody wrote this question that was that's funny that is hilarious um but so we take for granted that we understand orchestration of energy in a room okay and that's why we run the best like like most people don't even know it's happening but we know it it's intentional we say all the time we own the energy in the room it's our responsibility so there's a lot of people have taught me different components of this over the years but you talked about one of them first off when you get people to do an exercise of share they all have to stand up yeah like there a different energy if people are sitting down to stand up and then you also tell them stand up use the whole room there's space over there there's space over there and and what that does is it just keeps the energy High because the worst thing you can be is in a room the other thing we do is keep the temperature down a little bit not to freeze them out although unfortunately sometimes hotels don't collaborate with us properly and we do that so bring a sweater um then but it's really even the orchestrations when I think of like a 60-minute time frame I want to figure out how to to do two to three orchestrations meaning do I get them to ponder a question write down turn to your neighbor share stand up group of people get together share uh share change the mic feedback post you know what I mean like and then takeaways shares Q&amp;A those are all separate orchestrations that you can use and the cool part to fill time that makes it about co-creating the content and not being you're you're you're throwing up on them just nonstop you don't want one way I say like I kick off every event there are no uh consumers we are creating this together you don't get to sit back in and I'm like you this is not you know Netflix live yeah you're here to participate and so we get them you know set in intention and then share with each other the other really cool thing is the we call it the Death Star which also makes for some really great yeah everybody should get one of these talk box is that what they're called Talk box right it's got a microphone in it it's like soft box we you know get them to to do an exercise maybe they're creating an ad maybe they're you know whatever doing takeways whatever it is and then you just ask who wants to share it'll take second be comfortable waiting and you can seed people that's yeah you could ask someone to do a head time or just get comfortable all you have to do is wait 7 Seconds it'll feel like an internity for you say hey who wants to go first and then just start counting SE within seven seconds someone will put for you yes they'll put it up you Chuck the talk box out they introduce themselves they share their takeaway and now we have this like fun the whole room's involved the first two will take a couple minutes we whipping this box around the room for the mic we may or may not have shattered a crystal chandelier in Toronto OH we've done everything we did it this morning where somebody hit a water pitcher and flooded the table yeah but I I when I'm on stage I always go furthest to point to point I'm like let's see how good your arm is and let's see how good you catch yeah you know and but the other thing and again I'm not sure if you uh there's deliberateness in this is always thank the person for the share y like really go out of your way and say to the person Bob that was a great share thank you CU then other people like I like that I want I want somebody to acknowledge me Yeah we actually we get the whole room to do it so another little hack is we'll say hey thanks Ryan for sharing and the whole room we count down we go three two one and one single clap for Ryan and then so it's just creating this and that one clap is so I mean there's some advanced stuff we do that's why we run the best events but we've hired the best people like literally we've hired the best people around event management and orchestration we've built those playbooks our event team is the best events team in the world period full stop it is it is true no it is true like 100% of the time half the room today is like how do I find a version of that person yeah I mean that's actually why we're recording this podcast yeah yeah there's an event going on and we're sitting here there are a room yeah well that technically we run this yeah well that and there are 45 people in that room running SAS companies doing between 10 and 30 million that experienced our event and said hey can we meet with your events team so we can do something like this so the the inspiration was hey let's figure out how to to to leave an artifact out there for how to go do that if you want to run a user conference how to make it more than a conference like it's not we have people say these are not conferences their experiences and the what we just talked about was taking a boring keynote with a slide deck and how did just do a few tweaks to the room is creating something together they're connecting with each other and it takes so much pressure off of actually what gets taught and instead makes it about what get caught y yeah so good and I'll tell you the uh from the founder side of it if you're the one giving the talk and if you're nervous about giving the talk the secondary impact of all of this orchestration is it actually takes an incredibly small amount of like slide deck or talk tracks to fill up a really impactful 60-minute window because you're not it's not about the volume of information like when I first started speaking I thought it was about the volume of information I need to craft this whole thing to fill up the time yeah and really if you orchestrate it to get the information flowing in two directions it's going to be a hundred times more impactful for the audience and you actually have to create less because you can co-create more and that for me that was a huge idea when I started figuring this stuff out yeah want hear a little sneaky trick I do that most people don't know if I have 30 minutes to kill I just I I change the size of the groups that are sharing so if I got 30 minutes to kill I'll go six to eight people in a group yeah yeah yeah most people will never know like if if the events person whisper you're like oh we we need to we got 30 minutes something got delayed no problem all right we're getting in groups of eight everybody's got four minutes I want you to share your biggest takeaways use the room 30 minutes on the clock and go you're one spreadsheet away from the answer it's so fun yeah once you understand this it just doesn't feel as pressure yeah yeah yeah it can be super fun yeah so if you're looking for some people to go get inspired by hands down I think someone who's mutually inspired us is Jason from Mastermind talks yeah Jason Gard at mmt Mastermind talks unfortunately almost impossible to get into tough one but apply use Matt verloc's name and then he can get the call for vouching for you if you know Matt well just go be curious he's produced a lot of he has a great podcast yeah he actually did an events one un unpacking how he runs events y um he doesn't sell it if you are friendly with him and donate to his charity he might send you a copy of it uh he's got a book coming out yeah he's got a book coming out is it on that topic though uh might be around Community stuff I think it was around building Community I thought yeah it's just his events are just so crazy orchestrated um John beroff so JN is the orchestration guy that I learned a lot of this from okay in yeah and then I would say Tak Mo so Mo definitely has a lot of stuff around how to produce events John beroff has a lot of content around orchestration of co-creation yeah and then uh Jason you know is a student of the game yeah I think that there's there's a an important distinction to make because we are blending and using the words of like conference and event and experience like interchangeably what we just talked about for the last 10 minutes around the orchestration of the room is creating the experience it's a lot less like you we're not you're not going to see this at dreamforce or at inbound those are if they did it'd be powerful right yeah but it's those are different where it really is about yeah I would say those are advanced moves start with a customer conference yes but if you want the magic what we what we're trying to communicate here is that it's not about the information that someone learns it's about the connections that they make so if we're trying to if our goal is to create raving fans who would get on a camera and leave a testimonial who would tell their friend about your product or who would buy more from you so we're making a revenue connection if the goal of the event is to do that we've we do that the conduit is community not content yeah agreed so spend your time get the minimum effective dose of content in place and focus the rest of your time just go study some of the greats in the game on how to create that experience use some of the things we' taught you here and you're going to be like 90% of the way there and uh you'll leave with with the the customer sentiment that you were after you if you double down on a Content you just might not you might not be as impressed because I will do a shout out there's a great book called How to create a workshop it's a yellow book and Sh yeah it's a great book so if somebody's like I still need a process just do that and then implement the seeds of what we shareed yeah but also as a process guy I'm going to talk process for just a sec your personal process it's study the greats yes read the books yes but if you're a founder and you want want to do this in your company and you've not joined some type of program a coaching program or another SAS company's experience or conference whatever like go consume the thing that you want to create first because once you see how it makes you feel you will be driven to go recreate the experience for the people you care about really really hard to produce something you haven't felt yourself yeah it's like go sign up for something go consume it because it goes back full circle to what you said in the beginning when you join a group or join a program or join a mastermind what is the one thing that's going to produce Roi for you it might be that you just are in the room that you want to create that could be the whole big idea for you yeah just sit in the room and then go make it I like it sweet how do you guys close these off when well here's here's my ask how do you guys close these off usually with a high degree of awkward pauses we nailing this well here's the deal if you go and do when you book a customer conference I want to know about it I'd love to hear about it yeah email Johnny what's your email tell Johnny atsas academy.com the official say email a podcast email and email Johnny direct oh yeah you can shoot an email to me my can I give him your cell phone number sure man's he's got a lot of time man good sign she might need to figure out why you got so much time what's going I didn't guarantee a response if you get out cell phone number friends and family have a hard enough time with a respons alone oh God all right well Dan good jamming this is fun you guys knocked out of the park so I'm really proud of you guys all right go run some conferences peace [Music]
