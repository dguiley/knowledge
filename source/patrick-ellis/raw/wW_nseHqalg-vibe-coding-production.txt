hey everybody I'm Patrick Ellis I am the CTO at snap R and just to give a little bit of context we're a uh early stage team we're about eight people 13ish if you include contractors and uh we're really trying to go for the highly leveraged using gen throughout the entire company uh uh meme that I'm sure everybody's seen on uh online so uh there's a lot of Applied learnings that I thought could be pretty interesting to share a quick background I've spent time in uh SF and Seattle over the last 10 years as a saac engineer and then been really diving deep the last uh I would say year and a half to a year on the Cod gen side and then kind of the last almost two years on the uh we we've had a gen based product in production uh mostly on the multimodal side so uh stable diff Fusion uh flux you know that toolkit um and then of course a lot of reasoning uh now as well so I've been uh trying to go as deep as I can I was just at the uh AI engineer Summit in New York uh a couple weeks ago and that was super helpful a lot of lessons uh and learnings from other attendees okay so where has Vibe coding really helped the first area is more of what I would actually consider Vibe coding for us so for our workflow that tends to include using bolt. new or lovable. deev um I'm sure most of you actually who is familiar with uh bolt or lovable okay yeah so basically everybody um so of course you know kind of a zero to one or Green Field uh you know new code based development um and then eventually taking that over with cursor or wind surf or I've actually been using Cloud code uh the most as of late I feel like it's been the most competent for our uh use cases so what's been really interesting with that is empowering the non-technical folks uh so even our product folks but um our sales uh even our CEO um being able to allow them to prototype and explore ideas and then uh uh taking that over on the engineering side sometimes that means actually uh uh like with a more ephemeral uh less um durable or kind of a um something that we're going to maintain long term something that's like a like a gallery or slideshow in our context um can be excellent to use that workflow for where we build it with cursor lovable and then like get it to uh integrate with our backend and everything using cursor wind surf for anything more complex of course that uh doesn't necessarily work but what is really valuable is using bolt. new and lovable to essentially uh communicate effectively from the non-technical folks to engineering what the requirements are are so you can think of it as like figma plus you know uh a bunch of you know uh requirements uh documentations and then actual like uh feedback with an engineer so instead of me working with our uh CPO for example um he can go and just kind of iterate with uh essentially an engineer um bolt or lovable to kind of get a sense of what capabilities are there I mean especially for somebody non-technical that's been a huge huge help for a lot of basic stuff that an engineer would help with so being able to uh Define the ideas as more concrete rely um and then either you know fully transfer those over or even using one of the models so you know CLA or whatever to describe in great detail the requirements uh from that new codebase into like a markdown dock which we can then use as uh a starter to apply a more disciplined Engineering Process uh using CLA code for example in order to build that up to an actual production application uh so that idea of using these models to create the code and then describe it which is like a Fidelity way to represent all the features and ideas and then to rebuild that using again more disciplined workflow uh has been really really valuable so yeah the non-engineering engineering requirements and capabilities communication as I just described um honestly it's been uh this workflow using bolt and uh lovable has been able to replace figma for a lot of uh our apps and again keep in mind we're earlier stage so um uh there's a lot of new development and new features that are actually a really really good fit uh for this workflow uh of course figma is still important for more mature uh versions of our products and then uh getting partner feedback customer Dev you know being able to like spin something up and show a salesperson um and then the uh development speed up um so yes a slideshow uh we went from Bolt to cursor and that is uh entering production this week um that was almost entirely Vibe coded obviously I've you know uh reviewed the PRS and made sure that we're not uh doing anything crazy um but it's a fairly or it's a very simple code base and then something more complicated like a new dashboard that we're building uh right now that is something where the the second approach I mentioned where we're exploring ideas um has has been uh much more helpful so um that's the first step is kind of the vibe coding side another piece that has been really valuable to us has been augmenting uh uh our traditional development workflows using CLA um so I I just described this quite a b um uh I think the difference here though in the more kind of disciplined approach as I mentioned is really treating the models as a par programmer or a thinking partner or a funny way I kind of like to uh think of this is uh I'm sure you guys have all read or heard of you know the pratic programmer and like the the rubber ducky uh on your desk right something that you can like kind of get out of your head and talk to even if it's an an adamit but it's kind of interesting that now we have actual things that we can talk to um and to iterate you know to kind of stay in flow but to have actual feedback and insights uh coming from that so this uh I think the cloud code docs do a great job of kind of concretely illustrating what this process can look like of having a more disciplined iterative approach so I would refer to those for uh again what's worked well for us but that um par programming approach you can get real production grade I think scalable um uh code bases out of that because you're of course intentionally thinking through what's happening your code reviewing your uh iterating and involved with the design process but it's still a huge huge multiplier of productivity at least in our context so again not Vibe coding it's it's a it's I consider that more traditional Vibe coding or traditional coding but with uh the discipline of the traditional software engineering uh workflow that said though everything I'm doing now is like almost completely different than it was two months ago in terms of my own process using a bunch of these tools and then um yeah uh aiding and a uh like automating Solutions engineering and inter PR customizations I think this is a pretty interesting one I don't know I haven't heard anybody talking about it I'm sure people are thinking about it though so for our use case uh we almost have like a new business model that's come out over the last year and it's uh a product highed service at greater scale so if you think of the amount of value that you can unlock as you push a little bit more into the agency side of operating uh so you know big Enterprise clients uh with more traditional Solutions engineering um customize almost like agency work uh so so I didn't mention this but snapbar we're like event marketing platform so we have a suite of AI tools that help uh uh marketers um in different contexts so for them having customization of the micro site for example that they have at some some large uh uh product release or whatever is really helpful um so by uh pushing a little bit more into the service side having more of what I would call traditionally a product High service we're able to capture a lot more value um uh in uh for our customers and provide a lot lot more value but then we're also able to uh heavily automate that or Aid it uh with you know these code gen tools and then sometimes or what we're pushing towards is fully automating it so you can imagine again making a bunch of like frontend customizations uh that the End customer is prompting an agent to do or right now what that looks like is our Solutions engineer uh uh operations folks using these uh code gen tools like cursor and uh wind surf in order to get that last mile so I think the second and third order impacts such as this uh business model are are pretty interesting to Think Through um and then uh we uh this was touched on a little bit but the strategy and marketing product research side of things uh so yeah deep research I mean it's using 03 under the hood so if you can get past the like deep uh research side of things you've got literally the most powerful model that open AI has right now to help you uh think through uh coding challenges and it and it it shows um I for us too though uh you know deep market research uh company stry uh product strategy feeding as much into it as we can uh giving it enough context to really help us think through our ideas whether that's product or again business strategy market research thinking through new releases um anything like that one other uh tactical piece that we found was really helpful is uh taking transcriptions uh this was just alluded to a bit uh from our meetings and then feeding them into notebook LM to use either the podcast feature which is incredible if you guys haven't used that or uh you know just be able to interact with it and ask specific questions but you can take that summary and then feed that into Claud for example to create like a PRD uh MD or like a other markup that can be helpful all right so um again there's there's uh no chance I'm going to finish through all these slides uh so I'll show the uh QR code at the end here and but I've got a list of a bunch of specific workflows and tools um one thing I uh wanted to cover here though so uh traditional AI models that you guys are all I'm sure uh familiar with with here that have been really helpful so of course Claud 37 has been great although it's a little ambitious for code genen and architecture um 01 Pro and 03 mini high for thinking through uh uh architectural approaches and then deep research for uh quickly learning about a new domain uh and then also helping uh get spun up on libraries uh tools um doing strategic research anything like that and then of course the Cod genen tools cursor wind surf Claud code for development and then bolt and lovable for uh new prototypes um and then what I found to be the most helpful mCP servers uh have been the uh um uh well there's the mCP directory and that's from the official like uh you know people behind the spec uh that anthropics been working with um so that's a great that GitHub repo has a bunch of resources then browser tools basically gives context uh to uh Claude or you know uh wherever you're using your mCP cursor uh to your browser uh like Network logs uh you know console logs and then it can take screenshots which is really helpful and as was mentioned earlier too just keeping it in context and allowing it to uh like the agent to have as much context as possible um uh in its session is super helpful and just allowing us to stay in flow as we're developing um and then uh fire crawl for turning any website into markdown that way these models don't have to parse a bunch of you know XML or HTML and a bunch of it distracting documents but can get right to the concise um uh context that is needed is super helpful I've also found personally that uh at least with cursor I um wind Surf and uh CLA code as well I don't feel like they do a great job of indexing docs uh so being able to actually pull whatever I'm working with a bunch and then shove that into uh a markdown file has been really helpful and just to give some context here uh skipping over the cursor rules since that was covered pretty well um uh the uh what I'll do is I'll create a I think I've got this here uh a context file um and or a like folder in my repo you don't have to but just to keep things organized and then I'll create a docs file and then throw any documentation that I'm working with external like I just mentioned uh using uh fire craw mCP to go out and programmatically grab stuff or just using fire craw directly and then uh putting those markdown files in the docs and then also um we had you know maybe uh I don't know 80 pages of API documentation for one of our services in Google Docs so I just uh saved that or you can export it as a markdown file and then brought that directly into uh this this folder as well which can be a little heavy on the context but you know was super helpful for us um so uh and then uh a couple other tools you know the Google Docs piece I just mentioned then of course super whisper if you guys are familiar shout out to art for uh uh giving me a bunch of tool recommendations including this one uh but that's to get the you know true vibe coding being able to uh like hit a hot key and then have a model transcribe your uh Speech and then it's context tow so it knows is it uh in a you know cursor uh terminal is it uh in a like a text message thread is it in an email context so it can um clean up your text or or not clean up your text depending on the use case which is just so helpful for that uh rapid iteration uh how am I doing on time Tyler five minutes five minutes okay um all right so I just wanted to cover so I've got um some strategy and helpful patterns and then the some workflow tips here I'm just kind of giving you guys uh so this is like the exact workflow I'll use um including the context that I'll generate you know PRD docs that kind of stuff and then a bunch of educational resources here um one thing I'll touch on I think because the space is moving so incredibly fast uh I mean it's just wild as everybody knows I mean each week there's there's new stuff for us to to dive deep into having good sources of knowledge and being able to uh really efficiently uh filter through the noise and find the signal is so important so I just want to highlight these and I'll go back to the strategy bit uh anything late in space they're the people uh swix and and a few others behind AI engineer Worlds Fair um which I found tons of value for from their podcast the latent space podcasts here and then their uh website which is just uh Laton dospace I believe yeah at the top there uh those are two excellent excellent resources uh they've got like a a 2024 uh or like in a 2024 AI Engineers uh white paper like the mustre white papers across a bunch of different domains they're a little bit more focused on true AI engineering so like applied AI ml or you know using llms and and reasoning within your app but uh super helpful for the vibe coding side of things as well um anyway some some great uh uh you know anything Kathy uh uh the fasta AI for more ml uh resources um a bunch of great conferences including of course Joe's AI tinkerers which is incredible um and then some great YouTube channels I'll just highlight AI explained really quick uh he does an amazing job of covering new white papers uh new um uh advancements or like releases coming out from any of the Frontier Labs would highly highly recommend giving them a follow um and then of course the AI engineer uh uh the conference they have a bunch of their YouTube videos brought over there um so um here's the uh QR code to those uh just to highlight that um if you wanted a couple uh pieces of strategy uh that I just wanted to to touch on in my last couple minutes here I think the biggest thing i' I've found using all this is that context really really matters um so what like the way I like to think about about it is I mean if you were the model and like having empathy for the model if you were only told what what's the model has access to so like what's in context uh what's indexed in the code base uh what mcps it has access to it could go out and grab what's in your context folder uh and you know like the API docs and everything I mean that's all it knows and if you think about this is a great reason to go out and and learn more the fundamentals of how these llms work but if you understand their architecture if you understand what they were trained on uh and kind of this like a this F um you know long-term memory if you will to draw an analogy to us there's only so much that they can pull from uh so one being able to really highlight things that you want it to help you with so giving concrete examples pulling in these precise docks um making sure that you reference uh the the thread that you had above so that the model really does you know anchor to that part of the neural net um and you know be able to like fire from its most competent uh uh weights um uh doing all that is so helpful so just thinking really concretely about your context and what you're asking it to do uh and being you know uh articulate and and concrete in your thoughts is is really important so Vibe coding of course is fun from like uh using super whisper and running quickly but if you really want to get great results out of these models and they're in or they're capable of incredible things in my uh experience if you do uh writing well and and and treating it like a true pair of programmer or another person on the team is is is very critical so that's that's probably the most valuable uh the context is everything piece here um and then yeah defining your con your stack up front so like what tooling again this was covered really well earlier uh you're using is is so valuable that way you're anchoring especially with bolt or um lovable you're anchoring the output to what your codebase actually is um this has been helpful for us on the non-technical side uh you know making sure those folks are aligned with our code base um and then of course choosing libraries and Frameworks that have a ton of training data uh so you know anything script react nextjs uh node tends to have you a ton of open source examples um and then a lot of these libraries are more modern tech Stacks too I feel like the the training data or the quality of the apps that they're pulling from are are really highend so unfortunately due to time this is the last thing I'll say um what's been great is these are really good at uh UI design and um like a bunch of or like like even SEO being able to just like quickly get a suggestion if you will going into your app and just asking it for ways to improve SEO um uh you know again same thing with design as was brought up earlier and I think part of it is the training data plus the prompting being able to pull from really wellestablished uh code bases um and like great uh paradigms so for our team especially the non-technical team but you know like for me as well I'm starting projects out not from just my own understanding but pulling from some of these you know great patterns in modern code bases uh you know style uh guidelines Frameworks and then I'm starting stting there versus just what I would come up with on my own so I think by using these tools we're able to aggregate a bunch of knowledge and really have a boost to uh uh to what the end product is because we're iterating on you know an 80% Baseline versus a 50% Baseline if you want to think about it that way anyways thanks for your time all right that was exactly 20 minutes but if you want to to take like one question want to ask p a question yeah when you're doing a Enterprise sort of customization of your application but like letting the customer let's say fiddle around with the UI are you like tenant basing that or are you just saying like go ahead and modify the UI any way that you want just deal with the consequences for everybody else great question so uh uh our workflow for a lot of the customizations is actually uh a a git-based workflow actually this might be kind of interesting to folks uh so we use netfi for a lot of to provision a lot of our front ends or host them uh so we actually will just uh provision a branch uh so all the logic is the same as our core branch and then it's really easy for us to obviously make that change and then just assign them a subdomain uh and then uh that completely isolates any changes you need to that client um on the back end we have a it's a little bit more complicated but most of our our changes for Enterprise uh are on the front end and we use a uh nodejs functions quite a bit in order to uh get around any uh seeking points that that might bring up all right thanks yeah thanks
