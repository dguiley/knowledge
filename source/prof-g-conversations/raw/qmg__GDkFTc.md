China does not benefit from this war continuing they would like the uh Russians to have a ceasefire it is undermining China's relationship with Europe which especially the Frontline states which they would like to be more stable it is making it harder for the Chinese to have flexibility globally they really don't like the Russia North Korea relationship they want this war over as you said before Chinese need stability the Russians are chaos actors so they're not fully aligned in this if I Trump I would absolutely reach out to the Chinese to be a part of this [Music] solution Ian where does this podcast find you I'm in New York uh in our new headquarters your Asia group's top risk report for 2025 is out in the report you say we are heading back to the law of the Jungle that's dramatic where the strongest do what they can while the weakest are condemned to suffer what they must what did you mean by that for the last 35 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union the fall of the wall we talked at least nominally about the idea that we're living in an increasingly globalized world that the United States is a democracy that supports rule of law around the world supports other democracies collective security all of those things uh and and and yet the reality is that order is breaking down it's breaking down for a lot of reasons it's breaking down because uh the Russians uh were are not a part of the West they're in Decline structurally they're really angry about it they blame the US and they've now alliancedata they're they're actually becoming in many ways a more Consolidated dictatorship under xiin ping and they're putting more pressure on the private sector they're supporting more privately owned national champions and state capitalist uh state owned Enterprises uh and so that's that's causing much more conflict uh in the most important geopolitical relationship in the world and then you know most importantly um the US in particular has just fundamentally rejected the idea that going to be global leaders supporting rule of law and multilateral institutions it's America first baby it's it's our way or the highway um and uh and we're going to tell other countries that you're going to work with us and do the things we want our way um or there's going to be hell to pay and so yeah that that sounds a lot like a reversion to the law of the Jungle um that the powerful and strongest countries and people get to do what they want I think Trump is is much more of a winner uh than he is a leader I think that Elon is much more of a winner than he is a leader what do you mean by that well lead leaders are people that in their organizations they bring people together so if you're the leader of the United States All American citizens look and they say this is my leader Your Leader Corporation all of the all the people in that Corporation say this is my leader if you're a winner right you divide you're a winner there are other winners and then there are losers right and I really think that that is a fundamental challenge that American democracy has and American capitalism has that we we've we've moved away from being a country of leaders um that are trying to make a difference for their fellow man and woman and fellow citizens in the world and instead we're we're winning individually um but we're very tribal we're very divided including inside our own country and with our allies and that makes the world a much more dangerous place and if you're a loser you got to suck it up you got to accept the rules that the winners are making right because they they won so I mean you know if you're Mark Zuckerberg you know you better you better change your attitude my friend because it's not about how how successful you've been it's about are you on board with the winners right I mean and that's true for everybody if if you're a if you're the French the Germans the Brits you know you better get get on board if you're the Canadians right I mean Trudeau just resigned did he resign a little faster because he screwed up with Trump yeah I think so I think Trump pushed him I mean he was shot in the face by uh by Chris Freeland his Deputy Prime Minister but he was still on life support uh until Trump uh shived him uh and uh and and now he's out you know so and I think there's a lot of that happening in the world today geopolitically as well as in your world Scott so just a couple thesis I want you to respond to or get your reaction in terms of the law the Le my sense is we're the king of the jungle we being the us and that is I look at our enemies adversaries so let's start with um Iran Russia and North Korea and so you throw China in too if you want to well I think of China I'll come back that but I think China is what I call an adversary or competitor but not our I completely agree it's a different category but it's interesting because they're weaker now than they were a couple years ago 100% so this is you're this is the thesis and you respond to it terms of our enemies we're kicking their ass and that is Iran's air defenses have been penetrated by Israel their proxies the houis Hamas and Hezbollah have had their hands cut off and Assad's gone and Assad's gone basically kind of the the Ally of Russia has had to flee to Russia because of because of a collapse there Russia is bogged down in a war they were not expecting to go this long with these types of results and then let's move to as you said our our competitor SL adversary not our enemy their economy has just been underwhelming the last 10 years whereas ours has accelerated I mean it's better to be lucky than good I see Trump as inheriting the strongest hand he could have in America on almost every Dimension other than the fact we hate each other and a lot of our prosperity is is not being distributed equally on a balanced scorecard on a relative scorecard we are kicking everyone's ass your thoughts first let me add to your list because you mentioned um enemies and adversary SL competitor and I do think that's the right way to put it I think China is not the axis of Evil or a pariah State the way that the North Koreans Russians and Iranians are those are chaos actors that want to destroy the International System they want to defeat the Americans the Chinese actually need a stable global economy to prosper themselves so even if they would like to defeat the Americans they know that that doesn't work with their system but in addition to that America's allies are also weaker right technologically much weaker I mean you think about where the Americans are in terms of Entrepreneurship and semiconductors and Ai and all these new companies and the markets and the strength of the dollar where are the Europeans where are the Japanese where are the South Koreans where are the Canadians the answer is nowhere land and their governments are so weak the US has just elected Trump and unlike last time around right with with Biden winning and January 6 I mean Trump has a mandate and unlike 2017 Trump has coattails right I mean the the Republicans see that they need him not the other way around so he's appointed a whole bunch of loyalists you don't have any Rex Tillerson in this group uh no Jim Mattis in this group no Nikki Haley in this group so no Mike Pence in this group right so he's Consolidated he's strong he's willing to use American power and America's allies are incredibly weak their governments are falling apart South Korea Germany France Canada right all of these countries so everywhere you look the United States is stronger now I also think at home the US is not in Decline um not at all the people still want to come to America the American economy is doing very well American Military is doing well it's technology is doing very well but of course you said except the fact that we hate each other not just that not just that Scott except the fact that our political system is increasingly not representative it's increasingly captured by money and special interests the US system is increasingly a two-tier system and it's not Democrats versus Republicans it's access to power versus no access to power right and and that is uniquely dysfunctional in the context of advanced indust industrial democracies so you've got a political system that is not working that is arguably in crisis I mean if if Narendra Modi who is the most popular democratically elected leader of a large country in the world today okay buou and El Salvador hasn't beat um but in a big country if he were to have a phone call or meetings with heads of state and CEOs and bring in gaad money you and I would rightly State this country is an oligarchy it's a kleptocracy and yet that's precisely what's happening with Trump and Elon right now and it's completely normalized so I I do think that we can't just say well with the exception of the fact that we hate each other and the political system doesn't work actually that's a pretty cool thing about the United States is the fact that the US has a political system that other countries are supposed to admire are supposed to be more aligned with we've got values that set the standards for the rest of the world rule of law is something that the rest of the world wants to be a part of our worldview is supposed to be the dominant Collective worldview that's not true anymore so we're very powerful and in the law of the Jungle We're The Big Ape absolutely but the law of the Jungle is a much more brutal nasty and dangerous place than then a world that has laws and accountability and responsibility and institutions and architecture that the United States is leading with its allies in trying to get other countries to increasingly align with it it's a radically different place you bring up an interesting thought on that is you know we're now 50% of the world's market capitalization our stocks there's one company in the US that is more valuable than every stock market with the exception of Japan but if there is a global crisis that emerges as strong as we are we just can't go It Alone we need allies and I don't care if it's World War II or you know repelling Saddam out of Kuwait whatever it might be you know even addressing covid there needs to be Global cooperation there needs to be a certain level of Goodwill there needs to be alliances and I think first and foremost I think of um how successful NATO has been keeping the peace since World War II is it fair to say that those Alliance have been dramatically frayed thereby making it a more dangerous world for America despite its strength it's an interesting question Scott you know on the one hand the level of trust of American Allies for the United States that the US would be there when push comes to shove has eroded dramatically so there I mean if if a collective security uh is is in some somehow fundamentally based on the notion that the that that you you believe in each other you're accountable for each other um I think it has weakened on the other hand um the Europeans are spending a lot more on defense now than they were and the Japanese are spending a lot more on defense now than they were and Mark Ruta uh the new Secretary General of NATO former prime minister of the Netherlands um is now working with the Europeans to move to 3% uh GDP spend on defense which they're doing outside of the EU mechanisms so that the hungarians can't veto it which means they are moving I think that's going to happen uh which means that they're going to be in all likelihood by the end of the Trump Administration the Europeans will be paying about as much percentage of GDP on defense as the Americans do so that's a that's a stronger NATO and I mean when Trump demands that NATO allies spend more on defense that's not a protin message that's the exact opposite of what Putin wants them to do so it's kind of interesting right I mean it's the in the same way that America is not in Decline but its political system is the alliances like the soft power the the the the willingness to engage with each other on the basis of we like you we trust you this matters to us that has eroded a lot and yet with America as a much more powerful country that other countries have to align with or else um you know actually the Americans can drive a lot more and so you know I you saw this in our wrist report we have red herrings at the end things that people think are going to happen that that we think will not and one of our herrings was Trump fails and you know you see this a lot in the mainstream media oh this guy's a buffoon he's incompetent you know he only cares about himself so of course he's going to fail all over the place we don't think so we think that Trump is going to say a whole bunch of stuff and people are going to get on board they're going to align with him I mean if you think that Facebook and apple are kissing his ass in Mara Lago that's nothing compared to how foreign governments who are aligned with the United States and know they can't afford to do anything else the Mexicans you know the Europeans they're going to want to find a way to ensure they don't have a crisis with this guy so he's going to have a lot of wins uh in the early stages it's interesting because to be fair what I think what you're saying is Trump's I don't know I wouldn't call it a middle finger but his rolling his eyes or is uh his lack of fear of saying aggressive things about allies has resulted in an increase in spending which should if you will we still might be the world's policemen but other people are now buying their own squad cars that this has been a direct positive result of of Trump's actions are adversarial tone complexion with our allies do you agree I I do I do uh but also um I would say that the Gap is Big it's going to take a long time for them to uh spend at that level to get close to capabilities to really defend themselves this is not going to get resolved in four years even if their uh level of spending at that point percentage wise is equivalent to the US and some countries are already there the baltics Poland you know some of the nordics that kind of thing but also there's a question of the fact that the Americans have the capacity to be a global policeman even with support Trump has no interest in doing that right I mean Trump was the one that cut the deal with the Taliban that Biden then executed on um he Syria you know you've got a government that's now in place in Syria that's very unlikely going to be able to stabilize that incredibly complex uh and volatile territory uh you've got over 2,000 US troops stationed in Syria right now Trump doesn't want to keep those troops there if Trump pulls them out it's not like France is going to send those troops it's not like the UK is uh it's much more likely that the Turks are going to be on the ground they're going to hit the Kurds hard um no longer jailing Isis on the ground and the potential for that to become fertile for a new caliphate is real so I mean the absence of the us as a willing policeman will save American taxpayers it will put fewer lives uh at risk but it will lead to more ungoverned spaces it will lead to more depredation more forced migration that will affect other countries to a much greater degree than the us because the US is you know geographically very well located and between Canada and Mexico in two big bodies of water um but but the world will become more dangerous and more unstable so you know there's that so and I don't know if this is a function of living abroad now but when I come back or I don't I don't feel as I'm as in touch with America which is a good and a bad thing and I'd like to think it's offered some perspective but I am mildly horrified minus the mildly and what I see is this full Embrace by not only our leaders but by um acceptance by our media and the general public of what is just an obvious naked unafraid and unashamed kleptocracy that if you look at the inaugural campaigns I think of all the Big 10 or the magaz and 10 there was like a couple $200,000 um donations to the inaugural campaign or inaugural celebration of Biden and now every one of them is lined up and put in a million bucks I mean this feels like literally an episode of The Sopranos where they walk into the local retailer and say you know it'd be a shame if your windows got broken and this place got robbed we need protection money and this has now gone full kleptocracy where musk increases his wealth by 150 or 200 billion for no other reason as far as I can tell that they assume that because he put in a quarter of a billion dollars that the largest deepest pocketed customer in the world will throw money at him and anybody else who decides pay for play have we gone is it is it unfair to say we have gone full kleptocratic with the trajectory is very strongly in that direction and it was already bad uh before Trump I mean you know three billion plus spent on our presidential election over two years doesn't need to be that way um you know the incredible uh willingness of special interests in the US um to capture the regulatory system to write their own policies you know that that's not a a competitive free market a competitive free market uh is one where you've got Regulators that represent the public interest and companies have to compete against each other it's not about who has more access to power and who has the ability to write regulations that support them and get subsidies it's about who has the best product who's the most competitive we're very far from that in the United States right now we still have you know a great environment for small Enterprises that start up with Plucky entrepreneurs like you and I have experienced and benefited from through our lives but in America's still great at that but in terms of big corporations and billionaires no we're talking about a country that is uh open to the highest bidder and our allies see that and they're worried about it they don't like it um and it's not the way their systems run not the advanced industrial economy anyway it's closer to way a lot of Emerging Markets run um and uh and we should worry I think a lot about that absolutely um and that's that's where the Elon thing really bothers me uh less about freedom of speech and more about you know what does it mean what does he get for his quarter of a billion dollars um with Trump I mean we see how much access he has we see that he I mean he has a position a non-governmental advisory position in Doge we see his uh ability to talk directly with competitor CEOs while he's sitting with the president or heads of state while he's sitting with the president um to functionally even veto legislation when he speaks out against it get people aligned I mean that's that's a pretty unique position we've not seen anyone like that uh before he's certainly the most powerful individual in the private sector that the US has experienced since the Gilded Age um what does that mean what does that mean for the United States domestically its political system what does that mean for the US with its allies in the global order I don't think it's a good development we'll be right back so you touched on Syria and RIS number nine you called ungoverned spaces do you think and you did begin to outline this do you think what's happened in Syria is a net positive or negative for the West I think the fact that Assad has gone is a net positive for the West um because Assad uh was uh an utterly uh brutal dictator um who uh allowed um for um more people around the world to believe that they could act with impunity in their own backyards get away with it right he was an ally to not just Russia but Iran he facilitated um the illegal transfer of weapons from Iran into Lebanon strengthening Hezbollah which is seen by the us as a terrorist organization as a principal adversary of Israel he was the principal uh oversaw the principal production uh of uh captagon um a an incredibly addictive uh enormously debilitating illegal drug that was being exported all over the region um and Europe uh and some to the United States I I am delighted that he's gone and I don't shed any tears about him getting poisoned uh in Moscow uh within a couple weeks of the Russians accepting him uh in quotes when has replaced him um is H at best at best uncertain uh I mean this this new government uh uh you know came out of you know Isis connected folks um and they are certainly showing that they want to be more inclusive that they've turned over a new Leaf but you know does that really mean that they're going to be either capable or willing uh to run a more stable more inclusive government that won't um either collapse uh or uh won't uh launch a war against large numbers of its own citizens we'll have to wait and see but no it it's clearly a positive a net positive for the west and for everyone that aside is gone so one of the few places I think we have a bit of a differing Viewpoint is on Israel and the conflict there and I'll put forward another thesis that Israel's bold and courageous actions taking out more terrorists in six weeks and we took out in 25 years on our most wanted list uh cutting off the hands of the proxies of Iran um incredibly bold PR the most precise anti-terrorist action or operation in history with the pagers and Hezbollah that Israel has demonstrated not only tremendous power expertise in strategy here but they in my view their actions are going to make the Middle East a safer more stable more uh pro-west place because of their actions um your thoughts um well first of all uh the only risk um that shows up in our our report on the Middle East one is that oil prices are likely to be low which means uh less money for the Gulf States both for themselves as well as to help countries in the region that need and have benefited from their aid like Jordan for example Egypt for example Tunisia for example and secondly uh Iran um which is a significant risk in part because uh they are um uh their regime is on life support they've lost their empire and the Americans and the Israelis might well decide this is the opportunity to really hit them those are the risks so I mean we didn't have in the report Hezbollah or the West Bank or Gaza because the Israelis have shown that they are militarily dominant uh they St they determine the nature of escalation and their enemies can't do anything to them and that that includes frankly the Iranians um so I I certainly accept the fact um that the Israelis have defeated um their enemies to in a pretty spe spacular fashion uh over the last year and a bit uh following October 7th I agree with that um where where you and I probably disagree and we've had discussions about this in the past Scott um is that uh I don't believe that you can resolve the Palestinian Problem by blowing them all up I just don't I mean I I think that you know if Hamas is an army they're defeated if Hamas is an ideology and an idea you probably made them stronger because you've radicalized people for Generations um and and what I see in Gaza and the lack of humanitarian support um and the comparative breath of bombing um and lack of willingness to be accountable for uh the the risks of the civilian population um and I'm not in any way trying to say that Israel shouldn't want to blow up Hamas I I absolutely accept terrorist organization they've done horrible things to the Israelis and to their own population but but ultimately the fact that as a result of this war um the Palestinians are facing far greater depredation than they were on October 6th and also the Palestinians in the West Bank have lost a lot more territory they're living under more of a Security State they are much farther from having a state I believe that will lead to more radicalism I believe that will lead to more violence uh against Israel against the United States um and more broadly in the region I believe that now I mean how do you balance those things because again at the end of the day Israel is a tiny country they're very wealthy they're incredible in terms of surveillance if they keep their eyes on the ball as nanyu did not before October 7th they will have great control over their borders so you know I think in the context of that you know maybe they can effectively occupy Palestinian territories and the Palestinians will just live as an imprisoned people it's possible and that that won't be a threat to Israel I I don't believe that that's Humane that's not a world I want to live in but I also don't think it's true so I mean even if you don't care about the Palestinians as people and there are a lot of people that don't um I I believe and I do uh but but I I understand that there are people that just you know have decided that's my enemy and I don't care um but I I actually believe that you know these are these are people that are industrious they are capable and with Advanced Technologies they will increasingly find ways to make their voice heard and I worry about that I mean I worry about that in the same way that I worry about when the CEO of United Healthcare is assassinated by some pretty boy idiot um that a whole bunch of people on the internet and by the way some establishment Democrats like seem to lionize the guy oh I understand what he did this what happens you radicalize people they do crazy and they have supporters and I I worry that the Palestinians are increasingly going to be prone larger numbers of them to do crazy with supporters this idea and a lot of people hold it that you even if you kill you can kill people but you can't kill an idea I would push back and say we for the most part killed communism we for the most part at least we thought killed Fascism and at the end of World War II we were bombing Hamburg we killed 40 service or military and killed 40,000 civilians and we had already won the war and when asked the generals and Eisen now asked why they continued to devastate hurg they said they need to know they lost and I know that sounds brutal but I would argue that we would have done worse uh had we been as viciously attacked and two when you actually look at the data specifically the deaths of combatants relative to civilians that the Israelis are Prosecuting this war more humanely than any Western nation has prosecuted Another War your thoughts I I accept the fact that um the United States um in the war in Iraq um and in Afghanistan uh also saw massive amounts of of Civilian damage uh and brutality except to completely um but uh let me I I was focused when I when I said I I take exception to the way the Israelis are prosti this war I've talked about the utter lack of humanitarian Aid getting in to Gaza um and I also talked about taking more land and the greatest Security State in the West Bank um and again I think those things matter now uh I I don't think you need you can blow up Hamas and still allow food in for the Palestinians um I mean my view is that if you're a friend of Israel as I am um you want Israel to do well and sustainably long term uh and that means criticizing Israel when you think it's up the United States which has been the the strongest supporter of Israel Bar None no one else is close um over the last year has been incredibly critical mostly privately of the fact that not enough Aid has gotten in so again my point here is simply that I believe that there's going to be greater radicalization and we need to move um to thinking about how after they've lost and do they know they've lost it's not like just the war since October 7 the Palestinians have known that they've lost for decades now right I mean like they have less and less territory they've been moved farther and farther out their their opportunities economic opportunities educational opportunities are more and more constrained a lot of that is on their own poor governance don't get me wrong it's not just all about Israel a lot of that's because they were forgotten by the Gulf States a lot of that's because the Americans don't care about them the Europeans don't care about me no one cares about the Palestinians except the Palestinians they do the Palestinians care about the Palestinians and and ultimately I think that's going to cause a problem h Qatar sent over a billion dollars which they decided to spend on tunnels and Rockets haven't they been the beneficiary of a tremendous amount of Aid cutar has been the single biggest uh supporter um on the ground uh in Gaza over past years and of course that's now been cut off absolutely but if you look at what kind of support the Palestinians have had on the ground to build their economy um compared uh to other countries actual countries in the region the answer is very very little and look you know that my mother's side of the family is Armenian um you know I mean 125,000 Armenians just ethnically cleansed um from narak and no one's talking about you're not going to ask me about it it's not in our top risk report we didn't write about at all even in ungoverned territories we even bother to mention it because nobody cares and that's what I'm saying law of the Jungle you know the fact is we could have a very long conversation about why it got to this situation where 100 25,000 civilians got tossed out of their homes left with nothing places blown up occupied all their historic monuments their churches blown up nobody talks about it it bothers me as a person you know but the fact is I mean look we talk about the Palestinians because it gets a lot more attention but we could there are so many places where these are the same conversations but again I want I I love this because I want to stop you because I feel like I'm sitting across the table from someone I respect immensely and I can have a civil conversation around things I recognize I feel strongly about but I don't know what I don't know and that is you you talk about we're not having these conversations around the 120,000 people who have been disappeared in Syria under Assad or you know what's happened in Yemen isn't it mostly because when Jews kill people it's it's seen as a different crime against humanity than when other people kill people isn't there just in a tremendous double standard here in look I I think that there are all sorts of double standards but they don't just go one way I mean the Holocaust has been seared in the imagin the collective historical memory and the imagination of everyone that lived at that time and since um and you know for a long time the Jews were seen to be like the principal Global victim and we all had to ensure that never happened again today that is not true today Israel is the dominant military actor in the entire Middle East not just Vis AES the Palestinians and they are the ones that get to decide now we in the United States love an underdog um I I think that there has been a shift for a lot of young people in the United States that suddenly don't see support for Israel as support of the underdog they think that we're somehow the bad guys because like we're in favor of the powerful um and not infavor pressed and but and the ukrainians are you know in the position that the Israelis used to be in so I think there's some of that I think there is there's been a massive surge um in anti-Semitism around the world very disturbing and that certainly has to do with the fact there are hell of a lot more Muslims than there are Jews and a lot of them are on Tik Tok for example um and so you see that performing algorithm Al not because Tik Tok is nefarious but just because it performs with those eyeballs there's some of that and also the fact that there's just a lot of media occupying that space you know I mean this is this is an area that has a lot of journalists on the ground and covering it there ain't no journalists in Sudan or Yemen writing about it this part of the world matters economically technologically it doesn't Sudan nobody cares right it doesn't have a market impact there's no one that's going to school there that's going to come and talk about there's not as much of a diaspora in the west there is when you talk about the Israelis and um the Palestinian so I I think there are lots of reasons and you can't to simplify this to just one factor you and I would not do that about any other discussion we'd have we certainly wouldn't want to simplify this um in that way let me let me press pra again first comment I absolutely love these conversations so thank you two you said that Tik Tok not because Tik Tok is nefarious another thesis Tik Tok is largely influenced if not controlled by the CCP who has a strategic reason to deposition us or make us weaker if they can't beat us economically or kinetically why wouldn't they put their thumb on the scale of content that polarizes us resulting in 52 Pro Hamas videos for everyone pro- Israel video which according to the research I've seen is taking place on Tik Tok in some I would argue Tik Tok is nefarious and purposely trying to delegitimize or create polarization amongst our public so I think social media is nefarious um and I agree um that uh Tik Tock is uh certainly influenced by um the CCP uh the Communist Party of China um and and we should not trust that um they have said that they are not giving any information to the Chinese Communist party that has been proved in many investigations Wall Street Journal other reports to be not true so I'm I'm not comfortable with the idea that Tik Tok is just a free market Corporation that's only seeking profits and nothing matters but to the extent that the Chinese have been involved in cyber operations to influence us elections and the Russians have been involved the Iranians and the North Koreans the Russians are actively promoting information uh that is trying to increase a sense of racism rage violence hostility Mal treatment I mean they're flooding The Zone with um in ways that really is trying to disrupt an undermine US democracy and stability China's cyber influence on the US elections was overwhelmingly intelligence seeking it was get inside the systems to figure out what they're really doing so that we can ad be take advantage from it it was uh also get inside critical structure so that just in case things go badly we might be able to blow these guys up so uh I'm someone that believes that I don't know what I don't know I know what I know I am not inside I know the CEO of Tik Tok I've met him many times I'm not inside their decision-making process I don't know what they're saying to the Communist party but I know what I see the evidence from what the Chinese have done in other areas there's no reason for me to believe that that would uniquely and somehow be different with Tik Tok than it is with their entire National strategy which has been risk averse and influence and information maximizing for them directly it has not been breaking and blowing up um the United States and I also think that there's a much simpler aams Razer explanation for why young people would get a lot more Pro Islam and pro Palestinian content then they would get pro-israel and Pro Jewish and it's because Tik Tok is a global platform with enormous numbers of people from Pakistan and Indonesia on it um and and also oriented towards younger people that are already even in the west much more Pro Palestinian than they are pro Israel all over the world and that's just being driven algorithmically I think that's the simplest argument so that's that's how I feel about that let's talk about Ukraine give us this give us your state of play in Ukraine so uh you'll remember back at the beginning of 2024 you and I talked about this and I said and I wasn't happy about it at all I said I think Ukraine is going to get partitioned you were one of the first people that ever said that out loud I will I want to point that out you said look this land they're never getting it back it's essentially what you said yeah and it's and and I mean I want to be very clear I really don't want that outcome but you know it's it's not it's not for me to be telling everybody what I want it's it's much more about you know sort of what where you think things are going um and the ukrainians uh I think increasingly understand uh that uh they're now um trying to position themselves for the best possible negotiation where they are going to have to lose uh most if not all of the territory that the Russians presently occupy they'd like a little leverage which is why they're continuing the offensive incur which is inside Russia so that they have something to trade that's going to make the negotiations more fraught uh but but does give them leverage um the Russians also are uh they'd benefit from a breather um I mean yeah they've got 15,000 North Korean troops that you know are are not fighting well and are are dying in large numbers but they're having a harder time uh raising significant numbers of troops for the war effort uh and their economy is increasingly performing badly um under strain of sanction and lack of human capital I think that Trump is going to succeed uh in getting a ceasefire I don't think it's going to take a day it's going to be hard of any thought but but when he tells the ukrainians you need to accept what I'm telling you or else first of all he's creating some cover for zalinsky to say look I've got no choice now because of the Americans which is helpful to zalinski frankly uh but also he does know that the Americans will cut off Aid if he doesn't so that will move and the French macron have has also delivered that message just yesterday to zinski he's heard it from the Germans and others so he's getting that pressure and the Russians also know though it's harder to pressure them in this environment the US has less leverage they know uh that if they don't accept negotiations in a ceasefire that they're going to get tougher sanctions from from Trump I I do believe that and Trump has delivered that message I also thought it was very interesting I mean Trump's tweets aren't always interesting but sometimes they are and there was one he put out um a couple weeks ago that said um about Russia Ukraine that also China can help and it was very interesting that Trump would say that I I fully agree with it China does not benefit from this war continuing they would like the uh Russians to have a ceasefire it is undermining China's relationship with Europe which especially the Frontline states which they would like to be more stable it is making it harder for the Chinese to have flexibility globally they really don't like the russan North Korea relationship they want this war over as you said before the Chinese need stability the Russians are chaos actors so they're not fully aligned in this if I were Trump I would absolutely reach out to the Chinese to be a part of this solution and and the first Trump xan pin call is going to be utterly fascinating for so many reasons but this is one of them so just as we we wrap up here and we have a lot of young people listen to this podcast and are very focused on trying to develop their own careers and I think a lot of people listen to this and hear about your background in gz media and think God that is just such a cool job in business what just give us just a cliff notes I would imagine your business is booming and what is the friction right now in your business when you look at 2025 as the founder of this consulting firm or Media Company what is the what are you most excited about and most worried about as it relates to being an entrepreneur and building building your business well I mean I it's kind of funny uh because of course given that we try to help people understand the world when there's more uncertainty more people need us and that's true both in terms of the companies that pay us to do Consulting and advisory work and also in terms of the the the just the members of the public that engage with our our media channels and the rest uh I mean we did a lot better growth-wise in the Trump Administration than we did in Biden um I mean you know leaving aside the fact that tax rates went down but so so all the corporates did well under that but and you know just generally speaking much more uncertainty driven by the Trump Administration and we already see that uh starting now uh he's certainly acting as president with with Biden you know do doing much less um I expect that'll be true again so that that's not a point of friction um the point of friction and I think you'll appreciate this so we've got you know like almost 250 employees right um for me that sounds amazing because I started as a kid from the projects and it was just sound like a headache well I've got a CEO it's not like I'm running it but but I mean 250 people is a small company in the grand scheme of things it's a small company um and the the biggest point to friction is that we need to ensure that the bets that we make in a given year there are so many places that we could go and engage and and and and build the firm uh different types of business different geographies different sectors we can invest in different kinds of Staff all sorts of things we can do and yet at a as a firm with 250 people you know you can only make four or five of those bets in a serious way in any given year so it's not about who your competitors are globally it's much more about you know marshalling your resources intelligently yourself and making those bets so they're not singles um but they're a couple of them are actually home runs that they really they really do um you know you're you're you're so you're constrained I mean it's kind of like you and I have so many hours in the day you've got so many hours with the kids before they don't they don't want to talk to you anymore how are you going to spend that time with them that maximizes it we've got you know only so many people and so much money we can deploy how do we do that in a big world the r with opportunity there's too much opportunity in the world and there's there's there's only one of me and there's only one EUR as group only one g0 media how you know how how do you do that and and I'm an optimist my eyes are always bigger than my stomach everything can work out the people around me are meant to sort of you know ensure that there is structure and reality um around all of that um and I think they do a real good job yeah it's the charge of any leader is not what to do but what not to do how you allocate Capital to its greatest return Ian Bremer is is the president and founder of Eurasia group the world's leading political
