I'm Alex Ramoszi. Welcome to my $100 million Money Models book launch event. [music] >> I think it's possible to put a book in the hand of every entrepreneur in America. I'm hoping that more people get into entrepreneurship who are not. People who are in it do [music] better. and the people who are doing really well helped me on my mission to get the books in everyone's hands. I thought it would be cool at the beginning to have the $100 million series do a $100 million launch. So the $100 million book series was actually written as one book and it had offers, it had leads and it had money models. This massive thing I then broke it into constituent parts. each one stacked another layer of skills on top. So, first you have your offer, then you advertise your offer, then you monetize the offer. Now, it makes more sense when you think, oh, all three of these were one book. It was, but parsing them out like this made it better. The point that I wanted to prove when I started writing this stuff ages ago is that like I didn't have a brand when I did all the stuff that I did with Gym Launch. I didn't [music] have any of that. All I had was just skills. And so I thought if I can document these skills, then I can have [music] a visual demonstration of proof in real time that these skills when used properly can result [music] in a $100 million thing. The difficulty was going to be the props and the set because we have events, we have people, we have things that going on at our headquarters. For me to take the whole [music] main floor and basically sequester the whole thing for months would is not tenable. >> Yeah, Christian, if I'm if I'm spending all my time, >> I don't think you're going to use that. >> That's kind of my point. Yeah. >> Oh, great. Okay. So, that that helps. You only use those two during the presentation, then I would rather just make a dedicated camera just for this thing. >> Okay, great. We filled the rest of this out. I would rather put chat in the background with you because it still keeps their eyes on your frame. >> That's what I meant. But >> agreed. Yes. >> This is the thing you were talking about. This permanently [music] removes the glare at this angle. >> And so I really only got to do a few practice runs in the true setting. Basically like where will I move? What am I signaling? How's the camera like that? And I'd rather do like three or four like that and then I'll do a full Yeah. full a full run. Why are we putting so many curtains around where Alex is going to be? >> For a couple of reasons, but they all essentially boil down to making Alex in as controlled of an environment as humanly possible given the circumstances. So, this in entirely has to do with limiting distracting stimuli to keep Alex blind to as many things as humanly possible minus his slides honestly. So, he has zero clue what goes on with pretty much anything else going outside of this bubble. This is like right here says that's enough value. I'd be like, are you not entertained or is there even more? Everyone I know who's not in my like immediate circle has texted me been like, "So, looks like you're launching a book. Looks like you got a lot going on." [laughter] >> Good. >> Yeah. Great. >> I am kneede in just a bunch of different facets of the launch. You know, it's a few hours for everyone who shows up, but it's like multiple years of preparation that we're doing. And so, the entire team's, you know, working overtime to make this happen. >> We have built a team around the core values like competitive greatness. you see in those moments like who's actually made of the real [ __ ] like who leans into the challenge, who embraces it, who chases it. >> Most people only see this event as an event, but they don't realize that this event is being supported by an insane culture that is already existing in an operating business. Most people will just spin these teams up just to support an event, but you're not going to get the love, the care, the compassion to want to serve at that highest level. I don't think you can manufacture that. I just think it's super hard >> in position. >> Sh, you want to call it out? >> I'll call it. >> All right, perfect. >> Kind of feel it out. >> We'll do it like we would do it. Thank you, sir. >> All right, guys. rehearsal. You ready? You ready? All right, let's roll. I'm Alex Ramoszi. Welcome to my $100 million Money Models book launch event and we're going to try and break the world record together here live. So, I've got the Guinness judges right here. We're trying to break the single fastest selling non-fiction uh book in history uh in a single day. So, Prince Harry is the one who owns that record right now with 1.4 million copies uh for his book called Spirit which came out last year. Before that, I think it was Barack Obama's book which had come out, you know, many years before that. After that, it was Michelle Obama becoming I think it's like 750,000 copies. So, like big names with gigantic media behind them, literally like global globally recognized. And so, you know, I had to tell my team this, which is like we are trying to do something that literally no one has done before. And so, we should expect to do things that literally no one has done before in order to do it. >> How many days are we out? >> Uh, one day. One day. probably not even less less than 24 hours now, right? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. 20 hours. >> How do you feel? >> I feel so fabulous and excited. Yeah. >> We are doing sales support training for the $100 million Money Models launch. So, what you see here is a team of internal ACQ team members. Some of them are in sales, some of them are in our workshop teams. Really, we pulled from across the organization. And we are preparing to staff the phones for launch tomorrow. All right. [applause] >> Happy Friday. >> IT is train day number two. [screaming] >> WE are here. We are in day two role play one. So get ready to be creative as your customers. We really want to make sure that every single team member has a clear understanding of each offer and that they feel comfortable that they can concisely convey the value in a way that aligns with our brand standards. So really important just to make sure everyone feels super comfy going into tomorrow. We're really here because we want to help business owners irrespective of their size, scale, industry, origin. We are the team who can help literally anyone grow their business. So people will either have the option to buy one book of $100 million money models or they can buy the bundle. The bundle where you too can put this box in your hands and feel just how chunky it is. And my favorite part of this bundle is this scan me to scale faster. Where does this go? >> My calendar. [laughter] >> How much does the bundle cost? 598 98 >> cold stone cold. All right. Love it. 5998 is how much this is. >> One of the things I practiced the most was actually just going through the motions. So it's like I had to practice what that flow is going to be and do it over and over and over and over again so that when I'm actually live I'm not thinking what are my hands doing. So it's a lot like I think I don't play musical instrument but I would imagine that people who play the guitar and then sing it's similar where it's it's being able to do two things at once. And so I had to kind of like play the guitar while singing figuratively and I had to just do a lot of reps. >> That one's like >> No, that's Yeah, good. Yeah, I need I need speed. Need for speed. And I do like there's no ambiguity with this guy. That kind of that kind of speed. I have a need for speed. There's like hundreds of tiny things that I think people don't see and just had to be there. These are some decisions where we're going to have to live with the consequences cuz we can't do live again and we're not going to know what's going to happen. So, like, should we have the phone number up? When should we have it up? What phone number should it be? Should it just go to the CS team? Should it go to a sales team? All of those are decisions that were onetime decisions that we just had to make and just like hope we made the right call. >> What's up? >> What's up, team? >> How you doing? >> How's your trip? >> It's good. Alex is doing a run through downstairs. >> Oh, yeah. Do you want to go check it out? >> You can if you want. I just I' I've seen three drafts of it. So, Oh, >> okay. >> He wrote this first and then he was like, "Hey, this is missing two other pieces. I'm going to do the offers." And then the offers had no launch and then the leads had the launch. Cuz if you release the money models without the offers and the leads, they're like, "Wait a minute. I don't know how to do those things." You could have argued that you could have released it either way, but this is the most valuable book. >> If someone thinks, "Oh, this could help me double my business." It's very easy. I'm not saying we promise that, but I'm saying it was very easy to justify the expense within a B2B context. The issue is no one believes you. If I said I can double your business, if you believe me, then it makes sense. I wanted the entire event in the leadup to the event to exist as proof. The best way to get someone to believe is to have already done it. Proof above everything. >> Okay. >> It looks good, right? Everything's okay, is it? >> Oh, yeah. It's got the timer and everything. We try the test of the stream. >> Yep. [ __ ] yeah. >> The stream. >> I don't know about the stream. >> Can we ask him? >> Yeah. Yeah, I'll do that. >> Or like ideally he should send you the stream link and then you should watch it through the stream to make sure like the audio is good >> that like it doesn't get muted cuz um Amir told me if it gets muted it's like it [ __ ] the stream. >> Everyone's like on edge right now. [laughter] >> I have a terrible fear that the that the cursing in the promo video will have the stream get listed as 18 plus. Whatever anxiety about that, multiply times 1,000. That's >> Oh, good. >> Face noises create so many problems. >> How you feeling? >> Um, like my career's on the line >> in the best and worst way possible. >> Rather than like, how do we win? It's like, well, how would we fail? >> Mhm. >> And okay, there's six ways that this could fail. How do we prevent every single way from failing? >> Here are the choke points as I see them in order and we'll find out after we're watching this if I missed one. But one is if for some reason um the social media platforms throttle our ability to spend money on advertising. Sometimes it happens um like if we can't advertise the event, the event's not going to be able to be as big, which means we're not going to break the record. Okay, so drama of the day. [music] At approximately 3 hours ago, um 4 hours ago, I was selfishly sleeping and [music] our Google Ads account got down. So the plan now is to pivot, just reroute the budget towards Meta. And if that doesn't work, we'll rout it towards TikTok. If that doesn't work, we'll regrow it towards LinkedIn ads, whatever we need to do. >> The next choke point is going to be emails [music] and texts. >> Doing some last minute checks on the main announcement email. We also have the SMS that's about to go out as well. And this is the number one most important action I'd say of today aside from everything else. Uh is make sure that this sends they're firing. >> The next choke point is where people click the link. So if they click the link, we have to make sure the link works. >> We checked all the links yesterday and like a bunch of them are broken. >> The fourth choke point is going to be we have to make sure that Shopify can process payments. >> Our Shopify link was sending people to Serbia. Those are all of the choke points as I see them. We will find out if there's new ones that I did not know about. Uh, and yeah, we'll find out. >> Okay. 5 minutes. 5 minutes. >> 5 minutes right here. >> Okay. >> When we're selling, stay slow. I want to stay calm and I want to help the person make the purchase. We're making history here. >> This is insane. >> Let's go. >> What's going to happen? It's going to go great. >> Breakers. >> We're about to break some records. >> Break records, baby. >> Very excited. >> We're about to make a lot of money for a lot of business owners. >> Either it's going to go really well, which was a plan. So, just follow the plan. And if it's not going well, well, maybe it hasn't had time to let the plan happen yet or work yet. So, just follow the plan. >> It's launch, dude. >> It's launch. It's launched. >> [ __ ] go. >> All right. So, the rumors are true. >> Yeah, baby. >> All right. >> All right, guys. Everybody, everybody quiet on set. >> We're going live in five, four, >> three. Let's just >> It's time. [screaming] >> The $100 million Money Models Book Launch is finally here. >> Welcome to the stage, Alex. >> [music] >> You guys are awesome. You guys are awesome. Thank you guys. Camera's ready. Audio ready. >> Lights ready. >> Are you guys ready? >> Yes. >> All right. I'm Alex Ramoszi and welcome to my $100 million Money Models book launch event and we're going to try and break world record together here live. So, I've got the Guinness judges right here. Britney, I want you to come on out. Britney's going to make sure that we check boxes and do the things to uh make this legit. Thank you so much, Britney. We all thank you. So, it's going to be a wild ride and you guys are going to want to buckle up because it's going to get exciting. With a $100 million money model, you can get really big, really profitable, really fast. $31 million of consulting work went into this. It's yours for free. You donate 200 bucks. And I made donating super easy by hiring and training 300 plus phone reps to help anyone out who has issues checking out. >> The massive value that you're going to get is not just the sales and marketing stuff. >> So, did you get a chance to check out all the offers that Alex mentioned in the live? I know. I saw you had texted us back and you said you saw that. >> A money model is a sequence of offers. >> Is there anything else that I can answer for you as well? >> Ship to Puerto Rico. >> We're about to push for 100 million in one weekend. I'm feeling awesome. It's been a been a blast. This is the most we've ever worked, but it's worth every second. >> Big dog Shiron >> 200, baby. Appreciate you guys. It's so fun. Yeah. So fun. We just cracked 200,000. >> This is the VIP chat. Uh, so someone has to moderate that probably. >> There's There's several people. >> Oh my god. >> It's all pretty positive in the chat. >> Big boom. >> Big boom. >> I looked at those days as like boot camp for our culture. >> I was talking to somebody and and they were like, I'm not afraid to work hard. And I think nobody should feel afraid to work hard because of what's possible when you do. >> Still running 577 [music] 578. We may hit this. >> If for 3 days we work harder than we've worked in years, we can break [music] the world record. >> These guys are the pros, >> dude. Let's go. >> Got something else for you here. I want to show the world that one of us can start from nothing and achieve anything we put our hearts and minds to. >> Did I say that I wrote just one book inside? >> I personally deliver the recommendations. I document their exact problems and [music] solutions. >> It's from acquisition.com on recorded live. >> Here's what I would also offer. >> That's perfect. >> Thank you so much. Enjoy. >> Thank you to all the players for putting books in the hands of entrepreneurs who need them. You guys are all amazing. The whole team was like, "This is awesome." Everyone's like super gung-ho on like, "We want to break this record. We want to break history together." >> Well, hey, I'm super excited for you. Thanks for doing business with us. >> We're at 1,000 books a second right now. It's not slowing down. It's 1,000 books a second. This is crazy. >> This playbook gives you the exact process we follow to break through ad spend ceilings and keep scaling. So, here's just a fraction of what's inside. Holy [ __ ] >> This is crazy. >> Honestly, I think in the moment I was just feeling like, "Oh, fuck." Like, it's working, >> dude. We might break the record. >> 1.4. >> I think I feel like there's a chance to identify which conraint would be the best ever. Our most effective framework to help you use ACQA to find and create leverage. >> [ __ ] pinpoint your bott. >> Wow. It's just so rare that the stars all align. >> Can you get me access to Leila's office to talk to her? >> Okay. >> So, if we can get the book dude here during the stream, I will interrupt the stream to present the the world record award during the stream. >> I could bring them up with me and be like, I have something. >> Yes. >> I think that'd be good. I'd be like, I have a special guest. >> Okay. >> Here to tell you something. >> Yes. What is the least important thing that I'm spending time and money on? Am I willing to trade that for this other thing that I want more? If the answer is yes, I make the trade. >> Number one, baby. Let's go. >> Guinness World Record broken. >> Wow. could not be more proud of Alex, Leila, the entire team because the sheer amount of work that has gone into this, the every single detail that's that's gone into this launch is what makes him amazing. I thought it would be cool to disrupt him in real time and [music] just like tell him that it happened because I also think when you're up there performing, knowing that your performance resulted in a result that you want, it can alleviate some of that tension that you have and it can also make you want to keep going. So, I think it's really really motivating to know that you've won. Like winning makes you want to keep winning. that little bit. >> And so whenever I like to think of my situation, if I think it's hard, there's always someone who's had it worse and done better. With that being said, let me bring up our next mystery headliner. >> Actually, >> okay. >> We are interrupting. >> Okay. >> Because I brought some friends. >> Oh. >> To give you something. >> No [ __ ] >> You broke the record. [laughter] >> You broke the record. [applause] >> Hi, Alex. As you know, this record is continuing for 24 hours. So, it is quite an official [laughter] officially amazing achievement to have surpassed the record already so soon into the 24-hour launch. >> So, we will get that final number um tomorrow morning and see where your final number is, but we can confirm the three of us that you are the official new record holder. Congratulations. >> Thank you. [applause] >> Well, [ __ ] Oh, sorry. I'm not supposed to cuss my bed. Well, uh, shoot. The idea of putting a book in the in every entrepreneur's hands in America was something that was really dear to me because, um, this was like everything I have is because of of things I've learned and because of other people who decided to write it down. And I thought, man, if I bought a if I built a brand that was like everything instead of instead of trying to hide it, just like just put everything out there, all the details and just build a brand based on that. And so, this is really a word for you guys. Thank you guys so much. You guys are awesome. And thank you guys so much. >> Of course. So, just so you guys know, the I think the record was 1.44, something like that. >> 1.43. >> Yeah. 1.43 million copies sold. Um, we're serious. We want to get the books into the into the hands of uh as many entrepreneurs in America as we can. And, you know, we're not stopping. So, let's keep powering through. I got more stuff to show you. And, um, I can't wait. [music] Thank you guys. Thank you. >> All right. >> Congratulations. >> We did it. We did it. >> We just dethrowned Prince Harry. [laughter] >> [music] [applause and music] [cheering] >> Great. We broke it and now we have three more days. You know what I mean? And I'm going to go hard. As much as I do want to like quick celebrate, we got hours left. 100 million to go. We perfect end the $100 million series. We broke the record. We got the Guinness thing. We got the W, but we had a bigger W to get. [applause] >> Most people that were a part of this, including Alex, did not wake up 3 years ago thinking we were going to go after the Guinness Book of World Records. But I think it shows that almost anything is achievable. >> What's up, guys? >> Congratulations. >> This is not a book launch. This is a chance to reimagine how we live our lives. That the underdog actually won. And we are all the underdog. >> Like the job's almost done. Not done yet. >> Not done yet. >> Why? Why not done yet? >> We still got to hit 100 million. >> 100 million sales. >> Yeah. Let's [ __ ] go. >> $100 million money model. You have to make 100 million. [laughter] >> We're not slowing down now. >> We just started. >> Even if you have the thing to sell, offers, and the people to sell it to, leads, you still have another question to answer. How do you get them to give you money? >> It's [ __ ] 2 mill before lunch. I've been working with this guy since >> March and he's trying to buy 10,000 books right now for his community. >> How's everything going? How's the launch going? >> It's going very well. It's going very well. It's It's Yeah, it's pretty crazy. >> The sales team is too fast. I can't take calls cuz the sales team is too fast. >> Confirmed 10,000 bucks. >> That's awesome. >> Thank you. Thank you. >> Just seeing the team just rally and just rage to make this happen. [music] I would say like most people were like I have not enjoyed working more than this and they also worked more than any of them had ever done in their lives and it was also worth it. >> Outside of that our teams can give you the blueprint so that you can collapse the curve and actually have that result right now. If if that alone can be worth it, would would that protect the downside for you? I'll sort this out for you and then in 30 minutes um we give you a call back and we can figure that out. Basically, we called until we couldn't call anymore. Then we went into calling Australia because they were just waking up. >> That is my shoe. This is for my Aussies. I promised I would uh do a Shy for you guys since you guys are showing up at like 2:00 in the morning. Aussies, this is for you. You guys are awesome. The size and scope of all of this to me was not about the money, but it was about the impact. It's about that so many people around were one willing to invest in a book and two willing to donate more so that more people can win. [sighs and gasps] There's never been a time in history where someone has done something for somebody else to help beat a world record. That is super cool. So now every [music] single person that helped invest in this, donate and buy a book was a part of history. We have 3 [music] hours before the Guinness World Record deadline closes to sell as many as we can. And so we're going to try to push for it. No rest for the weary. >> Picking the associations that you want to make is one of the one of the clearest decisions that you have to make for the brand so that you can ultimately build the brand that your [music] customers want to buy from and tell their friends about. >> Broke three million. We both launched sales support. Christine made it official. We had 100 million. We're $100 million. >> Before the 24 hours end, >> we got a solid 45 minutes left. >> Judge from Guinness is in there right now. We have half an hour before the world record window closes. And so she's basically looking through all of our Shopify backend data to verify the final number. >> Let's go, Lena. >> 18K. 18K up. >> Why work around [music] the clock for something like this? What else would you work around the clock for? >> What a [music] surreal day. >> It costs so much, you know, work and money and time to to do the $100 million launch, but like how elegant is it to have the $100 million series with a $100 million launch culminating with a book about monetization to demonstrate the ideas that the concepts inside the book work. >> Just a chill day at the office. >> Yeah. just took down the three presidents of the first lady and the prince. [laughter] >> History was made. People are going to be talking about this for years to come and we're going to be able to say we're part of that magic. >> I think sometimes [music] people lack motivation not because their goals are too big but because they're too small. It has to be big enough to excite us or why bother? >> Yeah. >> [music] [music] >> Heat. Heat.
