# 5 AI Habits Winners vs Losers

Liam Ottley discusses the transformative habits that will set apart successful AI users from those who fall behind.

## Core Thesis
By 2026, the divide among AI users will be stark, with the top 1% leveraging advanced AI techniques to significantly enhance productivity and business success. Embracing voice technology, automating tasks, and integrating AI into daily operations will differentiate the "winners" from the "losers" in the AI landscape.

## Key Insights
- The shift from keyboard to voice input will dominate, massively increasing productivity.
- Chat interfaces will consolidate multiple applications, reducing context switching.
- Resistance to automation creates inefficiency; those neglecting AI risk falling behind.
- Non-technical users can now build applications through accessible AI tools, shifting power towards small business owners.
- AI will streamline commerce, saving time and money for those who utilize it effectively.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Embrace voice technology by transitioning from typing to voice input.
2. Consolidate applications into chat interfaces to streamline workflows.
3. Begin using AI to automate repetitive tasks and explore vibe coding for app development.
4. Consider providing AI consulting services to cater to business demand.
5. Prepare for agentic commerce by integrating AI into shopping processes.

## Notable Quotes
> "By the end of 2026, the most productive and successful people are barely going to be touching their keyboard anymore."
