long-term relationships they require a calmer slower Pace to actually build the trust you know the the reciprocity the time spent together that actually leads to real friendships real relationships and what I see now is that they're not building friendships they can actually rely [Music] on Matthew where does this podcast find you at Los Angeles I'm uh in Beverly Grove so let's talk about your new book love life how to raise your standards find your person and live happily no matter what can you walk us through what led you to write this I I I wrote this book it's called love life um I suppose I wrote it partly because I hadn't written a book in over 10 years uh the last book I wrote was about 11 years ago and it was a very different book it was more kind of I I suppose on some level on the Strategic or tactical side of how to go out there and find someone um but this book really addressed some of the bigger reasons why we might struggle to do that why all the all the advice in the world that relates to dating can fail us when there are just fundamental obstacles getting in our way in either the way that our life is structured in the mindset we bring to it in the frankly the trauma we bring to the table when we go out there and date the the internal blockages the continuing to go for what is familiar instead of what's actually going to make us happier and so this this book attempts to address those while also addressing the reality that life doesn't always go the way that we had hoped and it often doesn't and people find themselves single at a time in their lives they never assumed they would be single never dreamt they would still have not found kind of person or love that they'd been looking for or come out of a a second marriage at you know 65 and are going oh my God what happened you know how how am I finding myself alone right now and and and for the people that had never been married and had never found that and are finding that they've spent their whole lives with a kind of chronic pain of loneliness uh anxiety uh sadness or depression around not having a fulfilling love life so I wrote this book to deal with hard questions really uh and and hard things that people go through as much as the dream of finding what we want to find what do you think are some of the macro the or the environmental factors that have resulted in it seems like there is a crisis of loneliness a lack of household formation but in general it feels like loneliness especially men but across both genders is kind of a the lack of better term epidemic uh levels what are the what are the atmospherics that have caused that and what are some of the solutions or personal behaviors you would recommend so I whatever issues people have with finding it harder to make friends the older they get which I think is a real issue I think that there are certain structures that we are kind of forced into a age you know if people go to college then you're forced into a social structure and you meet people and every year after that it tends to get harder for people I mean some for some people it's easier especially starting a new job is a chance at a new community although it's still one related to your work but it's still a chance to go if you even work in a building anymore it's a chance to go to a building where there are other people there and potentially meet people um but outside of starting new jobs a lot of people I talk to don't have any forced structure where they're going to meet new people in new in this decade of their life whether it's their 30s 40s 50s 60s and so I think increasingly we have to have the the proactivity and the impetus to engineer those structures ourselves um and that's a hard thing to do one of the things I love that you I heard you talk about Scott is just this idea that when you're talking about men they're staying at home and and they're not in the world you know they are they're not building the robustness that comes from Simply stepping outside their front door and being in teams in groups in situations where they can meet strangers and I think that's true for a lot of women as well women typically from everything I've ever seen have empirically a much easier time staying connected to friends and being part of social groups with them friends than guys do but on both sides it's so much easier to stay home now and by the way all the changes in dating and Tech in dating have made that easier again cuz at least dating used to finding love used to be a motivator in getting out of the house and that might be something that forced us into situations where we had to meet with other people but nowadays you know you don't even have to leave the house for that so human behavior is always going to Trend towards what's most comfortable what's the path of least resistance and that's what people are able to do in dating as well as every other path I see these days and dopamine I think also plays a huge role in the problems that people are experiencing because the addiction that we have to our phones the addiction that we have to constant hits of attention or novelty and I'm I'm not just talking about the areas where directly social like liking getting people to like our Instagram posts or getting a match on Tinder even just the dopamine cycle we're in of constant stimulation that has nothing to do with our social life I think is a real problem for building relationships because it we're just wired these days for that kind of novelty and instant gratification and friendships attraction long-term relationships they require a calmer slower Pace to actually build the trust the you know the the reciprocity the time spent together that actually leads to real friendships real relationships and what I see now is that people have so many superficial connections but they're just they're not building friendships they can actually rely on they're building lots a network of people they can show off to but they're not building the relationships that when they're having a terrible time in life when things when the really hits the fan and they need someone to talk to they don't necessarily have an abundance of those people in their lives and a lot of the ones they do have are unhealthy relationships they're not supportive how has online dating impacted um um how people meet like what's your what's your view on online dating and um I my sense is it's it's impacted men and women differently what are your thoughts hm I'd love to hear I'd love to hear your thoughts on that I online dating has made it easier for people to get that dopamine hit that I was talking about but it's made it harder to for many people to get to the point of actually getting to know someone actually having any real moment of social interaction you know the number of people I speak to that get locked into cycles of speaking to someone for weeks or months where it's just a texting Dynamic there's there's no M you know how many people never even get to the point of a date with someone that they are seeing in an online environment you know I say seeing in quotes because the real danger I see with so many people and I see this time and again is we are not present with the reality of our actual lives and relationships especially in our love lives we are more concerned with the fantasy of what could be online dating gives us ample kind of uh fodder for those stories without necessarily training us to be disciplined and ruthless about actually focusing on people that present as real prospects and people I see people people waste years or even Decades of their life on those stories and time is time is ticking the whole time we're spending 6 months in a like quote situationship with someone who's not progressing there six months you'll never get back um so that I see that a lot on the on the women's side I'm curious to to know what you are seeing on the men's side and how it presents differently well with men it's so women have much finer filter than men and also there's more men on these apps so what this all distills down to is that a man of average attractiveness on an app has to swipe right 200 times to get one match and so for men who are kind of in the bottom 90 online dating is pretty humiliating and so you have this kind of Porsche polygamy effect online where the top 10% of men get an abundance of opportunity and the bottom 90 get almost none and so it feels like women are all kind of pursuing the same guy and those guys who get an abundance of attention it doesn't incentivize them to behave well and then the bottom 90 are just very frustrated and upset and start you know going going to Dark Places you you said something that struck me in your book and I really like this you said we have to be wary of the instinct to transfer the importance we feel for the position we are looking to fill to a new person who only might one day fill it and I was thinking about my own personal experience with dating and that is whenever I've become a little too obsessed as the wrong word because it's never taken over my life but infatuated with someone it wasn't about that person it was about where I was in my life at that moment that I wanted something that was going to take me away and I Envision this new life because I wasn't enjoying my current life and the prospect of this person or being in relationship with this person filled that vessel that opportunity to do something differently anyways say more about what you meant here well I I I love what you just said the you know I think when we're not when we're trying to derive our source from something or someone else then you know we we can't afford to lose it and and I do think the more we find ways to create that Source from within or you know even just from more diverse external sources so that it that you know in the book I I get people to kind of as an exercise draw what i' call an identity Matrix of all of the different things that make up the identity they've constructed for themselves and I know on a mindfulness level that would be seen as just all being a problem because any any kind of identity we take from anywhere is makes us vulnerable and and of course that's true but that doesn't mean it isn't wise to diversify the sources of confidence and identity in our lives and you know that's why for people who have hobbies that they love or creative Endeavors that they derive purpose from um or careers that that they you know derive an enormous amount of satisfaction from or friends and family relationships they are diversifying the sources of their confidence um and that's a very powerful thing now romantically there's always going to be this incredible draw to that square in our identity Matrix uh and you know for so many people I would argue universally whatever form it comes in we are looking for love we want that feeling of having a mate we want that feeling of being attractive to the people we're trying to attract um we want to feel fulfilled in our love lives so that desire to find that becomes so in some case is anxiously driven especially when time is running out or it feels like time is running out that's true from on a very literal level for everyone who's looking for a family of their own biologically um and for women more than men although for for men too more than a lot of them realize that that fear of time running out amplifies this feeling of God I have this really important position that I want to fill in my life um I I'm trying to fill the position of my life partner and we get so obsessed with how important it is to fill that position that the moment we go on a date and we you see even the faintest hope that this person could represent a a candidate for that position which by the way Scott normally is not based on any deeper character traits cuz how many of people's deeper character traits can we really ascertain on a 1 hour first date usually it's based on the fact that they were Charming or they were charismatic or they kind of you know swept us off our feet a little bit or you know they made us feel really good about ourselves in that hour or they were sexy or they had the body shape we're attracted to we see those things and our brain kind of lights up and goes oh this could be it this could be that person and all of a sudden in this very subtle but Insidious move all of the importance of the role we're trying to fill suddenly gets shifted over to this person sitting across the dinner table from us and then you know week in we're wondering why am I obsessed how I'm obsessed with this person and we you know cognitive dissonance I think makes us tell a story about why we're obsessed like no I'm obsessed because I really do feel an amazing connection with this person I I haven't felt this in a long time and we try to tell ourselves a rational story about why this person we just met is instantly so important to us but the reality I think is one we have to confront in order to actually let the air out of that balloon in a healthy way which is that I do not know this person um all I know is their impact at this stage I don't know their character much as in a job interview you know I I I don't know about you Scott I've been humbled by you know I've always thought I'm an incredible judge of character I really am I'm great at judging character and then you know I I hire someone for a role because in the first hour I thought this person's incredible they're going to do wonders for our company and then 6 months later I I'm humbled by how wrong I was it's very hard to tell and so the the idea of oh I know this person from this first hour is is just it's an arrogance a lot of us have the truth is character is consistent and consistency can only be measured over time we'll be right back if you could give men and women or maybe it's different for each a a of kind of one or two best practices or behavioral modifications that would increase the likelihood they might end up in a healthy relationship what what are those one or two things you know I think firstly set your path before you go out there into dating because otherwise you you're going to be swept away by whatever is the shiniest thing not by someone that's actually aligned with your values not that someone presents as someone who's going to make your life better now and in the future you know we've all seen men and women attracted to sex appeal charm Charisma in a violent way where that just becomes everything to get that person and secure that person without ever really assessing am I really going to want the thing that I'm working hard to get and there are plenty of marriages that people end up in where they find that oh I got the person now what does my life look like with this person and it's like that actually becomes a secondary question in the equation and it should be the primary question before all of our the chemicals kick in that make us suddenly run head first into a situation that brings us an enormous amount of pain and suffering and sometimes are very hard to extricate ourselves from especially when our life becomes in meshed with a person like that so first decide what is valuable to me and one of the ways to decide that is to is looking backwards most people myself included can look at a relationship where they overvalued the wrong thing and undervalued the right thing and as a result were miserable I remember a relationship where I was trying desperately to hold on and to keep this situation this person and yet it was making me miserable and I was terrified that if I lost it I would be in hell but the truth is I was already in Hell by being in it I was just telling myself that if I could just secure it then I'll be okay I'll be happy and and it I was missing something fundamental you know teamwork loyalty a a trust a feeling that I mattered a feeling that I was seen um that there was equal investment on both sides I didn't have them those things and so I was an anxious wreck in that relationship I was like a version of me that I look back on now and I cringe I'm like oh my God that was that really brought out the worst in me in every way so when we Look Backwards we can often see a relationship where we were told ourselves it was important to us and yet we were missing something crucial and by missing that crucial thing it became hell if we remember those situations and the thing that the ingredient we were missing that made miserable well it stands to reason that that ingredient should be the number one priority going forward and yes we still want attraction yes we still want some chemistry yes we still want some of those things that light us up but importantly if we find those things but we don't have that ingredient we don't bother because we know when we had all those things last time around but we didn't have that ingredient we could not find a way to be happy we were just in constant suffering and we should not wish that on our future selves so that's uh one big important thing I do think we have to look practically at the areas where our ego is maybe driving us too much instead of our happiness you know often we want the person who we can bring to our friends and family and everyone's going to Pat us on the back and celebrate us and tell us we did great but usually that's based on a lot of superficial things or you know the way that person walks in and charms everyone it's often not based on the deeper things that make us really happy so I think we really have to tune into what's going to make me happy and what's going to bring me peace what's going to bring me calm what's going to bring me a better life not who do I bring to my friends and family and everyone says you did great or we show a picture and everyone's like ah good job buddy like those are that's us being driven by ego so I think we have to be very careful if we're being driven by what egoic satisfies us or what actually makes us happier happy on a deeper level and also look for areas where you're addicted to a certain feeling that you keep telling yourself is happiness or you keep telling yourself is like the Great Stuff went romantically when actually it's just it's just a feeling you've become addicted to over time and you can find examples of this in different places in your life I remember the realization that when I was late to things I kept asking I kept I would get annoyed at myself when I would show up late and I would go why am I late like there was no reason for me to be late today why am I late to this thing and part of it I realized was oh I'm addicted to the feeling of rushing somewhere like there's something adrenaline seeking about leaving a too late and then having to get there on time and all the that frantic energy is something that I was used to I was used to chaos in my life so I would even if I was on time unconsciously I would always find a way to engineer needing to then Rush at the last minute and so it took me away from calm because calm to me presented as kind of boring getting somewhere 5 minutes early and and then just sitting with my thoughts that was a that was like boring and uncomfortable whereas rushing to get there was adrenaline and so you can apply that to any relationship in your life and so I would I would invite people I don't think this is an easy process it's certainly not a simple process or even an intuitive process but I would invite people into the process of looking at feelings you keep chasing that really don't serve you jump you know going on Instagram and scrolling for a few minutes will give you a feeling but it 99 times out of a 100 nothing about visiting Instagram is going to serve you um so what's the feeling we're chasing and do we need to start chasing feelings and experiences that create a better quality of life for us and that that's a harder question and it might take us some time to even calm our nervous system down from the feelings we're used to uh I mean if you take a drug addict and you know the day they quit you sit them in front of a Sunset and ask them to appr appreciate a sunset that's going to be a difficult moment for them to take in the beauty of a sunset but you know months or or or or or years later they may truly have the ability to sit there and go wow this is amazing I just but my body needed to you know physiologically there needed to be a a a period of kind of detoxing from that Old experience in order to truly appreciate a new one and so for some people the answer might be stop dating for a while and detox from that some for some people it might be have some have a real sit with yourself and start to write down what do I value now and let me let me be wary that the old feeling is still going to be exciting to me and I'm still going to feel the drug of that and that's the dangerous part and I have to respect the drug I have to respect what it does to me but I have to train my focus to the to the kinds of people and relationships that make my life better not worse Matthew hessy is a leading dating expert and confidence coach he's also a podcast host and the New York Times bestselling author of love life how to
