I'm just very curious to get your view on the role that age and this presidential race is going to play age is absolutely a legitimate issue to talk about and it's important to talk about it with both candidates and I worry a little bit that those of us in the media talking so much about Joe Biden's age in particular that we come to make it seem like the only issue in this [Music] election David where does this podcast find you uh Washington DC you live in DC yeah how long have you lived in DC oh my goodness 15 years oh wow 16 years I did not know that no one knows it because I I'm a New Yorker and I work for a company that has New York in the name there you go so let's start kind of meadow distill down if you can what you believe is going on in the US economy right now so there's a lot of discussion about um how good is the US economy are Americans irrational for being being unhappy with the economy and in a shortterm sense I think that's an important debate and a fair debate and there are some ways in which people are maybe a little bit more pessimistic than the economic numbers warant but in the big picture um our economy has been disappointing for most Americans for much of the last half century you can see that if you look at wage statistics you can see that if you look at wealth or net worth statistics you can see that if you look at all kinds of measures of social well-being like the percent of kids who grow up with two parents the percent of people who spend time behind bars at some point in their life the percent of people who suffer chronic pain you can see it in the polls how Americans feel not just in this current moment but about the country's Direction and then in some ways to me the the single most important and most alarming statistic is that in the 1960s and70s and even into the early 1980s the United States had a normal life expectancy for a rich country and for the last 15 years or so we have had the lowest life expectancy of any rich country lower than Canada lower than any country in western Europe lower than Japan or South Korea or Australia and so I think in a really basic way our economy and our society isn't working for huge numbers of people particularly people who don't have four-year college degrees so I'm reminded of the William Gibson quote that the future is here it's just not evenly distributed I think that's a decent way to describe the economy that Prosperity or unprecedented Prosperity is here it's just not evenly distributed would you agree with that yes the only thing I would add is if if you're not if you're not receiving the distribution um it's less important that in some theoretical sense unprecedented Prosperity is here but I absolutely agree with you that given the Bounty that our economy produces uh we could have an economy that works really well for huge numbers of people the fact that we don't is not a small detail or a footnote not that you're suggesting it is but in some ways it's the main story well it's outrageous I mean Nvidia is now worth almost as much as the German stock market but one in five households have food insecurity I mean it's just sort of it only makes your point that much more Stark right yeah so I'll put forward a thesis and you respond to it that we are moving to Hunger Games economy where we the number of billionaires in the last 10 years is quintupled and because Americans are such Optimist we believe that our kid is going to be the billionaire so we don't and Al also the incumbents corporations and the wealthy are very sophisticated in terms of getting over represented in Washington DC and we've just seen a massive crowding effect of the spoils into the top 1% am I am I oversimplifying it no I think that's that's right we have seen that um and although the 1% is a useful cut off we've seen even more of a crowding to the top 0.1 or 01 and we've seen some crowding to the top 10% right and so um we really have seen a huge increase in in inequality I I one of the things that I this is a book of History um it's a book of stories um much more so than a book of of of Economics or numbers um and I end up with a with a core criticism of both the political right and the political left in our country and they are two different very different criticisms I think the political right about 50 years ago Ronald Reagan being the key figure offered this prescription for what ailed our economy in the 1970s and it wasn't a crazy prescription our economy really was struggling in the 70s and Reagan and the people around him came along and they said look if we cut taxes particularly for rich people and we shrink labor unions and we shrink regulation and we let companies get really big and we move toward this neoliberal economy it'll be better for everyone and it hasn't been I mean you and I just went through the statistics whether it's on income or wealth or life expectancy this economy really for decades hasn't been working very well for huge numbers of Americans and we see parts of the Republican party start to question that LE Fair model but for the most part the dominant Economic Policy of the Republican party is still this economic policy that really hasn't worked that well for most people and then on the left we have a lot of Democrats who say why is it that these workingclass people are so irrational that they won't come and support our party because we believe in different economic ideas and that is true but it's also true that the Democratic party has increasingly become a party of college graduates and relatively affluent professionals and has adopted a whole set of policies on other issues immigration arguably the number one one right now in the debate that really are alienating to huge numbers of working-class people and for a while Democrats said well that's because those people are ignorant and they're hateful and they're racist I think that was obviously racism plays a big role in American politics but I think it was wrong to suggest it was all that in five or 10 years ago and it's clearly wrong now because we have seen substantial numbers of Voters of color move away from the Democratic Party In The Last 5 Years mostly workingclass voters who look at the Democratic party and say that's not a party I want to be a part of and when you put these two things together neither of our parties reflects the interests and the values of working-class people and is out there trying to create an economy that works better for them so let's start there an economy that works better for more people what do you think are some of the building blocks of restoring or greater distribution of the this immense Prosperity I think labor unions are really important and I'm a bit self-critical on that I've been writing about the economy at the New York Times for most of the last 25 years and I don't think I've paid enough attention to labor unions now labor unions are not perfect I have been in a labor union and at times been frustrated to I manage people in labor unions in a labor union I understand that labor unions can sometimes um be an impediment to important change but when you look at the history and the research the dominant experience is that labor unions lift the wages of workers and um they don't cause companies to go out of business they instead basically redistribute money that would go to top Executives and to shareholders and instead increase the wages of workers and yes labor unions are flawed but so are corporations and when you don't have flawed labor unions checking the power of flawed corporations you end up with the kind of Highly unequal economy that we had in the 1920s and that we have had for the last few decades so I want to unpack that and I'm I'm generally opening open to learning here I think the intention the stated goals kind of the G Gestalt of unions and labor are positives my issue is that 46 of the 47 countries that have unions have seen their membership decline dramatically union membership here has been cut in half the bottom line is by most metrics America just doesn't buy into unions and unless you can have a union that represents a majority of workers in an industry in a in a in a large region you have a race to the bottom and that is states that are anti-union end up attracting more business and there's a lower tax base and fewer jobs for those Union towns it just and let me Pro propose a a solution there should be one Union and it should be the federal government and we should raise minimum wage to 25 bucks a share maybe some exceptions for exceptionally low low uh income or low cost of living regions all the the the the the the admirable aims they don't work as a construct I'm a little more optimistic for a few reasons one if you look at polling huge numbers of Americans say they would like to be part of a labor union labor unions have higher approval now in polling than they've had it in decades it's true that many of them struggle to join unions um but the fact that there aren't unions isn't isn't on its face that there couldn't be there also weren't labor unions in the 19s and 20s um and then government policy changed and and the share of workers and unions changed and then to your point about this sort of Race To The Bottom we've had an interesting change in our economy that most people recognize but they don't necessarily recognize why it can lead to a larger share of organized labor our economy is increasingly a service economy right it's less a Manufacturing economy it used to be and it's more a service economy that's not going to change so if your fear is that hey if that factory unionizes in Pennsylvania or Michigan um a rival company or that company can just move to a non-union State like Alabama or can move to a much lower wage country like in Latin America or say Vietnam and then just make the same product um and undercut the union wages so even if you have that concern think about just how much of our eon now that doesn't apply to so your local Starbucks can't move to another state or another country and still be your local Starbucks your local hospital can't move to another state or another country and still be your local hospital the Amazon warehouse that serves your community can't move to another state or another country and still be your local warehouse and so in a service economy it is much harder for companies to Simply get around unions by leaving the area and if we had different Federal policy I actually think that a service economy makes it possible to have a meaningfully larger share of workers represented by unions and able to take advantage of collective bargaining than we now do I think it's a compelling argument wouldn't it be more efficient to just take minimum wage if minimum wage are kept up with productivity I mean here's what we've had the last 40 years we've had unbelievable gains and productivity workers haven't shared in it their wages have gone flat productivity is up to the right and the gap between the two is literally trillions of dollars in stakeholder value that is ACC Creed to shareholders and the top one if not the top .1% so the question is how do we shove more money into the lower 99 quite frankly and it would be good for the economy they spend the money you know the 1% invests which brings interest rates and cost of capital down and you could argue they're more efficient they do crazy things like build rockets and and endow you know new wings at universities with their names on it there's some good to that but it's not as good as putting more money in the in the pockets of middle class lower-income people because they spend it all it's sort of stimulus right the multiplier effect is greater so if that's the goal and we all agree that that makes sense wouldn't it be more efficient to just have again 23 or $25 an hour minimum wage or some sort of negative income tax where everyone makes $10,000 no matter what and if you make zero you get a tax rebate of$ 10,000 and if you make you know and you figure out some sort of some sort of sliding scale that gives people the motivation to work but have it be for you have a Social Security number you're in a union right technically wouldn't that be a more efficient way than trying to because for all you talked about Starbucks I'll use that as an example 300 Starbucks have unionized have voted to unionized is my understanding but not one has come to an collective bargaining agreement and so for all the talk about this great Resurgence of unions it's not it's not having any much impact as far as I can tell the oh I agree but I think we would need changes in federal law basically so that what happens now is a Starbucks uh store unionizes and Starbucks basically refuses to negotiate with them they somehow find violations by the people who helped organize the union um uh and they let them go but but federal law could change and could basically say look when workers unionize companies really have to recognize them and and and work with them so the fact that that hasn't happened so far to me it could still happen we do need changes in federal law for it happen on your point about minimum wage look I think a higher minimum wage would have t of benefits but it is a minimum wage it isn't going to have that much of an effect on middle class people and so we can raise the floor but I don't see how a minimum wage or a higher earned income tax credit can help working class and middle class people nearly as much as labor unions do because what we're talking about now are someone who right now might be you know earning $40 an hour but actually because of their productivity should be earning $50 an hour um uh that isn't something that a a minimum wage is is going to address a minimum wage and eitc are really good for helping lower income people and we should help lower income people they're less good at helping workingclass and middle class people so labor or renewed strength or maybe laws that make it easier to unionize that's one solution talk about some other Solutions or recommendations um I think in investment is enormously important investment defined really broadly so private sector investment as you just noted is really important we need companies um investing in things that are going to help in the long term but there are a whole set of things that the private sector on its own doesn't tend to invest enough in the private sector doesn't tend to in invest enough in basic research and development because it's impossible to know how to profit from that in the moment right there's a reason that the federal government built the internet there's a reason that the federal government uh essentially financed the entire early computer industry in this country because at the very beginning it was hard to know exactly who would profit from it and not only that but you know IBM was a big was a big maker of Punch Cards and so initially IBM said well we don't need a computer we have this profitable business in Punch Cards and so when the government doesn't invest enough um you tend to end up with a society that doesn't have enough basic R&amp;D it doesn't tend to have enough Transportation infrastructure and really crucially it doesn't tend to have enough of an educated population so if you're over 65 in the United States you're part of the most educated generation in the world there are there is no other country where people over AG 65 are more educated than Americans are if you're younger you are not part of the most educated generation in the world and so to me a whole set of policies where we decide we're going to spend money today to make life better tomorrow um is another really important part of creating an economy that um is more prosperous for most people than our current economy is we'll be right back talk to us about your what are your views on immigration and I'd be curious if you could tie it back it strikes me that it's going to probably be either the number one of the number two issue in the campaign but give us your view of the atmospherics around immigration and what the right and the left are getting wrong and what you think uh how you think it's going to play out in the election the the chapter of my book on immigration is the one that I was most uncertain um and if I'm being honest nervous about what the response would be and I actually think it's been the one where the feedback I've gotten has been the best um which makes me feel really happy because I it also might be the chapter that I learned the most while researching and writing there's probably a relationship between those two things and so I spent a ton of time uh in the archives um retracing the history of the 1965 law that has really created our modern immigration system and that law has a really one really heroic piece of its Legacy and one much less heroic piece of its Legacy the heroic piece of its Legacy was that starting in the 1920s our country basically said um we will only take immigrants from Western Europe the one other exception was at the time there were no limits on immigration from Latin America which may seem uh shocking today but at the time there just weren't that many people coming from Latin America so um uh we our country basically said we won't take people from Eastern Europe we won't take them from southern Europe we won't take them from Africa we won't take them from Asia obviously a racist policy right it was just taking them from from White countries and the 1965 law got rid of that old system and they said we will treat all people who want to immigrate to our country equally at the same time the advocates for that 1965 law promised repeatedly we're talking about LBJ Ted Kennedy who managed the bill in the Senate Republicans and Democrats who pushed the law repeatedly they promised we are only changing who can come in we are not changing how many people come in they promised Americans again and again and again we are not meaningfully increasing the level of immigration if they hadn't done that the bill couldn't have passed Americans did not favor a huge increase in Immigration and yet for technical reasons that I won't bore your listeners with the bill did in fact lead almost immediately to an enormous increase in Immigration mostly involving exceptions with family members who didn't count toward the cap but basically what happened in the 1960s was we vastly opened our our immigration system and Congress and the president sold it to the the American people under false pretenses and I'm not saying that all of our immigration policy and all of the toxicity of the debate around it stems from that that one decision but for people who tend to be in favor of much higher levels of immigration a very high levels of immigration which I would say are basically two groups of Americans kind of business-friendly Republicans who see it as a way to increase the workforce and probably hold down wages and then progressives who believe in high levels of immigration from sort of a social justice standpoint for people who believe in higher levels of immigration it's worth grappling with the fact that the history of this um is not a simple history in which the people who were in favor of more immigration were on the side of light and truth and the people who were worried about it um were not and I think that we have lost this tradition that we had for a very long time in our country in which there were progressives who worried about the effects that immigration would have on recent immigrants and on Lower inome native born Americans historically civil rights leaders and labor leaders and progressives were not in favor of huge levels of immigration in this country and we've sort of lost that and to me it's really an important part of why so many working-class people across races look at the Democratic party today and say oof I'm not completely comfortable with that party and on the flip side the Republican party just engages in this really really Stark and and nasty xenophobia on immigration and we've sort of missed this Middle Ground where we have people saying look we should welcome immigrants we are a nation of immigrants but we also need borders and we need border security and everybody who wants to come to this country because it's a richer country than most countries can't simply come because they want to and I think that kind of summarizes where We've Ended up on immigration and frankly why it's been becomes such a huge problem for Joe Biden H and what it strikes me as such a political Hot Potato when you think about an approach to immigration um who would you point to or what policy would you point to that you think is as a way forward a figure who I talk a lot about in the book is Barbara Jordan the former congresswoman um late congresswoman from Texas um one of the first postreconstruction black Americans to represent the south in Congress she became famous during Watergate and she if you read some of her historical positions on this she said look we need to be pro-immigrant but that doesn't always mean being pro-immigration we need to reject the xenophobia and racism that often greets immigrants but that doesn't mean that we should have an open border I think that is the is the position that first of all tends to reflect what most Americans believe and also has very strong economic arguments behind it and today I think where you tend to see that a lot is you tend to see it from Democrats who are Mayors and governors and who've actually had to Grapple with some of the really costly and chaotic influxes that we've had over the last couple years but also reject um some of the the race baiting that that many Republicans use so David you're obviously have your finger on the I just want to as we wrap up here I'm just very curious to get your view on the role that age and uh this presidential race is going to play I mean one of the hardest questions right now right here's one way that I think about the overall frame age is absolutely a legitimate issue to talk about and it's important to talk about it with both candidates it's also important to acknowledge that there are several ways in which which Donald Trump seems more energetic and presents as less old than Biden there are other ways in which you know Trump says a whole bunch of things that don't make any sense and and forgets things there are other ways in which Trump say aging seems to be at least as much of a problem as Biden does at the same time as a journalist I'm a little bit haunted by a Gallup poll that came out after the 2016 campaign that asked Americans what they'd heard about each C and the number one thing that most Americans reported hearing about Hillary Clinton was about her emails I think Hillary Clinton's emails were a legitimate story surely they were not the most important thing about Hillary Clinton in 2016 and I worry a little bit that those of us in the media are at some risk of repeating that and talking so much about Joe Biden's age in particular that we come to make it seem like the only issue in this election Joe Biden's performance as president suggests he absolutely can do this job and so we're not dealing with someone who appears to be incompetent as president whether you agree or disagree with his policies just look how much legislation he's gotten passed more than I expected quite frankly much of it bipartisan I don't have a nce like kind of nice Pat answer here Scott but I'm just trying to get at the fact that on the one hand it's a legitimate issue and on the other hand I think sometimes the media those of us in the media have a tendency to take a legitimate issue and make it seem like the only issue and I think we'd be making a big mistake if we did that with Joe Biden's age David Leonard is a senior writer of the New York Times where he writes the morning the times Flagship daily newsletter he's also been the newspaper's Washington bureau chief and oped columnist a staff writer for the New York Times magazine and the founding editor of the upshot he you want a pullit surprise for commentary in 2011 David's also the author of ours was The Shining future the story of the American dream which the Atlantic and the financial times called one of the best books of 2023 he joins us from his home in our nation's capital uh David really appreciate your time Scott thank you so much for this good [Music] conversation [Music]
