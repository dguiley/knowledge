you pay everyone on your team $210,000 a year and they get to work between 1 and 5 days a week and they get to choose if they take their pay in cash or Equity one of the factors that you can control when it comes to building a great company and something of value is getting the right people on the bus and we have a model that helps us get the right people on the bus once we recognized that staying small was the most important thing to us we said how does a small company of 20 people compete with a big company of 200 people and and the first sort of realization was you're going to have to hire great people Jeff Roberts CEO of outa Welcome to SAS Academy podcast man it's good to have you good to be here thanks for having me Matt love it so we do a lot of research before the shows and there was a couple of cool things that stood out but where I would love to start is I feel like people aspire to take small companies and make them big right everyone talks about growth we talk about growth all of our customers want to grow when they come and join SAS Academy um and I wouldn't say that I feel like you don't want to grow obviously you're running a super successful company but I think one of the things that fascinates me is you went from a really large company that you grew right uh at buildium and then left to co-found a company or to found a company excuse me that you're intentionally building to stay small from a headcount standpoint um and so I would love to know you know in your buildium days like what what was that Journey like because you started pretty early and were with up through 20 million in Revenue right yeah I I so I started my career uh at another SAS business called called buildium um was super fortunate I had no particular interest in technology no particular interest in startups um it was just the first job that I got out of school and without uh without knowing it I stumbled into a really good situation company had found product Market fit um it was basically all Engineers when I showed up and they said hey we need someone to figure out how to take this product to Market and figure out the marketing piece go sit over there and do some marketing um and I tell people all the time um my entire career has benefited from that experience I just walked into a team of people that knew how to build a SAS business and um in most ways did sort of everything right um we bootstrapped the business to about $7 million in Revenue we recognized at that point the growth of the business was hindered only by not having more cash to invest in the business so we raised funding um you know had a big acquisition sold to a public company all those sorts of things um and had a great experience so a lot of people see what we're doing at outset of today and say this has to be a reaction to something that went wrong and the evils of venture capital and all that kind of stuff um couldn't be further from the truth uh but we did say hey we've got an opportunity to start with a blank slate what do we want to do differently and one of the things that really drove every other decision as we said when we were a company of 20 employees it was just more fun than when we were a company of 200 there's you know less bureaucracy less politics less all of those things so we said if we don't want to run a 200 person company how can we still build a successful business what does that need to look like um how do we sort of work within the confines of um let's just say for the sake of example never growing Beyond people and that that colors everything that we do at outset of today that's awesome what was uh what was one of the things that you learned um what was one of the things that you learned to do at buildium when it was big that you like you learned how to do it I think people talk about this like they navigate big businesses they figure out how to get stuff done it's like this whole skill set what was one of those things that you you learned how to do it and got good at it but you realized you didn't want to do that in your next company yeah it's a good it's a good question um and in in some ways I don't have a good answer to this to be honest to you with you um I think personally one of my best skills is people management and I basically don't manage people anymore um so like that was something towards the end of my time at buildium I was the head of marketing and the marketing team was 15 or 16 people so a lot of my day-to-day um was facilitated meetings it was doing you know one-on ones and standups and providing feedback and all those kinds of things um and the ultimate irony at now is sure those are good skills and yes um you know some of that leadership and sort of General managerial experience has been ported over to outa uh but I operate much more like an individual contributor today um than I did most of my time at buildium that's awesome and I don't want to touch on it here in a little bit when we talk about how how outset of runs but you know once you went through so you were at build all the way through the acquisition uh I left a couple years prior a couple years prior cool and did you leave to start the company was that like why you left or no I didn't um I so I was at buildium for for five years uh the the company went basically startup to $20 million in Revenue at that point um and my reason for leaving was kind of twofold one is I got a a really great job opportunity that was a a VP opportunity and a big raise in in compensation and and those sorts of things but even more than that I felt like I needed to diversify my experience um buildium was my first job out of college it was sort of all that I had all that I had known all that I had done professionally and I felt like I needed to prove to myself that I could operate in a different environment and diversify my experience a bit um honestly I have mixed feelings about it in in retrospect I think my reasoning was very sound but I don't know that I appreciate it as a young person how truly special of a place buildium was and I think that's something I I've seen with other people that have started their careers in in great companies they don't fully recognize how rare it is to be part of a company that's growing that rapidly that's having that level of success um so it's kind of a wash should I have should I have stayed maybe I should have stayed um but we're here today and uh one of build's co-founders is my co-founder at outs seta so it all it all worked out pretty well what was the like what was the the moment where you birthed the idea and actually before you answer that so the first time I ever interacted with you was on Twitter um because I um I pulled up the tweet I got to find it but I basically was was waxing online about how I hated all the crms that were out there I've never seen your product before and I was just like man it's all super sales and marketing focused a bad job on the Cs handoffs ites it's all like you know top down from a funnel standpoint it's not you know customer data is not the anchor and I I had like seven or eight tweets on this thing and you literally replied and you said this is out seta period And I was like oh that's pretty cool and I started checking out checking out what you would built so I'd love to hear from your standpoint like did you have a similar frustration with what was out there or like how did you how did you start the company uh a massive frustration I would I would say and it still boggles my mind that more people particularly within the SAS space don't recognize what I'm about to tell you or or talk about what I'm about to tell you more so we did what every fast growing early stage SAS company does um and I was sort of the business user my now co-founder Dimitri was the CTO I went to Dimitri and I was like we need to integrate stripe and charge beef for for billing and then oh we need HubSpot for marketing Automation and it's time to get Salesforce for a CRM and we need zenes for support and we need chart Mogul for reporting and next thing you know we were spending a lot of time and energy integrating all these tools to the extent that Demitri kind of threw his hands up one day and was like listen Jeff I'm spending a huge percentage of my time integrating software when I should be building our software uh and what was born was really a very very basic TCH stack that Dimitri actually built to support company in its early years and we used that Tech stack um to scale to about $7 million a year in Revenue before we um kicked it to the curb and sort of piece meal together a more formidable t uh Tech stack but when we kind of looked back we said you know what every SAS business out there needs the same core tools like everybody needs payments everybody needs authentication everybody needs a CRM everybody needs email and help desk why is everybody like peac mealing all this together when the core needs are the same sure there's lots of other tools you can fold in um but but that's where the business idea came from and a parallel that people really like is if you're launching an e-commerce store there's Shopify Shopify makes it easy it kind of gives you the basics um and that's very very much what we're trying to do at outsa um for other SAS businesses so what was the like what was the atomic unit so to speak of the of the business though right because if you were integrating all that other stuff were you building a different business this was an internal tool that you spun out to become the main business or like what was the first idea so we we built our own internal tooling we were like um you know rather than buying zenes I think the first bit that was actually built was support ticketing we were like we don't need all the features of zenes it's expensive we need like basic ticketing andri built something and then we we sort of did the same thing with CRM we did the same thing with um other other areas of the business and um we started to be Fair we started from scratch when we started out seta we didn't take the infrastructure that we had built for buildium and sort of productize that um but it was heavily heavily heavily informed by sort of these simple tools that we had built internally got it that was the context I was missing so you went through this at buildium and this is where you started rolling your own Tech stack and then you said this could be a product and and went out to go build it exactly got it that's cool it's cool and so it was you and Demitri to start and right so what you you want to stay under 20 what's your head now we're six now six people like on our team now and then we've got two or three contractors that kind of come in as needed that's cool and and of course the your kind of your claim to fame at least in my world I'd love to nerd out on teams and comp and structures and the whole nine yards is um you pay everyone on your team $210,000 a year and they get to work between one and five days a week and you PR rate that salary based on how many days a week and they get to choose if they take their pay in cash or Equity did I capture it all got it those are those are sort of the three the three pillars so um where it all comes from it all ties directly back to that goal of staying small so once we recognized that staying small was was sort of the most important thing to us or at least where we wanted to start we said how does a small company of 20 people compete with a big company of 200 people and the first sort of realization was you're going to have to hire great people you're going to have to hire sort of these 10x employees um how do you go about doing that we said you got have to pay them pretty well um $210,000 I recognize you know if you're an engineer at a Facebook or whatever you can make a lot more money than that but we think that's a pretty healthy pay rate that's going to attract generally good people um so we started there then we said you know what we're bootstrapping this huge product it's going to take us a long time to generate uh significant Revenue how do we attract these people to the team early on uh and we said let's give them an opportunity from an equity perspective that is way accelerated compared to what you'd see in a typical tech company so if you come in you can decide how much or how little you want to work for equity and you start earning that Equity immediately um so everybody on our team is a a meaningful owner in the business um and then we said okay what else can we do to help us sort of attract this sort of top talent if you will we said a lot of great people particularly in the context of startups have their own projects um or might not be looking for a full-time opportunity uh let's give them the ability if we can get an amazing person two days a week I'll take that amazing person two days a week I don't need them five days a week um so these things kind of all coales together and a lot of people particularly in the startup world who look at this model kind of scoff at me and they're like oh you've you know you've been around long enough now you have the capital to be bble to pay these people these great salaries like this isn't helpful to us in the context of being an early stage company and they're completely missing the point the the beauty of the model is not that you need to be able to pay everybody $210,000 a year right out of the gates it's that you can step into it so as we make more money we basically sit down with a team every quarter and we say you know we've grown Revenue by x%c we can afford to step up people's involvement in the business and their cash compens compensation um accordingly and people generally ramp up in the company um in terms of their their pay as we're able to pay them more so it's been a really powerful way to communicate to our entire team this is what growth looks like you have a huge impact on growth and as the business grows this is sort of how everybody's going to scale up within the context of the company that's interesting and so as you grow like does the 210 number go up or is it the ratio between equity and cash that like you guys slide that around so we we call it um we we call it like a build your own adventure compensation model um and it looks very different for everybody on our team to to be frank so I'll I'll give you a few examples uh myself right now uh I work on the business five days a week I am getting paid three and a half days a week and earning equity in the company one and a half days a week um so my full-time salary right now if you do the math it's 147 ,500 a year we've had other employees um Bernard is an engineer on our team for example when he was looking for his next job um due to he was the CTO at buildium also so he's someone we knew but um due to buildium success he had some Financial Security he didn't need to optimize for cash right out of the gate uh he came to us and said you know what I want to build equity on this thing fast I I believe in it I'm going to work mostly for equity and in two years two and a half years he built up like a 14 or 15% ownership stake in the company which is incredibly fast uh to own that much of a a business um but then we have a lot of other not a lot of other because we're a small team but other employees who um totally just want to get to that $210,000 number as fast as possible and they don't care so much about the equity they want the cash so we have very open conversations about all of this we factor in things like how long you been with the business um how important your your sort of role or position um is in the company at that moment your personal circumstances and uh so far it's it's always gone totally well in terms of having these conversations with our team and making adjustments accordingly that's interesting and so you just have to kind of manage the tension in the system essentially like if you have someone who says I want to work four days a week for cash you might say I can only give you two days a week for cash but if you want to work for you can get to an equity what do you want to do is it like that's that's exactly right yep and so one of the prerequisites to make this all work is you have to be completely transparent with everything within the business so all of our employees like down to the penny in our bank account like they know everything and they know um sort of as we grow how how things are going to shift and who's up next for a bump in their pay and all that kind of stuff that's interesting how um I'm so fascinated by this I hope you don't mind all the uh all the question on this but I think people listening to this it's so it's such a it's such a 180 degree pivot from all of the like natural well accepted company building wisdom and how you structure things I mean so no no equity no Cliffs no nothing like that it's just basically you get it when you earn it and and that's that's the game you get it when you earn it there are um there are some important nuances I would say so the way that our Equity Pool Works is it grows over time as people elect to work days for Equity so let's say across all of our employees all time a 100 days have been worked for equity and I've worked 10 of them I own 10% of the business but as people continue to work for Equity that 100 number grows so what that means is if somebody left the company or just stopped working for Equity altogether their Equity stake would diminish gradually over time so that's a little bit of a protective measure for us right it's it's a protective measure every every way and certainly our goal isn't to have people working for free and for Equity Forever at some point will will probably freeze the equity pool where it is or do something different with it um but it diminishes at this point we're an eight-year-old business it diminishes very very slowly um so that is kind of an important protection I would say but aside from that um the way that I look at it is to your point the conventional wisdom for whatever reason uh seems to be like I am the founder I'm going to hold on to every scrap of equity that I possibly can hire other people you know give them as little Equity as possible and when there's an exit like the value of the equity I'm I'm the one realizing the benefit uh and that that's totally okay there's nothing wrong with that like something I try to communicate to people is our way is not right and that way is wrong it's all personal preference and what bets you're willing to make sure for me personally um I would even go so far as to say that I think I will make less money if there is a an ex event of some sort using the scenario that we're using but I think that our odds of success go up um in my opinion one of the factors that you can control when it comes to building a great company and something of value is getting the right people on the bus and we have a model that helps us get the right people on the bus so um I'm sort of maybe betting on a lesser end outcome but a higher probability of making that outcome occur at least in in my opinion what's interesting if you if you kind of reverse it and and kind of work backwards from the end you'll probably still experience less solution than a successfully exited Venture backf founder at the end of the day you own more of the company than they do in a lot of cases we we have fought tooth and nail uh to remain bootstrapped for exactly that reason so yeah yeah yeah yeah it would be tough to stack the two right take like Venture Capital type delution after running this model um it's interesting so I get very like calm company Vibes I think about base camp and Jason I think about Tyler from from the calm fund yeah um you know like Jason and dhh did a lot of writing a couple of years back on why they didn't issue Equity to their teammates at base camp because they weren't planning on exiting they wanted to run it forever and then I think they did um how does this will be relative to your goals for the company like how does the equity benefit the employees like is it you know what what do they get from it so there's two things um first of all yes they get these aggressive Equity grants um but if we're not like out for an acquisition anytime soon is it worth anything second piece is there is a profit sharing component too um the reality is we haven't done profit sharing yet because we're reinvesting profits and the growth of the business still um but there is this alternative path whereby if the company is doing really well we can share profits with with people to help them earn above that salary um based on the company's performance um but the way that I would think about the value of the equity is is this um we are very much not out for an exit event anytime soon we said when we started the company and a lot of people say this but I think at this point we have evidence that we've like we said it seriously and and planned to execute it um we said we're going to do this for at least 15 years uh and we even picked the idea for the business because we said what's still going to be relevant 15 years from now we we thought SAS would be and we knew that payments and CRM and email and help desk tools sort of weren't going anywhere they might evolve but there would be a need for those categories of software so from the get-go the mindset was we know what we need to build we know it's a big product we know it's going to take a long time particularly because we're bootstrapping we just need to give ourselves a long period of time in which to execute and if we do this for 15 years and look up we're going to have lots of good options so we're about halfway through that uh 15year period right now that is still very much the mindset we're you know not looking to sell we're not looking to do anything we're looking to execute for seven and a half more years and I'm pretty confident if we do that when I look up um whether it's selling the business or um you know bringing in new leaders ship or whatever it might be we'll we'll have some good options and that Equity will become meaningful for our employees I want to understand your mindset a little bit more around this you know there's it's one of these things and I'm sure you you probably you know you're a great writer so you know I'm assuming you're a reader because most writers are voracious readers and you can see when people have things that work and then they do writing about them a lot of the time it's easy to put the put the rose-colored glasses on and be like I always knew that would work right like yeah man I I'm nervous just hearing you explain how your company Works what would what made you nervous in the early days like what what was your biggest fear about giving this much Equity out and doing this unconventional model yeah to be to be honest with you um the equity part never really bothered me and still doesn't um I think what the equity part does is it forces you to hire slowly and intentionally and I think that's a good practice anyways um so believe believe it or not that that part never scared me the second blog post I ever wrote um going back seven years now is called uh my reservations with our startup idea and how I overcame them or something like that um and everything I wrote in that post was right to be honest with you um the the reservations that I had in short were the market that we were out to Target um meaning early stage SAS businesses and pretty much every challenge in our company boils down to we sell to early stage SAS businesses um and it's just a matter of yes it's a relatively small Market it's not as big as people think it is um but more so these companies fail at an alarming rate so yeah we have relatively High churn um if you look at just traditional SAS metrics on one hand the product is insanely sticky if somebody if any company goes on and has any measure of success and I mean makes $500 in Mr the churn rate is close to zero but we have high churn just because so many of these businesses go go out of business so that's what keeps me up at night um that has always been the biggest hindrance to our growth we need to figure out how to acquire customers extremely cost effectively to accommodate for that for that churn um and it's something where always talking about internally including right now um we don't want to go up Market we purposely in the lower end of the market but how can we find more stable customer segments within this end of the market you know the SAS businesses doing 500k to5 million a year how can we sort of dominate that space and find those companies um that's that's the challenge in our business yeah that's interesting because I would imagine that there's I don't know diminishing returns might be the wrong word but there it's definitely some challenges trying to put more um more advanced businesses into a platform like yours right from an activation standpoint a data migration standpoint I'm sure it's a it's a big bite you know yeah people we say all the time um like if if you're a venture capitalist looking at outa you are puking like it it is not it is not something you doing everything backwards what you doing it's everything you don't want it's like a high turn customer segment our most successful customers outgrow us all these sorts of things now of course we want to mature the product and make it so larger customers can stay with us but the goal is not to go up Market um in short the way that I articulate it today is we want to take companies from zero to 10 million if you a year in Revenue if you get to $10 million a year in Revenue you are going to be hiring VPS they are going to have specialized tools that they have experience with that they want to use and there's kind of a natural break point that that's not like a perfect metric but that is the life cycle that we are trying to support and we've already proven out that there's enough lifetime value um in that range to build a viable business on it yeah that's cool so all right so no issues on the equity we got a whole bunch of owners aside from you and Dimitri yep um you know people who talk about managing teams they throw this phrase around a lot right I want you to act like an owner I want you to act like an owner right what's what's an example that you've seen in your team where somebody really embodied it not you or your co-founder like what comes to mind it this is the simplest concept that like in this whole conversation people are like how do you get people to act like owners you give them ownership it's it's really really simple um there is almost no like management that goes on at outa um there's nothing like like no one tells anyone what to do we hire people that are fired up about this model who we think are super talented and we basically say Where can you contribute to the company go do your thing you know what our goals are you know that we want to grow this of course we have like a road map and an idea of what's important in any given time but people self- police like if they help the company grow they own a meaningful part of the company and it benefits them if they don't they're only hurting themselves um and I think just by focusing on hiring great people who this model resonates with and giving them actual ownership it's sort of a self- police thing H that's awesome do the uh I guess I can't really call any of them employees all owners most likely right but do do what kind of say does your team have when you bring somebody new in is that like a a decision does it look like a panel interview and you got like a mallet you can be someone like what's going on you know how does it work yeah I I would say first of all all of this is relatively easy because we're still small right we a question we get all the time is like does this model scale and um the answer is it doesn't need to scale because we don't want to be that big we only people asking that question probably missing the point right exactly so it yeah I I don't think scalability is a huge problem um when we hire somebody it's kind of a big like it's a big deal internally we have identified some need in the business where we've said we we have a gap and we need to fill it um and yes like they will talk to everybody on our team being the the size that we are typically we do start with some sort of contract based project so we get to feel each other out um and and all those sorts of things um but it's it's similar to any other hiring process really um there's no like one person in charge with making the hiring decisions I think we generally as a company um will lean on people who have subject expertise in that given area so my background is in marketing if we're hiring another marketing to the team I probably have the most say and sort of the end say and I would have less if we hiring a developer than the other developers do got it that's interesting and so and not a lot of management so like what I I love to ask leaders this question I think your your answer is going to be different than most like what are the rhythms that that you use to run the business how do you do it yeah um so like another part of the reason we operate this way is this idea of life profitability that we can get into but um like my overarching mindset is yes the goal of Entrepreneurship is to make money of course um but it is also to enrich the lives of myself and the people on our team and let them do the sorts of things that they want to do with their lives um and I believe that a workplace like outsa can have an enormous impact on someone's life by by giving them that space so we do very very very asynchronous work um we have a single meeting a week it's on Mondays like in the the early afternoon where we get together and um you know we talk about the things happening in the business and what we're all up to and all of that but it's a 45 minute meeting outside of that um you know it's it's basically slack and yes we do like a lot of um looms and stuff like that to to communicate with one another but it's very asynchronous work and I think the other thing that is um conducive to this model in our case is there's a lot less um a lot fewer questions around like what our strategy needs to be and what we need to build because we're not building something new and novel that sort of needs to be validated and there's all these question marks everywhere we're building categories of software that everyone has seen a thousand times um and like our product strategy at this point is all the core features of the product are there we want to make them competitive with the best products in each of the software categories we compete with so is outsa as good of an email tool as convertkit no we want to you know close that Gap and it makes it much easier from a strategic perspective and from a roadmap perspective like I kind of know today what we're going to be building for years into the future it's just a matter of our ability to to execute it well that's interesting and I guess with with the lack of synchronous meetings that removes any complexity from people working varying numbers of days of the week or any of that kind of stuff and it's uh it's pretty self-fulfilling then yeah yeah I mean there's always a question a very valid question we get a lot um comes from sort of the fractional the fractional work Arrangement and um how do you police sort of somebody working two days a week um I I think it does go back to the equity piece it's like yeah um you know it is self- policing in that regard but we don't like we're not tracking anybody's hours we have some employees that work two days a week and it's like they work Monday and Wednesday we have others that will work two days a week and they work like two hours on the business every day um it it's very it's very loose is the only only thing I can communicate there yeah that's cool and so I can tell you with a pretty high degree of confidence Jee that most of the founders listening to this podcast are not running a business that operates anywhere anything remotely similar to the way yours does sure but um the interesting thing is I bet there's a subset of those people that wish it did yeah right and so my question is if what would you say to a Founder who wants to make their company calmer or make their company more asynchronous or just kind of implement some of the things that you've done like how would you coach that person yeah there there's a few things that come to mind um the the first one is I just like this idea that there's so much innovation in what all these tech companies are building but so little little innovation in how we build these companies and I think that's a missed opportunity and I think a lot of people I talk to get very hung up in legal structures and things like that and see these as obstacles but at the end of the day you can run your business however you want like you really have way more freedom than you you probably think that you do um so I'd encourage people to start there and just say like best case scenario how does this look and feel to you yeah um beyond that uh I think it comes down to figuring out what what your what your goals are and and also I think there are some criteria that really need to be things that you believe in for this to all work like you you you have to be comfortable sharing all of your company information you you have to um believe that people have given Equity will act like owners uh you you have to believe that you can build a high trust environment and you know hiring slowly is is part of that if if you find yourself nodding to these ideas um then I think you can implement this successfully and the other the other thing again is like I think the structure is great for startups I think you can step into to it and it it provides a road map for how you're going to grow and all those things that I mentioned um so so those are the things I would say to people and a lot of people have looked at the model in general and said oh this is so idealistic um and and my response is always yes and and shouldn't it be like if you're going to start a company if you're going to devote 40 50 whatever hours of your life each week to doing something shouldn't it be idealistic um yeah so I I like to kind of turn the thought process on its head a little bit um it's definitely not a good model if you're a control freak but if if you uh believe in some of the things that I I said I think it's a totally viable path yeah so you mentioned uh you mentioned this concept of life profitability is that related to like adp's book he wrote that life profitability um he and I talked about a little bit um on the Pod is that where that comes from it is yes um he is actually co-hosting a podcast with me that we just started on on this topic um oh my favorite people just coming together in this little world it's good we were just hanging out in uh in Denver a couple weeks ago we flew up for our event and uh did an episode together ad's great yeah he's he's awesome and uh I I read his book um a couple years ago and it just it just gave language to a lot of the things that I had been thinking about myself and a lot of the ideas that outsa was really based around um and I said there there's the terminology let let's use that and uh next thing you know some actually Arvid call connected us and we're oh cool working on a podcast um focused on other entrepreneurs who are sort of building companies in this way yeah that's amazing that's super cool yeah he had a he had a lot of great stuff to share because I mean he you know I mean his Journey's been been incredible through woo Commerce and then two other companies after that and some big some small some co-founders some not he uh he shared some cool stuff on the uh on the Pod talk talk about a roller coaster of experience he's uh he's had all the highs and lows could imagine so man I know that's right he sure has that's cool um all right awesome well let's switch gears for a minute then because you know you've done a lot of writing I'm sure a lot of thinking and and experimentation on pricing pricing in general pricing for uh for your product in particular U but I'm curious like maybe instead of the usual question which would be you know tell me how you approach pricing I would love to know have you what was a pricing model you tried that didn't work yeah um it's a good question our so our pricing model has not changed much uh we we have changed aspects of it but the overarching model has not changed um really in any fundamental way and the reason for that in short is pricing out seta is incredibly difficult um and I'll explain why you you might not think this at first um but if you just look at the category of software that we cover a lot of payment tools um use sort of a a usage based uh a monetization model where they take a percentage of Revenue processed through your platform stripe for example takes their 2.9% we do we do that so I'll get to what we do but yes we do that on the billing side um if you look at CRM tools or help desk tools those are usually um per user per seat pricing models if you look at email tools of often times it's it's like the number of subscribers or the number of emails sent um and we have kind of all these components and one of our Initial Ideas was let's just charge a a flat subscription fee and you sort of get everything and that sounds like a good idea and I wish that we did that in many ways but if you just charge it let's call it $99 a month if you just charge $99 a month you're suddenly going to attract a whole group of people that realize they can send unlimited emails for which we have costs that are going to sign up for the platform and send thousands and thousands and thousands of emails so everything we we sort of um started looking at became problematic in one way or the other because we're not just building one one of these categories of software we need a model that accommodates all of them yeah um so the the overarching strategy that we landed on and that we use today is there is a monthly subscription fee it starts at 39 bucks a month um and that gives you access to everything you get the the CRM the email the help desk the authentication the reporting the entire platform is 39 bucks a month and what we're trying to do there is basically give the product away for a very artificially inexpensive price um if you look at the price of outsa versus you know buying an email tool and a help desk tool and a CRM and Etc it's very very very cheap and that's by Design because we sell the startup so it's like here's a almost non-negotiable like amazing deal if you want to start with us and then as you grow uh we take a 1% fee on successfully processed payments so the idea is as the startup grows so does our cut of Revenue and we're sort of like a 1% investor in all of our customers um that that model is has worked pretty pretty well for us uh to be honest we we did have um um a fremium plan originally which was one of the bigger mistakes um so I guess we now that I'm saying this and backpedaling a little bit um we we we did uh we did sort of goof with a fremium model the actual paid plans always operated the same way but in our early years um we had a free tier so you could sort of try everything for as long as you wanted and you'd eventually trip over sort of a usage threshold and move on to our paid plans um the big learning there and I I talked about this one a lot is premium is tough for small bootstrap teams I think um and for us it was particularly tough from a support perspective um we just had at one point it was thousands of uh free users signing up every month and they were hitting our support queue asking questions about integrating outsa with all sorts of different Frameworks and Technologies and and whatnot um and it just got to the point where it ground our ability to focus on marketing or building new products to a halt um so we killed we killed fremium which also um it's not the easiest thing to do once you have a fremium plan you're even if you kill it you're going to have people that um were on that plan well into the future um so we moved to a a free trial model um where we require credit card up front you're sort of on a fastpack to fast uh track to conversion and uh we sort of deliberately shrunk our our world um and it it's worked much better for us so when you turned premium off did you stop letting people who were on it continue to use it or did you stop selling it we we've we let everybody that was on it continue on it um and that's uh that's something that to date we have taken a lot of a lot of pride in and sort of one of the reasons we want to stay small and independent in general um we have raised prices we've never raised prices or changed prices in any way for any of our existing customers um I would like to see if we can actually keep that forever like whatever price you signed up at you you can stay on that forever I don't know that that's going to be the case or not um but yeah we still have freemi users today that's interesting we spent a lot of energy in the academy trying to coach bootstrap Founders out of doing premium yeah it's it is for the exact reason you laid out there's just there are so many hidden costs sounds so good on the surface and then when it gets into actually holding the quality bar of the kind of interactions you want to have as a Founder takes pride in what what they do it's tough man some uh a founder of a like AI startup that's being born out of a Lab at Harvard uh reached out to me yesterday and he was like I read your article on Premium versus free trial what should I do and my response in short is always the same it's like if your primary objective is product feedback go ahead have a Premium plan get people into the platform um that like that that's fine if you're looking for exposure and feedback premium works very well if you're trying to validate whether or not you have a business you need to start collecting payments as soon as possible and not offer premium so yeah yeah yeah no doubt business not an art project you got to pick which one it's gonna be exactly how do you um how do you maintain this balance though because you know you do a lot of things that are are really solid for your customers um but at the same time I mean everything's getting more expensive your cost are going up I'm sure um like how do you how do you balance this to keep the business healthy yeah it's a good it's a good question um outa doesn't operate with huge margins first of all so we'll just throw that throw that out there um I would say that uh this will be an unpopular answer with a lot of people for many valid reasons um but we have built some advantages into our business now simply because we were willing to suffer longer than others um so like because we have just built this company over over eight years and we haven't taken external financing and we've made a lot of other um I can give you some examples but we've made some product decisions where we elected to do things a much harder way than our customers did because they would give us the ability to pass lower um prices on to our customers we just suffered from for a long long long time to be honest with you and um now we have some real advantages around pricing because of that um I don't know that I would encourage other people to suffer for as long as we did but it it's certainly something that benefits us now um I do also think that yes we've been extremely customer friendly with our pricing and not raising pricing and um all those sorts of things I'm sure we will at some point um and uh you know we'll sort of sharpen our sword when it comes to revenue optimization more so than we have done so today um I just want to be very very confident when we make whatever pricing change that is that we can look back and say look we haven't raised prices in eight years we've delivered these 150 features or optimizations like yeah we we have worked for this and I I already know um that when we get there our our customers will will understand it's cool um yeah I'm sure they will I mean especially with how transparent you guys are you know just outward outwardly to the market and to your customers let's talk about suffering man so yeah you know I have this strongly held belief that every successful business is the Survivor of a near-death experience and I'm sure you probably have a few buried in your in your resume like so when you say suffer for an abnormally long period of time like what was going on how long did were you suffering for like what was the what the lows of this whole story yeah uh we we have some good ones so that one of the really interesting things about our business I think um at least for other co-founders listening to this or or founders of businesses our we have three co-founders and we all have very different Financial positions um one of us is completely set for life one of us is kind of in the middle and I'm I'm the poor one um but that that right away introduces a pretty interesting Dynamic right it's like we're we obviously all want this thing to be successful but our experiences and what our entrepreneurial Journey has looked and felt like are are quite different frankly yeah um and again it just takes like philosophical alignment and being open and those sorts of things to to work through all of that but long story short um outet it took two years to get to Market it's this huge product so it took about two years to even build the MVP year three we focused entirely on selling to developers and I would say we struggled mightily what we sort of realized was we were trying to change the default behavior of developers developers love to over architect their Tech stack in their early days they have the skill set to do so you can even get them to make an intellectual argument that it's not the best use of their time but most of them are going to do so anyways yeah so uh about three three to even four years in into outet up uh we had very very little Revenue um I forget exactly what it was at four years in but it was small it was like five or $6 thousand a month in Mr maybe um after three or four years of effort which is a long time to put in to get to five or or $6,000 in Mr anyways uh around that time um I was still Consulting to to pay my bills outset I was not might have been paying me $1,000 a month something like that something very inconsequential um let's put it that way uh I found out un unexpectedly in regards to one of them uh that my wife and I were having twin boys uh we knew that we were getting pregnant we didn't know that there were two coming uh and then six months later a pandemic hit and my wife lost her job and I lost my Consulting work so I was sitting there at that point with a SAS product I'd put about four years of effort into that wasn't paying me anything my wife had no income we had two little kids at home and you better believe uh we had a moment of Reckoning and uh you know serious conversations about is there reason to believe in this thing and continue working on it or not sure um so yeah that was enormously financially stressful um I decided to continue on I wish I had some great answer for you uh I I don't really it was more stubbornness than anything um yeah I would say that I kind of looked at the idea of walking away from something I'd put four years of effort into with nothing and I couldn't stomach that um that that's one piece the other piece is I knew I had my co-founders right like even though I I never and I still don't even think outsa is like this great business idea um I knew that I had the right people on on the team and I said you know what if if I didn't do this I'd want to work on a startup again I'd want to work with these guys we've got a pretty you know we've got a four-year head start on a product that I think there is a market for that is not going to go away we just need to continue working on this thing and uh long story short in in year four we sort of got discovered by the no code Community um and what we found there was a Target buyer that doesn't have the skill set to integrate all these tools um that outset is arguably that much more valuable to and that really kicked us um into gear and we started growing and um you know then we had more reason to believe because Revenue was actually growing in a substantial way and then ironically enough the developers kind of came running back um with the developers it was really a matter of seeing the product mature they're much more knowledgeable buyers they you know know the ins and outs of the payment tools and authentication tools and email tools and the way that the less technical buyers don't but as the product got better um you know we were able to serve both those audiences that much better and ultimately uh the business started to work um but it was it was there's such a good lesson in there though hold on if I can jump in for a sec I just want to like I try to do this I just like pause to shine a light on something you said because you know there's there's a lot of early stage Founders who listen to this podcast man and and it it's like the the one feature away fallacy right where you always think I I'm trying to sell in your case these developers if I just change the authentication thing or change the way that API works with the email then then they'll get it and so often that's not the case right and so for you what I'm hearing is it wasn't about selling this tool you had already built to a developer to make their life easier it was selling it to a non-technical SAS founder to give them access to what you're doing in the first place but that's not a product change right not a massive one anyway that was just a positioning pivot yeah absolutely it was just finding a a new audio audience um that the same product served equally well if not better and we're we're still going through that we today our customer base is like literally 50% half developers 50% sort of no code Founders um but we are constantly looking at who can use this product that's an attractive customer and where can we find more of them and and right now believe it or not one of the answers to that question is um like professional or trade organizations for specific industries that charge membership fees that's not at all the customer that we set out to serve but you know like the United States engineering Association has been around for 50 years it's got a huge membership they pay dues every month um there's all these little pockets of customers that that can use outsa um that are you know in interesting for various reasons yeah that's a good one to chew on for Founders listening to this like your product problem might not be a product problem you might just be giving the right value prop to the wrong person yep that's interesting yep and I and I think even beyond that too like just what I said about the product maturing and the developers sort of running back it wasn't new features it was just the existing feature set becoming more polished and sort of more mature um which is interesting too that's a wild journey man so you have spent seven years bootstrapping a business out of the 5K Mr pain cave into a pretty healthy Place profitable cool team running super unconventionally no meetings everyone's building Everyone's an owner sounds like Utopia man that's uh that's pretty neat pretty cool it's not it's not Utopia yet um you know we we definitely uh have a lot of work ahead of us to achieve the things that we we want to achieve but um having been through all of that to sit here today and say that we're profitable and you know have a team and are giving those people a lot of flexibility in their lives and all that stuff um you know I I feel like I came out the other end and pretty darn happy about it that's cool well on the topic of things to make you happy I'm not going to let you off this podcast without finding on finding out what's going on between you and Tom Brady because that's what I need to know you wrote a children's book yeah I did um it it's kind of like this you know for most the people in the tech industry they they sort of look up at Tech mountain and they see Elon Musk at the top um for for me when I think about the human species and the person at the top of that mountain uh it is Tom Brady I'm a New England Sports Fan and uh yeah one day I I have a writing background uh Tom Brady had just won his I think his fifth Super Bowl at the time and I just like scratched out on pen and paper a children's book and then I you know turned to fiver and found an illustrator and next thing you know it's a product and uh just the whole experience of figuring out how to write and publish a children's book was was pretty interesting but I have parents all over New England that buy this for their kids uh for Christmas and like send me pictures and stuff and it it's kind of fun dude that's awesome and that's at the tale oft tom.com T of.com that's it yep that's cool Jeff where do people go to uh to find more Jeff in their life yeah uh out.com if you want to check out the product otherwise uh Twitter or LinkedIn is probably where I hang out uh the most I'm at Jeff T Roberts on Twitter and I'm a G off so it's GE FF got it we'll drop that in the uh in the notes for everyone cool um cool man uh final question I wrap every podcast with or at least most of them um I feel like we've talked a lot about about goals and about life and and just you know some of the the existential components of running a business with other people sure um so my question is this if when the when it's all done the page is turned yep if you could be remembered for one thing what would it be yeah um so I'll give you two parts of this a lot of people after they hear about how we run the company ask like what is what's your end goal what do success look like and I don't have a really clear picture of that to to be honest um what I have started saying and and I think it's directionally true um if we could build outa into a $10 million a year business with 20 employees I think that would be Fant fantastic um that would mean if we do have an exit of some sort it would be a sizable exit that would mean we could pay everybody on the team great we could really invest in the the product in significant ways I think the business really works if we can um get to that point so I would call that a success uh if and when we get there beyond that for me um I think you hear a lot of people talk about impact and you know they want to facilitate entrepreneurship for a million people and there's always this big number um for me it's not a big number for me the whole point of operating this way um is in my mind the business exists to serve our employees uh and a lot of people don't like when I say that either they say shouldn't the customer come first my mindset is building something great for the customer is a prerequisite to be able to do the things that we want to do for our employees so yeah in short success for me is we've got a team of 10 to 20 that look back one day and say to me and the other co-founders you built something special that enabled us to do the things that we wanted to do with our lives thank you if 10 or 20 people say that to me that's a huge success it's a good one to hang your hat on man that's awesome Jeff I appreciate you coming out and sharing man it's a uh it's a great story if how you've navigated through everything dude and I that is like I said super cool super unconventional and I uh really appreciate you sharing point of view man so thanks for coming on thanks for having me this was fun [Music]
