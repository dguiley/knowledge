that 26% of young men who were exposed to gambling develop some sort of gambling problem that seems very high the NCAA whose new president Charlie Banker was just shocked by the gambling activity he was seeing on campuses commissioned to study to see how many people were doing this and more than 60% of young men on college campuses their Sports gambling so you do the math just like you got we're like it's almost like we're creating a pool of future gambling atct [Music] Michael where does this podcast find you smok tree Ranch off the side of Palm Springs which is a a gated community created by Walt Disney and some of his pal way back wi Wow Let's bust right into it in the latest season of your podcast against the rules you investigate sports betting which we talk a lot about here on the pod which you refer to is a great social experiment walk us through the state of play of this experience and where you think we're headed so in 1992 Bill Bradley then a senator created a essentially a federal ban on sports betting it Exempted Nevada but basically was been against it was against the law and the Supreme Court repealed that in 2018 and the new law of the land is states can legalize it if they want to and 39 states have and about 2third of the American population has access to sports betting on their phones about onethird still doesn't and the industry here is dominated by two companies FanDuel and DraftKings um they have a little hard to say exactly but say roughly 70% of the market and they were before they were Sports gambling companies they were daily fantasy sports companies which gave they actually was the perfect the perfect thing to be before mobile Sports gambling is legalized as a daily fantasy sports company you know all the customers you have data on all the customers uh Sports bets in America have Skyrocket it's a little again a little hard to say because it's hard to know what numbers to trust because there was a there was an illegal Market that presumably is not quite as big as it used to be but but it's gone from the legal Market has gone from a few billion to over a 100 billion a year and there's just starting to be some academic research showing uh the the social effects of this I mean it's kind of cool this the way it's rolled out has created these natural experiments that you have because you have states that are side by side one has legalized it one has not legalized it so you can sort of you can sort of tease out the the effects of legalizing it but bankruptcies are up savings rates are down if it follows the path that it followed in the United Kingdom in Australia suicide rates will be up so there's some social costs to it all but I think like really early days I mean you know it's only been legal for six years the companies have really only been up and running in Most states for just a few years uh it's kind of not hard to make some predictions about where it's going but it's not there yet I'm a glass half empty kind of guy but you s you cited some stats I've seen 20 to 30% increase in bankruptcies in States illegalize it I see young men with kind of less structure in their lives who are more prone to addiction I think six out of seven gambling addicts are men my understanding is gambling has the highest suicide rate because if you're addicted to meth people figure it out and try and intervene you can get in way over your skis with gambling and nobody knows and you decide there's only one way out I'll use an academic I think this is a [ __ ] disaster your thoughts yeah I'm totally with you this is why I was Dro to the subject I couldn't believe well look once it's legalized I'm a little a little shocked by the insensitivity of the social to the Public Health crisis is going to trigger um because it's this essentially Wild West in how you can get to the customer customer and they aren't you know the sports gambling companies they were mistaken for Casino companies when that people kind of thought oh it's going to be like a casino business so that uh the the kind of viig what the house takes about roughly 5% it's always been kind of 5% remain kind of 5% this number keeps going up with these companies they're they're like it's like at 15% and effectively what they are doing is mining the entire US population for people willing to make stupid Sports bets and they have a finely honed ability to identify anybody who actually knows what they're doing like the sharp Gambler someone who actually might have some Edge in a sport and and toss them out or limit them to the point where they're effectively tossed out so that their business is built on people who don't know what they're doing and it's further in a way that you know casinos when you're in a casino course is manipulating you in all kinds of diabolic ways but when the casino's in your pocket it's like your whole life is in the casino kind of thing and they have an they have an ability to sort of like nudge people into doing stuff that they just wouldn't think to do it's it is and it's making the dumber and dumber bets when you kind of think about okay like what's the disaster going to look like it's not just men it's young men uh young men young men are the are the real Target um the Lance the medical British medical publication just came out with study that said I mean this number is so high that I I want to just pause before I say it but the 26% of young men who were exposed to gambling develop some sort of gambling problem that seems very high but even if it's half that it's like the NCAA whose new president Charlie Baker was just shocked by the gambling activity he was seeing on campuses commissioned to study to see how many people were doing this and more than 60% of young men on college campuses their Sports gambling so you do the math it's just like you got we're like it's almost like we're creating a pool of future gambling addicts and you're right it's very interesting you're right about like when you think about what's going to stop this train if you compare it to like opioids like opioids was able to run for 20 years uh before anybody really put a stop to it and and and 750,000 people die and it was about as visible an epidemic as you can have this is it's it's it's invisible you don't see what's happening to people until so you wonder if it takes 20 years for the society to get its hands around the the opioid industry how long is it going to take it to get its hands around the gambling industry so I yes I agree with you it's like how on Earth do we let this happen but it's of a piece with other things we have let happen I mean when I think about it it's not only my fear is not only about gambling addiction but when you put kind of an ond demand dopa bag in young people's pockets just as they're kind of hardwiring their brain and learning about life and reward that we're just setting them up to be just [ __ ] dopa monsters and if they can't get it from gambling because they run out of money they're going to find it somewhere else have you seen any my thesis is we are literally unleashing into the economy into the world millions of dopa monsters that will are just going to find whatever way they can opiates sex porn online shopping they're just going to be so hungry for that rush because their brains will have been wired to expect that Rush that it's it's going to have all sorts of ramifications outside of gambling am I catastrophizing here I mean it doesn't sound unreasonable to me my first thought when you started down that little path was it's interesting that Sports used to be a place where you learned the slow rewards that come from gratification yeah yeah you learned the opposite thing and that we're turning that this mechanism that used used to take young men and teach them a certain lesson were you taking it to teach a different lesson so it was disturbing enough to me that I have a seven my youngest is a 17year old son like I gave him some money and and adult supervision so he could learn how to navigate this world because it does feel like you not only are we creating a world of of you know dopamine addicts but the signal you send especially to young men because they're so susceptible to this is the world actually doesn't give a [ __ ] about you that it it's it's out to get you when I got into this when I started working on the story that what motivated me was the book I wrote about stuff I've learned on the book i' written about the pandemic I got interested in it because the US response in the beginning was so just so appalling we had like you know 20% of the world's deaths with 4% of the world's population in the first six months and and I learned in the in the process that this was that in the few years running leading up to the pandemic we' had experienced a decline of life expectancy in three straight years and that had not happened since 1918 and I thought well the pandemic's happening in the context of a society that's already not taking care of its people that some there some basic failure is occurring uh and this feels like part of that that it's like it's a public health problem and that that it's not that hard even if even if you can't do anything about legalizing Sports gambling uh it's not that hard to do some things to blunt its effects so here's my solution I'm trying to work within the constraints of the society I don't think actually me going off about how diabolical it all is is going to help anything they're doing something that I think is kind of interesting uh the the company the sports gambling companies they are because they're so good at chucking out of their businesses anybody who knows what they're doing they're isolating people who don't know what they're doing so by definition if you have an account in good standing at FanDuel and DraftKings and you're doing a lot of sports betting you have signal to the world you don't know what you're doing I think that if we get that message out out and that if you say like if you're looking for someone to manage your money the first question you should ask them is they have account good standing at FanDuel and DraftKings if they do you should never give them your money to manage like like that if you make it if you make it a point of shame that you're in good with the industry that you might stigmatize it in a way that makes it less dangerous we'll be right back your book going infinite you fell under some of what I call the same texture of criticism as Walter isaacson's biography on Elon Musk and that it was you were kind of seeing lcly as having a front row seat but not seeing what was going on do you think that's a fair criticism I didn't write it until after it all collapsed when I sat down to write the first words I there wasn't much I didn't know had happened I mean very little happened came out in the trial that wasn't already kind of known but it is true that I was there a fly on the wall from kind of end of 20021 through the collapse of 20 in November 2022 and if you'd have said he has the money the customers money in Alam I would have said you're insane there's no way that would be so dumb so I did poke everybody did this everybody who s saw the structure of the business he's got his own Private Hedge Fund on the or trading firm on the side of an exchange and he owns them both I did ask lots of questions about conflicts of interest but what I imagin would be the problem wasn't the problem I imagine the problem was that his trading firm would have the same sort of privileged access to the exchange that highfrequency Traders get on the New York Stock Exchange and privilege access to data and so on so front running whatever and that wasn't the case I did not see that like oh yeah the money's in the wrong place did I in retrospect think I should have seen it no really no one else saw it either you know there wasn't the interesting thing there are many interesting things about the story but one interesting thing is yeah a lot of people said I wonder if they're Shady like FTX but that's the in crypto that's easy like as a heuristic if you're if you're a successful crypto business you're you know you're largely unregulated and you're 26 years old and no one's paying that much attention the specific criticism oh he's got the customers money in his hedge fund no one said zero people said so not even any had whatever 10 something professional investors who owned a piece of them and they didn't say it so I don't know I don't know that would have been very hard I don't know how you would have detected Ed that well a couple followup questions there so when I'm sort of follow the story a little bit from an adjacent I actually bought claims I know this you bought the claims and and if I could have I would have oh really oh my God I mean it just seemed pretty obvious that they weren't worth 10 cents on the dollar well I wasn't that smart I bought them for 23 cents but because it's better to be lucky than good because of the Surge and crypto they're now probably you're the payout is going to be somewhere between 120 cents on the dollar and 150 cents and other than other than patting myself on the back for one of the few good investment decisions I've made in the last year I if everyone gets their money back now granted he committed fraud he he took customer accounts from people who thought they were investing you know putting their money in a deposit not even investing and then he used it to take risk they had not signed up for so that's illegal but one given that everyone's giv their money back given I I don't understand the difference between what Sam bankman free did and what John Corzine did at MF Global I think it was called you're you're taxing my memory there but yes remember that yeah I do remember did the same thing can I back you up a sec because I really wanted to ask you about this I I I was I take took a keen interest in uh the market in claims on FTX because because it seemed really clear to me that what the bankruptcy people were saying are signaling that it's like it's it's this dumpster fire and there's nothing there and boy just be incinerated all this money uh that that that wasn't true and it was amazing to me how cheaply these things traded at first how did you how did you even think to buy claims I'm fascinated by I've invested across every asset class from Angel to venture to growth the public and by far the best asset class is distress because similar to biology people don't want to hang around old people so the best businesses are businesses dealing with old people and the best asset class is distress so I look at bankruptcy filings and I was fascinated by this I got the bankruptcy filing from the court I read through it and in the bankruptcy claim it listed all their assets cash some Bitcoin Etc and one of the assets that just popped out to me is they had invested $500 million in anthropic yep anthropic is the number two AI company llm and I couldn't find for the life of me what the valuation was that they invested at but I figured it was somewhere between three and five billion so I took the most conservative which meant uh number which meant that one of the things that the that FDX the bankrupt FDX had that would ultimately be distributed to the claimants was 10% I assumed of anthropic I valued anthropic at four uh at approximately um uh approximately 40 billion so I thought the stake is worth 4 billion claimants total claimants 9 billion so just the at stake in anthropic I valued at 44 cents on the dollar claims were selling for 22 cents to me this was the easiest Trail ever met and why do you think other people didn't make that trade occasionally you find something I don't this doesn't happen to be very long I'm like oh my God they've missed it and that is people didn't see the $500 million number they could see the $500 million what they couldn't see was the numerator the denominator and that was the valuation they invest that they invested at and I thought there's no way they don't own at least 10% of this thing and then you have to Value another unknown and that is what is that 10% now but I thought it's worth probably 40 cents a minimum 23 cents so all the crypto all the cash everything else was just going to be gravy to my bewilderment people weren't paying attention there was I mean what he did he didn't take whatever it was $1 billion of customer assets and spend it on you know blow and hookers and private jets he put five billion of it into into Venture Capital Investments and this was just one of them and he there was there was this pile of stuff and I keep waiting for someone to come and ask the question how good a VC was Sam bankman freed he was doing it El he was you know like how how well did he perform compared to his peer group because it wasn't it he has a piece you may not even know this he has a piece of SpaceX in there he has it through Michael keas but so you don't see it but he's got he's got pieces of some really valuable stuff even if even if crypto goes to zero and and never mind all the crypto business businesses he bought so so the so one last question on this because I it I'm just I'm curious because I haven't because I knew you made this trade someone told me about you being in the market and I thought well that's kind of that's kind of cool did you worry at all that the bankruptcy process itself was going to incinerate your profits that it was so expensive it would be so expensive that you just you wouldn't end up see you should have seen the money but in the end it would go in the pockets of Solon and Cromwell lawyers uh that's that's a great question but part of the analysis I did when I put together the spreadsheet was it's the same administrator that handled Enron and I estimated the cost at about a billion dollars and I thought okay if if just the anthropic stake is worth four billion the coins are worth three I saw 70 cents on the dollar and then take out a billion so 60 cents on the dollar and then what it ends up it looks like the payout and a lot of the stakes we're talking about have already been sold but it looks to me what they're saying the court administrator saying that they now think they're going to get somewhere between 120 and 160 cents on the dollar a lot of that because crypto has surged but the lesson I take away from all of this and this is a larger lesson about investing in life is the greatest return on invested capital is inversely correlated to how sexy something is this isn't true of sports which you know better than me because there's no shortage of billionaires with midlife crisis and it's a regulated monopo that control Supply but generally speaking outside of sports the best asset classes are the least sexy and this was a really unsexy investment everybody thought this thing it had fraud it had crypto which was out of Vogue this thing was supposedly going to zero and any reasonable diligence said no this is this is all upside you've taxed my memory about what John Corine did but I do think what do I think I think that there's a kind of misapprehension in the general tenor of the response to Sam bankman freed that the IT people still talk about it as if what he did was intentionally set up a business to steal customer money stole the customer money and the customers don't have any money now and um what he actually did was set up a business that was I mean it was janky set up in the first place but it was clearly not start didn't start as a fraud uh was in and of itself a successful business if he just not done the idiot things he'd done with his hedge fund and and then got himself in a pickle in June of 2022 when crypto lenders asked for the1 billion do they lent him back and instead of just telling them I don't have it I put it in VC Investments use the customer money to fill the hole and that was a really stupid thing to do it is fraud but it's it's it's just it's different than like evil person sets out to do evil so how I feel about I feel sad about him mainly and I think that what his his like the thece the character flaw if you will or the pattern it's more the pattern in his character that leads to this Behavior it was that was visible in every other aspect of his life and it was a pattern of foisting risk upon other people without their permission and he did it he does he did it over and over he did it in his romantic life he did it in his friendships and he get comes by this Vice honestly I think he himself is sort of numb to risk and kind of thinks he's right all time anyway so he didn't actually probably completely grock the risk that he was fisting on others I thought this is all going to work out um that was stupid and a crime but I can understand how he got there and I do have a problem with 25 years in jail I think like okay jail that that makes some sense but like I mean I don't know I don't know how you even measure these things but it's like fory like that is almost a death sentence yeah so I just don't I think that's excessive and I don't get it but people will argue with me but I want to put forward a thesis because you're a Storyteller and just love the way you think through stuff I would argue and I want you to respond to the CIS that the difference between playing golf at Centennial and going to Wimbledon which I imagine I would be doing if I were John cor on right now I don't see a lot of difference in the criminal Behavior here the difference is a is brand management and and that is where you have with s bankman freed is a guy who had this kind of floppy I just ruled out of bed crypto thing he's purposely set up this organization in the Bahamas which felt sketchy he was sleeping with and doing drugs with his co-workers he decided to go on the most ridiculously ill-advised apology tour which entirely backfired whereas Corine listened to very smart people who said Shut the [ __ ] up nobody speaks to anybody but your lawyers go quiet act like the victim you didn't know what was going on act contrite you were a terrible fiduciary you had no idea as opposed to going and speaking to Andrew Ross sorin in cargo shorts in cryp the difference between Corine again going to Wimbledon and bankman freed with a live sentence is poor Communications and brand strategy your thoughts well you're absolutely right that that the way he handle it for the minute it all fell apart was catastrophic uh you got to remind me what John Corine actually did because I don't remember MF Global uh customer deposits it ends up were being used to make speculative investments in the market John Corzine my understanding is thought interest rates were going to head one way and he claims he did know these deposits were being co-mingled it was pretty much the exact same crime it also speaks to the m to the moment that that there's a frustration with the ability to get our hands around the necks of rich people who do bad things and when you get a live one now the the the the sort of the speed with which the justice system leaps into action is is incredible Sam was really easy to prosecute so think about this I I always stop myself just short of thinking he has a Death Wish because his behavior kind of suggests it and he even when things were good um he was always extremely vulnerable like no bodyguards no you know you could sneak into his office any hour of the day you could he really was he was he there's a sense that like he doesn't protect himself almost willfully and so that just extended into what happened in the legal process so Michael I love this and you're a fascinating Storyteller just a couple questions to wrap up here I find one of the most fascinating characters in all of us was is it Carolyn Ellison Caroline Ellison Caroline Ellison any inside a lot of people didn't think she she ended up being what a my descript or I think the southern district called her the the ultimate perfect example quintessential government witness but they put her in prison we know a little bit about Sam we know almost nothing about her what were your impressions or what what was can you provide us some texture on Ellison she was a a math kid who thought of herself I think she's kind of there was a bit of a split personality thing going on with her she she had a lust for a stable and normal life and at the same time thought of herself as someone who would do radical and crazy things and was she she in college joined the effective altruist movement and and seemed to be kind of all in on that and I I tell you she was very susceptible to the charms of Sam bankman freed here's texture for you she told a colleague this didn't even make the book but she told a colleague that even after she and Sam had broke off their relationship it was worth her having sex with Sam because it made Sam more efficient and making Sam more efficient was the best thing she could do for mankind because Sam was the person who most likely to save Humanity so um that gives you an idea of how she is I'm gonna try that in a bar just this you this to the world will be a better place if I'm more relaxed tonight so this this will be the last question I promise you have I I look at I mean granted I you know my Idols are different than most people's but I look at you and I think I want to be this guy you're just doing cool [ __ ] telling great stories writing interesting books going to movie premieres I think you make an exceptional living but by all at least from an exterior perspective you're in a great seat we have a lot of young men and women who listen to this podcast can you give us any one or two pieces of advice for someone who looks at you and thinks you know I'd like to be in that seat were were there any things that you wish you'd done more of or less of what advice would you have to your younger self well first off I never thought that way about what seat I wanted to be in I never thought I want to be that person I always just wanted to be me it's like the best me and and there were things that made me feel the best me and I could and writing was writing was one of them writing was the big one and I just thought I've got to do this so not trying to be someone else would be the would be one of the first things I would say another thing that led me to like lots of the good things that have happened in my life it's related it's like not paying attention to what you're supposed to be paying attention to like what everybody else is paying attention to if everybody else is paying attention to it it doesn't need your attention kind of thing what needs your attention is the thing that you're interested in that no one's paying attention to and no one encourages you to pay attention to like your FTX investment uh it that it's like oh there's something here and I really care about it and if you can find that and nobody else is there that seems like a lonely place but it's the go it's the golden place and you got to like lean into that rather than lean out of it like learn to recognize that moment where God I love doing this thing no one is saying I should be doing this thing no one else is doing this thing but I love Love It Go With It Go with that feeling it's great for an investor it's great for a writer um but I think it's great beyond that it's sort of like you're arbitraging your personality against the world uh that you are finding where you are special in the level of interest you have in something and um I that's when I find my subject matters are the most exciting to me when nobody the thing that troubled me most about Sam bankman freed as a subject is I was genuinely interested in him right from the moment I met him but it worried me that so many other people were uh and and the only thing kept me going was that I had this privileged view of it but what I really like with the subject is like the Oakland A's where nobody gives a [ __ ] about them but I see there's something great there and and that's that's the that's the stuff it's like that's when you know you're in the right place it's like you're there for some genuine reasons because there's no ingenuine reasons to be there arbitraging your personality against the rest of the world I love that Michael Lewis is the host of the podcast against the rules he's also a New York Times bestselling author of several books including the fifth risk Flash Boys and The Big Short in addition uh some of these have been made into great movies The Big Short Moneyball and The Blindside
