# 1000 hours human-first strategy

Published: 2025-05-15

I think the competition will get worse because um if we now like look at how Google or AI is crawling like the internet searching for information, this is already a big shitow, right? Because like since 2 years um everybody's pumping out like AI content like in a factory, right? And this makes the job of Google and also the eye search engines much harder to like separate what's good, what's not good, what is actually true information, what is false information, what is the source. Um, and this will be even worse like in the future. There is a very paradoxal game that we are playing which is how do we use AI as much as possible to be seen by search engine that will be seen by AI while while appearing as human as possible to differentiate from all the other guys that are using AI. It's just insane if you think about it. welcome and uh and thank you for taking uh a moment to teach me and teach the people watching about the changes in SEO with AI. And just as a quick intro, I'm working with you since quite a long time now for a client. We are both independent and work for clients and I've seen you firsthand building the SEO from like almost nothing to I checked recently and we had like 15 million impressions um in the last year and I also know that you are a good marketer and that you are nerding out a lot on AI AI agent and you are trying to understand the the next the what's next of SEO. So this is something I wanted to understand for myself and I guess a lot of people really want to know more about it. So I thought let's call Marius let's have a chat and see see what comes up. So maybe if you want to like give us from your side like a little brief of what you are doing and uh and what your what is top of mind now. Absolutely. Yeah. Thanks for having me first of all. Um really cool uh chance to like talk about the stuff that I'm excited about. So this comes very natural. So, um, this is excellent and thanks for the intro. I think that sums it up, uh, pretty well. Um, yeah, SEO and and, uh, SEO and AI and all of this. It's a very complex but also interesting topic, right? Because it's not only like SEO as in a marketing channel or marketing discipline. Um but I think what we're going to talk about today is like of course like also SEO but this goes ve also not very deep but a little bit into psychology like how people um are functioning right because this affects also like how they're using technology that is presented to them or available to them and I think this is one of the breaking points that we can um discuss today and that probably um will also help your listeners like to um understand like the little bit broader game plan how I think um yeah if we talk about SEO how SEO will like evolve in the next few years like how people will change their behavior and what we like as marketers or people who are working online can do like right now to be on the right track so to speak. Yeah. I mean we we we briefly chat about it but for myself I know that if I look at two three years ago I was having like plenty of tabs where I was looking for stuff I was interested in in Google and now it's like it became like what 10% 20% of my search and and I'm thinking okay I am I'm an quite a nerd and you know I love to dig into new tech so that's obviously normal for me But at some point everybody will will will do that. And what you just said is about like the how people interact with technologies. And in the end a search what is a search? It's like someone thinks of something and and they need to make a decision of how will they get the information and and now until not recently they had Google that was the best option. let's Google it or let's YouTube it. But now there is something else. You can go on chat GPT. It's the same. It's a one click and you can talk to it and literally you have an AI agent because now with all three coming uh came up recently which is like a very fast it's an AI agent that has access a lot of tool tools and it does the search for you. It goes on the internet. It finds everything and then brings you a summary of the information in the way you wanted to consume it. So I'm like, okay, if you're a business now, how do you think about that? Like how do you what do you do to to to prevent yourself from from losing everything you have built so far in SEO? Yeah, absolutely good question, valid question. I think you you gave a very um true statement like that you observed yourself and that you're aware that you are like in a bubble, right? So you're you're basically your job or what you're doing is like including that you stay on top of all of this, right? And and you know how to use this stuff and you figure out the ways on how to use it effectively. Um but this pushes you into like a top 2% of the overall population and using um these methods and I always like to think like from first principles or data if available, right? And right now, um, I don't have like the exact numbers. It's always hard to throw around statistics if if I don't have them on hand. But like Google search is like right now still 400 times bigger than um, GPT search. I think that needs to be clarified first. And I think this also could help like everybody to calm down a little bit, right? Of course, like we are at the beginning of a shift. It's happening right now. And we can talk about this um, and what to do, etc. to be prepared like for the future. But there's no need to panic, right? Um that's good to know. That's good to know. There's no need to panic. Um I think also like optimizing your web presence or like yeah your web presence so to speak um for AI. This is not that different from optimizing it for search engines because in the back end of course like these AI tools use search engines to like crawl and index the web. Yeah, totally. And you you came up with a already like a game plan. Um I know it's a as you say we don't need we need not to freak out but we were talking about it earlier and it's like sometimes it's tiring like it feels like things are we can't catch up with things even if you are constantly uh looking into what's changing it feels you never have enough time to to know everything. So for a business owner that is that has a lot of other things to do than reading newsletters and and and testing tools, it it's even worse. But there are things if we if we calm down and we think like okay, what's the next logical step that I need to do? Um there are things and you came up already with a plan. you you already went into the the research of what OpenAI released as the information for how business should uh show their products online so an AI can retrive them and understand them. um do you want to talk a little bit of that like uh what are the big steps to start thinking of the next gen of um SEO and AI? But I think the the core principle to to think about is like if there is a way to achieve a result in a more comfortable um and quicker way, right? Um then people will do this no doubt. And this is like the comparison to I Google something, right? So I search for a specific product and then you get a list of data and then you and your human brain you need to sort through this list, right? And evaluate is this good, is this bad? Need deep make a deeper dive into this topic. Make a new search as you said. Then you have like 20 tabs open. If you buy oh very cool case like yesterday the Bluetooth thing in my computer broke down, right? Um and I figured out okay it's really hardware failure right and um the the computer is already like five years old right um and I thought ah man it will break down more in the next few months so I need to get a new computer and like what I do um as a person I think similar to you um I go into I have not used Jet GBT but but like Gemini with deep research but same functionality as the O3 right it can research stuff and I just gave it my specs right so I just said um I occasionally host my own large language models. Therefore, I think I need a good um GPU and then I mainly only use the computer for work, right? So, no gaming is important and I want to spend like,500 bucks maximum and it goes on for like 10 minutes and researches all of the stuff. Gives me a very detailed list and the links to the stores where I can buy it. And I actually bought it today, right? the the PC based on on this research and you didn't double double check by going into blog articles you absolutely not um absolutely not and therefore I think we need to like um this like we need to separate the use cases right this is what I this is what I said so there are very so I I I knew what I wanted right so I had a very specific need and I just wanted it solved and I knew the the parameters and on how to get there right how how to give in the data and receive the products um and then with one view see okay this is matching in budget buy right shortest possible cycle ever conversion cycle ever but what I wanted to say like is this is 1% right so this is us we know that that this is possible and like how far we can rely on the information um that we get from the AI and what to input to make like the output better etc this is not true for for most of the people, right? But for to to get more practical, you are doing SEO content creations uh creation day in day out. Um you have teams that are trained to do that and at the same time you are someone that uses AI at the best of your capabilities with the last tools. So what did change in your business processes? Um how do you make the best out of AI without removing what I think is also like the I I say I say it because I see it but human touch is still very important in the work you produce in content creation. So how do you combine both? What did change and what what tools do you use and If we try to like go down to the bottom like as I said uh also these AI models or AI search engines um they they also do the same as Google or other search engines do they scrape the internet right they search for information they index the information um and then they just have a different way of presenting it to you as a user right one gives you a list other gives you answer in text or video or whatever format or or a hologram in 5 years I don't know uh but this is like the the mechanics that is behind it and um they are basically very similar right um only that uh I think the competition will get worse because um if we now like look at how Google or AI is crawling like the internet searching for information this is already a big shitow right because like since 2 years um everybody's pumping out like AI content content like in a factory, right? And this makes the job of Google and also the eye search engines much harder to like separate what's good, what's not good, what is actually true information, what is false information, what is the source. Um, and this will be even worse like in the future. Um, and I think we need to think like in this situation an old thing is like the EAT guidelines by Google. I think you are aware of them right if the listeners are not aware it's like these are rules by Google um you can search or GPT them if you want to but in short um basically this applies to all industries or areas of searches where your uh your money your health is affected right so everything that's really critical basically and um for this like Google has some really specific guidelines and for example this is that if you publish content you should have a author attached to this content. Yeah. Right. With his name and metadata and link to social profiles which are all like small things that Google uses um to identify like real humans or experts in an area. For example, if you talk about health topics, you need to follow these guidelines otherwise you will not be ranked um anywhere, right? So this would be like the first the first first thing. If you don't know um what the EAT guidelines are, then learn it, right? Yeah. The the fundamental doesn't change. No, this is one of the things that will be exactly the same because uh we talk about this later. So this is like the the the foundation, right? Your these EAT guidelines, this exactly what in the future will be more important to whatever crawler information retriever we use, right? Um, and then to make it worse, as I said, like people are pumping out now content on us, right? It's it's a lot. It's really a lot. Um, and this opens up the problem too, how can we like separate ourselves from the masses of information that gets published, right? And like if you think about it, it could be a really shitty cycle if everybody's using like these AI tools and they all learn from the same sources and we all want them to create content for us. not a very good experience and this is exactly where we need to start thinking right. So h the next very practical thing is like think about how can you differentiate yourself from the other people publishing information right could be product pages could be blogs um how can this be different okay people are changing their behavior so you said wait a minute not that fast we are still not not there but there is a more urgent problem which is currently the Internet is filled with a lot of content that is AI generated. So even though the change of behavior of using agents instead of Google will take a while, at some point there is a problem for brands to that actually create good content to uh compete with the the mass of content that is created not to be uh taken as a training data for copycats to to create content and people will also be bored at some point about AI content and will stop consulting blog articles. So it feels like it's a it's a tough situation for SEO in general. So if you have like practical ways uh to think about it and the things you mentioned, I'm really happy to hear that. Yeah, perfect. That's a perfect question. You you mentioned all of the challenges that are here right now and that will occur in the future and we can solve them all. I think um absolutely. So I think the one way to go about it like this is our way how we do it like starting from now on um is that very specifically what we do is like um we need to still do our classic SEO work right so we need to learn what people are searching for what are the search terms what are the questions and cluster is this and sorted all the the good classic SEO stuff right still all still same um and once we know this like we create still um of course with the help of AI the content briefings right so like what the very specific topics are subtopics etc what to talk about in the content that is created and now it starts to get different um once we did this um and I I explain why it's important um in in a second once we do this with the help of AI we go through the content and identify like um information gaps that are currently on the internet um so it it can use as the search engine um and identify this on its own right. If you if you are not into automation and stuff, you can use perplexity to um to get this information. But we need to know like the gaps, right? And then in the next step um also the AI does it because it's boring to to think about this. Um thinks about like from these gaps like what would make good questions for an expert on this topic, right? And it also articulates these questions for us. Um mostly these are like it depends super deeply on on on the industry that you're in right what the type of questions are. So I don't know like if specific examples would make sense now but the theory is important. So now we have like SEO briefing um content gaps and then also interview questions to an expert and in the next step what we do is like we have now um created like this interview outline right um and we do the interview actually. So we try to get every client of ours to like make the jump to video content also, right? So um we then once a month do like this video interview, right? So we have these expert questions and we talk about or we talk to them um to get the information out of their brain, right, into the recording. And um now it gets really interesting. Now we have like the second set of data, right? So once we have the SEO briefing and the SEO content that will be created and the video content um and there we have then now two lanes where it uh where it goes like we take the first we take the transcript of the interview that was made for for this month or for this period of content creation right and then we feed this interview back into the content creation agent that we have and basically in the second step um the task of this agent is to like understand like which parts of the interview matches like these knowledge gaps, right? Um and also if there's additional information for the other parts, just weave it into the content, right? And um if you understood like the the problem statement that we made like five minutes ago, you already start to understand, aha, okay, so now we we already now have like a content piece that is much more information rich than everybody else um could do, right? because they are all like refeeding the same AI content and even if you have like human content creators like they're googling they're reading stuff and then they writing it in their own words mostly and now we have like already a very interesting um piece of content right that has a human um a human touch to it and also a human opinion in it from the interview because we also formulate the question sometimes a little bit like provocative right to like get some really good statements out of the people. Um, and then this these are like minor things like beneath this, but for example, the there are quote boxes then that are created for the content. Um, and these are and of course like with the AAT guidelines together. These are all nice little hints, right? That this piece of content and this website has like original interesting information that cannot be found somewhere else. Basically, you want to push on um, EAT. So basically giving the current source engine more and more proof that you as a business owner or your client is an expert and at the same time give more human touch so the final user is more likely to enjoy the content. So you will you use video or audio I guess to extract what's in the the founders's mind and basically extract the only thing that AI doesn't really have yet is experience like real world experience and um and probably some kind of emotional um approach to it and you use that to increase your expertise. is from to Google and and the future search engine. Uh one question is mhm how do you present that because do you use the information and write the same kind of articles with only the blog quotes that you mentioned or would you try to say okay now SEO it's not only writing blog articles and making like good titles on your product pages now SEO is being everywhere and okay now we take that and we make uh a YouTube channel out of it and we make like a different shorts and we are on LinkedIn And we are everywhere to increase the global SEO and not only on on Google. Absolutely. This is the other lane, right? So now we describe like how how we go about like increasing the presence on your own website, right? How to make it different from everybody else to be considered as an information source also for the AI models. Um and then the other lane is exactly what you described. Exactly right. Like your mind got into the uh exactly right direction I think. Um, so now we have like uh this recorded video interview, right? Um, and we can repurpose this as we want to, right? So this depends a lot on on the business, but my advice like to everybody is get comfortable um doing video content because this is one of the last resorts I think um this will not be touched too early um by AI and still if like the AI is so good that it really is there's not much difference anymore. Um I it's just my prediction. I think like people will still prefer like to watch a real human being like talk and and give information on video. So um I think it's also starting also with like text content already. If it's done badly like people do not appreciate like reading AI. They do not appreciate going into customer support and it's obviously AI if it's made very well no problem but it's like 10% right of the cases where it's done very well. Um and I think video this is even like um a much bigger hurdle to be done by AI in the right way. I I I would say from what I um see every day is that there is something I mean writing without AI now as a business it doesn't make any sense like really financially doesn't make any sense you have way better output whatever you're writing I mean I'm doing a lot of marketing I'm doing like ad copies email it doesn't make any sense to to write it manually but if you give the right context and you give the the right instruction then you can have a very good result but there is one thing that is always missing really is humor. You know, like this nicely nice touch of humor that is not too too too big and slightly perceptible that makes that creates a smile. Not like a big laugh, but just a smile. And I I never found and I'm testing all the LLMs and I've never found one that is mastering that for now. So I I think I think we still have some days in front of us as human beings. And I really hope that actually the the video will will stuck because that that's the last thing we have. It's it's already like taken over by AI but I don't think it will uh it will replace we need to be there as humans and people still crave connection crave to talk with actual people. Yeah. So, um after this convers conversation, I can share with you like the prompting structure that we use, especially for content creation. Like these prompts alone are like 5,000 tokens mostly. Like they're super intense. Um you can get these LLMs to exactly write in the tone of voice that you want them to. um th this is possible already but but still like I think even if it can replicate like the best um the best author we still like if we go to the video content back back again this will be a huge differentiator on so many levels right so if you if you if you are able to create this video content and and you have it um yeah as as we as we discussed already we can repurpose it on all the channels right so we can get broader distribution um with This broader distribution also comes back again like the the increased um value for you as an information source because if you try to think at it from uh from a search engine perspective let it be Google or AI doesn't matter too much like if there is a piece of information on the internet which could be a product page blog page etc it's already very informationrich and you as a search engine already saw um it has information that nobody else has there's a real human behind it, a real expert with social media profiles and background in the industry, right? You already think, very good. I keep that in mind. Um, and if you now go through the internet, um, as you do every day as a search engine, right? Um, and then you discover, oh, there's also a YouTube channel and, um, there's a video to each topic that is on the website linked to the specific blog page with the human talking about this topic. Um this brings you to a whole another league than um a website or an entity if we want to say so in the internet right um is just giving out this information without the enrichment without the network of distributed like human approved human proof uh content basically. Um yeah so this is like this is like the production side of um of the things and then we can talk about another thing that I think is also uh very good and applic applyable very quickly if you want to go ahead I was about to no ask a question keep it in mind actually no I was just reflecting for myself and I was like that that's interesting what we are trying to do because as as marketers We want the marketers and business owners and whoever is watching this thinks in okay how do I use AI to do more. So there is a very like paradoxical paradoxal I don't know how to say it in English paradoxal game that we are playing which is how do we use AI as much as possible to be seen by search engine that will be seen by AI while while appearing as human as possible to differentiate from all the other guys that are using AI It's just insane if you think about it. It is. But but we do it right if we do it that way because we don't make it a closed loop, right? The closed AI loop, but we give in like our own valuable information. So for us, it's not that I I I see what what you are referring to like if it would just be a loop. This is the loop that I referred to right in the beginning. Exactly what you described right now. If you do it that way, you will make the world worse. Yeah. And I I think the only thing and after that all the rest is tools and processes and but the only thing that you you talked about and that you make right is you need to inject human stuff at some point that is not yet on the internet at some point in the process in the loop and reuse it as much as the best way you can basically. Yeah. I mean there is there's only so much information right? So probably we don't find any um any gaps anymore, right? Somewhere in the future. Um but then still like the the the personal opinion and the human in the background is a big enough differentiator to make this work. And then also like just just try to like think about what do you enjoy looking at and consuming, right? And then just try to think from from this principle. And I think what I describe right now um goes very much into that direction. So if we do this um content will be produced that is enjoyable to to consume. If it's enjoyable for humans um and we do the tech stuff in the background, right? Like SDAT stuff, it's also enjoyable to search engines. All right. So you wanted to go on something else that sounds like uh really interesting. Please. Absolutely. Yeah. This is basically the third lane how we can what we can do uh right now to even make our content better and um and and better to use. So like right now we have really good uh models with coding capabilities, right? And what we can also do is like if we created like this very rich content, very worthy content, we can go through another AI loop um and this time let the AI look at the content um with the lens of um how could this be enhanced or made even better if there would be a small interactive tool, infographics, something that's interactive, right? Um yeah. So like if you if you are selling like for example PCs right like I did um what you want to have like if you have a specific question and you land on a page and then you you have a very specific topic that you came to a blog for right so very specific topic about like for AI use cases right how to run locally LLMs on on your on your PC um and you have very specific question and then you have this blog post and then this blog post would have like a a small mini tool that lets you for example compare like different architectures and you just put in some push some buttons and you see the exact comparison that you want to have right maybe stupid example because AI maybe can also do this like with a with a deep research um but the the idea behind it is basically understand the context of the block and then come up with like a small interactive piece of code that can be written entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and just embedded on the page, right, natively into the browser. You don't need to install anything. Um, and what what this immediately will do is like if people are landing on your page, right, they came with came they come with a very specific intention, they have very specific topic or question in mind otherwise they will not come to your page. Um, and if they now find something that helps them to answer or solve um this problem in interactive way, they will start to use it, right? Um, and this sends back to to Google or whatever search engine we're talking about in the future. Um, that there's interaction on the page, right? It increases the time on the page which is measured. Um, interaction like buttons are clicked. These are all events that like if you're using Chrome, um, Google knows about it, right? What you're doing on the page. Um and this sends like this is like the gold like the gold metric that we can send back to to Google is like time on page and interaction um on the website because big identifier for like good page right yeah I so ju just to to make sure I understand you're using tools like lovable um replete cursor the all those coding tools this is I I think it's what you you're not even necessary Not even necessary. So you're you're just doing going into like you can go to Chad GPT and say okay here's an article that describe so some search I want to transform it in an interactive tool for the user please create this interactive tool in HTML so I can embed it in my article. I mean in reality um like the tools are not that important. You can do it with claudet 3.7. This works very well. Gemini 2.5 Pro works very well with the coding capabilities. Um the process is a little bit more complex. So of course you have like a base prompt of this um engineer basically that should analyze and then create like the the ideas for possible tools, right? Um but you need to adjust it a little bit to yourself and your use case. So it makes sense that in the beginning you feed it for example the brand guidelines that you have like colors, button roundings etc. So that it creates like the tools matching um to your brand and tone of voice etc. Otherwise it will be not so good like the result will be not so good. Um can we make a tool out of each article to increase uh uh usability like literally you you would do that like you would go on every performing article and maybe I guess you use AI for that. You say okay what kind of tool can I build for this article? Build it basically. build it basically if you give it like the brand guidelines and like sometimes you need to tweak it a little bit like with the different CMS that you're using like let it be WordPress or Shopify um like a little challenges that um of course on your website you have like code that is present already like for example CSS rules right that apply globally um and you would need to make the tool like use the existing CSS rules to not like create too many nested like um CSS stuff and bloat your website. Um, but if you're working with a web developer already, um, you could develop such a workflow and then just explain it to him and and tell him basically, hey, make sure that, uh, if you implemented on the website for for these posts, make sure that uses like the CSS rules that are already there and it's like 10 minutes of of time use. All right. Um, I see. So that that's basically this the last layer. I I would like to try to to summarize um if if that's that's okay and then after we can you can finish with some closing thoughts. But to for what I understand is if I go back from the very beginning we have something that is changing drastically in SEO but not that fast but it will. So, we need to prepare and and the thing we need to prepare for is how to get into the the good graces of the AI um agent that are screwing the web. But this is not that urgent yet. But in any case, this will depend on how we also get on the good graces of uh Google and being today because what matters is to differentiate and to show expertise and to make the content content that people really love and interact with. So that's why as the first layer, I don't remember if it was the first or not, but you want to in inject human uh intelligence as much as possible if possible with video so you can get out of the search engine itself, but then go toward like the the more broad world web uh worldwide web and you're on all social media and and you show expertise globally. So the the SEO will benefit from that. But also if you inject human touch, human experience, human emotion, then your SEO content is getting better. And you can do that using AI on your with your processes. And the last thing is how do I make the actual articles the the web pages the the the product pages everything that's on my website how do I make it interesting easy to use fun and for this we can also use AI of course and we can transform written content into interactive experiences and now we can do it very easily using using the the late last LLMs like Germany 2.5 that that you mentioned. So did I did I forget something? No, not really. Like if you follow this game plan, you will see gains now and you will survive the future, right? But but let me emphasize this like it's it's not that urgent but you need to start moving now, right? Um you should start to think about now how can I like fix all the technical stuff on my website? um how to make it really structured so that um crawlers like to crawl it and easily understand for example product information this is SEO best practices like lesson one right need to do it and then like if you follow the steps that you just outlined you're all set for the future like this this is where it will head um this is how you can like benefit from it in the future um no you summarize it like super well that's it that's the game plan, right? So, let let's work on it. Well, Marius, thank you very much for for taking the time and and this conversation. I learned a lot. Uh I hope the the people that are still watching uh now are learned a lot as well. Um yeah, and let's let's stay in touch and and talk about it in a few months. Let's see if the the AI search has taken over uh Google or not. Yeah. All right. We will see. Thank you so much. have a nice rest of the day. Thank you.
