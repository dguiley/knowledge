# Wilde Agency Positioning v2

Core identity and dual-track model.

---

## Core Identity

**Wilde Agency = Latest AI Coding × Expert Engineering Foundation**

Not just AI-assisted development.
Not just experienced consultants.
The multiplication of both.

**The formula:**
```
AI Coding Tools + Curated Foundation + 30 Years Patterns = Exponential Output
```

**Venture-funded mission, client-funded operations:**
- Client work funds the venture mission
- Each build advances both client goals AND platform maturity
- Not a services treadmill—a flywheel

---

## Dual Track Model

### Track 1: Venture Studio (Startups)
**"Apply to be a Pilot Project"**

For: Funded founders, pre-build or early-build
Model: Selective, scarcity-based
Value exchange: Various (see below)

### Track 2: AI Transformation (Established Business)
**"Custom Software Without Becoming a Software Company"**

For: $5M-50M businesses needing to modernize
Model: Service fee advance, we build and deliver
Value exchange: They pay, they get solution, optional IP arrangement

## Track 1: Venture Studio Pilot Program

### The Concept
Limited slots. Application required. Not "free"—structured.

### Application Models to Explore

**Model A: Equity + Milestone Build**
- We build to lean milestone (MVP, v1)
- They give equity stake (2-5%?)
- Attracts: Funded founders who want skin-in-game partner
- Risk: Equity often worthless, attracts dreamers

**Model B: LOI + Deferred Payment**
- We build lean milestone
- They sign LOI for full engagement on success
- Payment triggers on funding/revenue milestone
- Attracts: Serious founders, aligned incentives
- Risk: "Success" definition, enforcement

**Model C: Discounted Build + Case Study Rights**
- They pay reduced rate (50-70% of normal)
- We get full case study, testimonial, reference rights
- Attracts: Budget-conscious but real buyers
- Risk: Discount attracts wrong crowd

**Model D: Cohort Model**
- Accept N projects per quarter (3-5)
- Standardized engagement terms
- Scarcity creates urgency
- Community/peer element possible
- Attracts: Founders who want structure + peers
- Risk: Operational complexity

### Scarcity Framing
"We take on [3-5] pilot projects per quarter. Apply to be considered."

Not free. Not open to all. Selection criteria:
- Funded or clear path to funding
- Problem worth solving (market validation)
- Founder coachability
- Scope fits our sweet spot
- Not already over-built

### Application Captures
1. What are you building? (1 paragraph)
2. What's your funding status?
3. What exists today? (nothing / prototype / production)
4. Why now? What's the urgency?
5. Why us? (Shows they've done homework)
6. What does success look like in 90 days?

## Track 2: AI Transformation for Established Business

### The Insight
These businesses:
- Know they need to modernize (AI pressure)
- Can't hire developers (talent war)
- Don't WANT to be tech companies
- Have budget (real revenue, not investor money)
- Want the outcome, not the journey

### The Pitch Framework

**Pain points:**
- "Need to get on the AI train?"
- "Having trouble modernizing current processes?"
- "Can't hire top talent?"
- "Want your business to win without becoming software experts?"

**Solution:**
"We build the software you need. You give us an advance on service fees. You get the tool. We handle everything technical."

### The Model
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Traditional Model:                                     │
│  Hire devs → Manage devs → Hope it works → Maintain    │
│  (Expensive, risky, distracting)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Wilde Agency AI Transformation:                        │
│  Tell us problem → Pay advance → Get solution          │
│  (Fixed cost, no hiring, no management, no maintenance)│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### "Advance on Service Fees" Framing
Not "pay for development" (sounds like cost center)
"Advance on service fees" (sounds like investment in capability)

They're not buying code. They're buying capability.

Optional: Service fee advance applies to ongoing usage/maintenance/expansion.

### What We Build for Them
- Internal operations tools (replace spreadsheets)
- Customer-facing portals
- Workflow automation
- Data dashboards
- Integration layers
- AI-enhanced processes for their domain

### IP Arrangement Options
1. **They own, we maintain:** Traditional work-for-hire
2. **Licensed:** They get perpetual license, we can resell to non-competitors
3. **SaaS conversion:** We build, they're founding customer, others pay subscription

## Application Pages (Two Separate Funnels)

### Page 1: Venture Studio Pilot
**Headline:** "Apply to Build With Wilde"
**Subhead:** "We take [X] pilot projects per quarter. AI-accelerated development on battle-tested foundations."

CTA: "Apply for Q1 2025"

### Page 2: AI Transformation
**Headline:** "Custom Software Without the Software Company"
**Subhead:** "Modernize your business with AI-powered tools. No hiring. No management. No BS."

CTA: "Tell Us What You Need"

## Messaging Alignment

| Element | Venture Studio | AI Transformation |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Audience** | Funded founders | Business owners ($5-50M) |
| **Pain** | Burning runway on scaffolding | Can't hire, can't modernize |
| **Solution** | Selective partnership, lean milestone | Service fee advance, we deliver |
| **Proof** | "CTO of 3 startups, 30 years" | "We've built for [industries]" |
| **CTA** | Apply | Tell us your problem |
| **Scarcity** | Limited slots | (Less scarcity, more "we handle it") |

---

## Open Questions

1. **Pilot model:** Which structure? (Equity / LOI / Discount / Cohort)
2. **Slots:** How many per quarter? (Real constraint or manufactured?)
3. **AI Transformation channels:** Where do these business owners hang out? (Not LinkedIn startup world)
4. **Service fee advance:** What's the actual structure? Prepaid hours? Fixed project? Retainer?
5. **IP for AI Transformation:** Default to work-for-hire, or push for license model?
