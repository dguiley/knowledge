so one of the biggest challenges that I see as a psychiatrist is that when we kind of medicate problems away we can maintain an unhealthy way of like living life right so if I have like back pain and I start taking opiates I may continue to engage in the behaviors that are creating back pain so you were kind of asking how do you know you know when an addiction is is part of your journey and that's kind of the way that I see it is that yeah it's causing a problem now but it is also a signal for you to fundamentally make a change in your life so that there's something within you that is not jelling with the society around [Music] you Dr K where does this podcast find you I'm in Houston Texas Dr K how do you describe what you do I support the mental health of the digital generation and tell us about your journey you went from being a video game addict to studying to be a monk to later becoming a doctor H how give us a little bit give us some color on your your origin story so my parents are both doctors they're first generation IM immigrants from India I was born in Texas and grew up here and then uh basically like I was genetically Premed so I'm one of these like South Asian diaspora kids that you know was told like when I was 9 years old like my my dad told me and my brother he was like one of y'all is is going to be a doctor and one of y'all is going to be a lawyer and so grew up kind of genetically Premed really had no interest in it and so was like Premed as a freshman in college and then just completely started like spiraling so like I had freedom for the first time in my life like was playing video games a lot joined a fraternity failed out of like college basically was on academic probation had a bunch of fs and then my parents tried everything so they tried to like you know they tried tough love they tried being supportive they were like really good parents they just didn't know what they were dealing with so they didn't understand what was going on so after 2 years of of second year in college I was barely able to like pass my classes where were you in school do University of Texas at Austin and then uh after that I my my dad like was like look we got to do something like this is not working so he's like I think you need to go to India and this is one of the rare times that I chose to listen so I was like why do I need to go and he was like I don't know it's just nothing else is working so I I boarded a flight about one week later and went to an asham which i' had never been to before um and then really like the first two weeks were like some of the worst probably lowest point of my life and then after that discovered something amazing which was like when I was in college I remember being frustrated with myself like I knew I needed to like go to class all I needed to do was show up because ID missed so many days of class that each subsequent day of class I missed I dropped a whole letter grade so it was like if I miss one more day of class the highest grade I can possibly get is a b and then one more day was a c and one more so like over the course of 5 days I went from a to F and I just couldn't get myself to go like I couldn't understand why I would play games when I know I shouldn't I had no control over myself so what I found in India was a system that teaches you how human beings work where do desires come from um where what really is the nature of willpower what's the of attachment and I absolutely fell in love with it so I felt like it was kind of like an owner's manual for myself so decided to become a monk um spent seven years sort of focused on that goal would spend my summers in India and then my teachers would give me a set of practices they but they also said I tried to become a monk at 21 and they said you need to go back finish your school go get a doctoral degree of any kind doesn't matter how what kind and then when you're 30 years old if you still want to become a monk then you can take your vows so I was like okay fine so they're like go participate in the world for a little while and then if you want to you can come back so I would travel back and forth um study more advanced meditation and then ended up meeting my wife which I'm pretty sure my teachers understood that I wasn't ready to give up a my life yet and then ultimately decided to try to go to medical school and that was because one of my teachers said anything you try to do in the spiritual world is going to be way harder than anything you can accomplish in the material world so try to do something very difficult in the material world and that'll be training for a spiritual path so I had set my target on becoming a doctor um also because I wanted to understand like humans from the other side right so I learned this like Owner's Manual of the self but then like what does medicine teach us so uh went to medical school at Tufts and then realized I loved Psychiatry like towards the end I loved like sitting with people the mind is my favorite organ and then to the of my family um decided to become a psychiatrist uh ended up training at Mass General mlan in Harvard was faculty there for a couple of years so I want to go back there was a point to a certain point you and I have a very similar origin story I went to UCLA I think UT Austin are they're kind of similar big land gram Public Schools I also joined a fraternity I was 17 when I showed up to UCLA I had a lack of self-discipline I like you was getting a lot of FS I was on academic probation I didn't have video games like you did I wonder if I really and I didn't have porn if ID had video games and porn I'm not sure I would have I mean I was I went on academic probation and all I needed to get was a c average to get another two semesters before they would kick me out so I kept doing that over and over but I decided I while it was a kind of I don't know a fairly superficial life void of meaning as far as superficial lives void of meaning go it was pretty good and I was enjoying myself you decided to get on a plane for India like what what happened or what was your thought process I'm at UT Austin in a fraternity you know that's that to me sounds like a pretty good life even if you're not doing well academically what inspired you to get on a plane and go to India like did you hit was there in a moment where you hit sort of rock bottom or did your parents Force you like what happened there yeah so I remember I had a I had a conversation with my dad in our living room at like 2:00 in the morning it was like like it was like one of these conversations where he was kind of like done like not in a bad way but he's like look I've tried everything you know I I've tried being supportive I've tried tough love like nothing is working so he's like and he was like look your life is not moving in a good direction I I knew that like I mean sure in some ways it was a lot of fun so I I loved my first two years of college from a dopam energic standpoint but from like a meaning a purpose I was just sort of existing so that there's a really interesting um conception from existential depression which is that so existential depression is kind of like When we struggle to like look into the future and so we can't move forward in life so instead what we start doing is we start moving laterally so there's no point in moving towards something so I'm just going to spend all of my energy in the lateral Direction so this is like partying like partying never leads to anywhere video games never lead to anywhere so I was spending all of my time engaging in actions that don't lead to anything so I knew that something was horribly wrong like I was out of control like I didn't I mean I enjoyed let's say a 4H Hour Brick of my life but I did not enjoy a 4- week period like I was I wasn't going anywhere I understood that he understood that I now understand that this is all karmic too so so there was just like there were just no other options and I asked my dad I was like what am I going to learn there why and he's like I don't know and it was really interesting because I I think often times when we give guidance to Lost young men we never say you should do this and then they ask why and then we you say I don't know right we always like give them the answer at the very beginning but I think in retrospect something about that like really appealed to me that look you don't know what's going on with your life we don't know how to fix it but you got to try something how do you discern I drink a [ __ ] ton of alcohol I smoked a lot of pot but I never felt like I was an addict and at some point they were probably they were definitely inhibiting my academic Pro progress they probably I would argue that it was worth it it created a lot of friendships a lot of figuring out my limits i' you know I've often said I got more out of alcohol than it's gotten out of me but it also had it gotten just a touch more frequent I could have easily gone down a very dark path if you're someone listening to this right now and you're at college or not in college and you think I'm playing a lot of video games I'm drinking a lot I'm smoking a lot of pot I'm watching a lot of porn what are in your mind the signals that discern between what I'll call youthful if a bit Reckless Behavior or irresponsible behavior and when you are an addict and you need to do something so I I've got kind of two answers so one is like a psychiatric answer right so we say that impairment of function is what cause how where's the dividing line for addiction well if it impairs your function you have an addiction so if it's interfering with your academic performance if it's interfering with your job if it's interfering with your physical health your mental health your relationships that's the threshold of addiction now in your question I hear two things I'm not I have a psychiatric answer but then I also have like a life answer which is that sometimes addictions and I do a lot of addiction Psychiatry sometimes addictions are part of our journey so there's this concept of something called post-traumatic growth which is like you know you kind of say that you got more out of alcohol than alcohol did of you so I was addicted to video games but I started a company called healthy gamer because it's a part of my journey just because I had an addiction doesn't mean that and and you know people will ask me if you could go back and change something about your life what would you change I say honestly absolutely nothing because I'm pretty happy with where I am now and that even addictions where without my video game addiction I would not have walked the Journey of self-discovery that I did see we talk about addiction as an impairment of function but I think that mental illness is often times a sign that who we are does not fit with our circumstances so one of the biggest challenges that I see as a psychiatrist is that when we kind of medicate problems away we can maintain an unhealthy way of like living life right so if I have like back pain and I start taking opiates I may continue to engage in the behaviors that are creating back pain so you were kind of asking how do you know you know when an addiction is is part of your journey and that's kind of the way that I see it is that yeah it's causing a problem now but it is also a signal for you to fundamentally make a change in your life so that there's something within you that is not jelling with the society around you and that's kind of really like the way that I see some of these issues like addiction it's like addiction is a sign that something in your life is not going well you require some sort of external crutch to cope with all of the negativity in your life and the real solution to addiction is not just sobriety it's fixing all of the sources of those negativities that you need the substance to deal with yeah I like that and and and one of the the issues I have with the industrial medical complex is like okay you know doctors ATA and hubman who I think are fantastic I've had them both on the podcast have basically declared war on alcohol and where they see drunkenness for most people most young people I see togetherness I think there's an upside to alcohol and I find it's very binary the people my guess is my son plays and I'm going to speak specifically I have a 14-year-old boy and he plays probably about 30 to 60 Minutes of video games a day that sounds about right and I hear him upstairs and he'll let out this Battle Cry of he'll go I'll literally hear from the upstairs yeah and then I hear all his friends laughing and him laughing and them talking and its group dynamics and teams and learning how to lose and I actually think video games are additive to his life and it's as a parent at the same time there's been periods in his life where he'll he'll hide his phone and go into the bathroom and pretend he's not well and in the bathroom won't come out and I know he's on Tik Tok and it is really can this is a long-winded way of saying with kids or with adults I'm addicted I'm addicted to my phone I just am if I'm anywhere bored sometimes I make excuses to go to the bathroom at dinner so I can check my phone and I'm not proud of that but at least I'm old enough to recognize it and modulate it I really worry about the young male brain and screen time and video games and social and porn what do you think as a young man or as a parent you can you know what are some practices or best practices for ensuring you are trying to use these things in a positive way is your view put time limits on it with kids not under a certain age with with your kids what will be your approach to screen time so you know I one of the biggest challenges with raising kids with technology nowadays is that I think most of the advice is geared towards mothers and I think we don't talk enough from like a dad's perspective right so like if we look at single parent households more likely to be single parent moms and I think first of all if you're a dad out there the most important thing CU some of these problems like pornography are like problems that are going to be foreign to moms and foreign to daughters so age first exposure uh to pornography is usually on average nine so kids are getting exposed to pornography at a very young age and you know a lot of times like we don't really know what to do about it so I'd say the first thing to do is like talk to your kids try to explain to them no try to explain to them that they are growing up in a world where all of these apps like Tik Tok and pornography and all this kind of stuff all of these people have a goal to try to to addict you like that's their goal that's their monetization model so I think sort of sitting down with your kids and really talking to them about what impact is this having on your brain what attracts you to it right trying to really help your child exercise some like meta awareness about if you're sitting in your bathroom and you're scrolling ticktock like what's up with that why are you doing that like what's driving that and over the course of let's say one or two months really sitting down with your kid and asking them okay let's take a look at your like screen app usage so you've spent 32 hours over the last 2 months on Tik Tok how do you feel about that is this the kind of life that you want live months last two weeks yeah right so so average cell phone uses four to six hours a day average Tik Tok usage in 14-year-old males in the US is 17 hours a week yeah so this is like and really sitting down I think the biggest mistake that parents make is that we try to regulate our technology the regulate the technology use for our kids so we try to do things like limit screen time but instead what I think is way way way more effective is having your child understand why it's important from their perspective do you want to spend 17 hours a week on Tik Tok is this really the kind of life that you want to live and once you start to get to those kinds of questions and conversations and I find that like you know Dad's having these con kinds of conversations with their son you know how much pornography do you watch like you shouldn't ask do you watch pornography I think you start with how much do you watch how do you feel about that is this the kind of life that you want to live like and often times what we'll find is when you have these kinds of uh conversations with your kids what you'll discover is that your kids are being drawn to the technology because something is missing in their life the reason I watch porn is because I have a crush on a girl I'm 15 years old and I don't know how to talk to her and so then what a beautiful thing happens when you start talking to your kids about why they use technology what's going on there you'll start to uncover things that you can actually start to address and so then you know hopefully if you're you know you're you're a good dad and you've got a kid you can be like okay let's have a conversation about how to talk to girls and so I think this is something that's really missing we're all about regulation and taking things away instead of understanding what is driving the teenage mind to technology and offering it a healthier alternative I think I'm going to follow your dad's lead and put him on a plane for India I like that I I I thought that was that was a gangster move I and not only that I appreciate that you actually agreed I think that's such an interesting pivotal moment in your life what have you found especially with young men is the most common demon they're fighting that they need to address um where the the the addiction itself is just their attempt to medicate it what is the most common shape and manifestation that that demon is when they get to the real problem so men are young men are being blamed no matter what they do so the the basic problem is that we there's no way for a young man to win in this world that's the most common thing manifests all kinds of things I'll give you a simple example okay so nowadays we're all saying oh like men should be in touch with their emotions right like emotional expression is healthy correct and like there's no such thing as like good emotion and bad emotion right like these are all things we hear we say to young men so if I'm a man and I get angry and I raise my tone of voice is this considered an acceptable emotional expression no it's abusive absolutely you're yeah I feel I don't feel safe around you and now this the other thing that I see so much in in society today which I think is very very unhealthy your feelings of safety become my responsibility so I saw this all the time when I was doing you know working in the emergency room at Mass General we would get kids from Harvard and MIT and and university health services and stuff all the time and one day I was talking to the one of the chiefs of security at MIT and I was like you know a lot of p a lot of uh students feel unsafe and he said something to me that stuck with me so well he said my job is not to make students feel safe my job is to keep students safe and there's a very big difference so now what's started to happen is that if someone feels unsafe around a man that isn't their own unprocessed Trum traum that's not their lack of emotional regulation this now becomes the man's fault so men are now put in basically unwinable situations so women you can look at Global kind of survey data about dating preferences and things like that more than 50% of people who graduate from college are now women but the average woman wants uh the the male that she dates to make more money than they do that's just becoming an untenable situation so we're we we teach kids men boys it's okay to express your emotions but we punish them anytime they express their emotions we don't teach we say oh men need like boys need to do this and they need to do this no one is accepting responsibility for teaching men how to express emotions no one is accepting responsibility for holding the space for that kind of thing so we're setting a lot of fundamentally unachievable societal standards for men and then we one other thing young men and men in general are the only class in society that does not deserve help so there's there's such a systemic bias that if it's a man like so we say oh like it's not our job to help you so I I do think that young men are getting a lot of mixed messages um at the same time well I'll put forward some I think about this a lot and I'll put forward some other Theses and you respond to them [Music] um I think an even perhaps an even bigger issue is male involvement or lack of male involvement you had you're blessed you had a male role model that tried really hard showed you that he loved you was present in your life notice gave witness to your life and then ultimately helped you kind of get back on track and there's a lot of young men who don't have the blessings you had and without the presence of a male role mod model whether it's a coach whether it's an uncle that gets involved in your life hopefully your dad brothers that care about you for me it was my fraternity Brothers at UCLA they took an interest in my life they would I remember my you know I don't know if you had an your my big brother like four weeks into my freshman year is like dude you got to smoke less pot man you're you're you're going to fail out your first semester stop stop smoking stop getting high every night and because he noticed my life and I didn't have a present father but uh the absence of the absence of men being involved in young men's lives for a lot of reasons U whether it's family court whether it's male abandonment whatever it might be a lot of single family homes and we can go into uh go into the reasons or that's a longer conversation and also um a lack of Economic Opportunity for young men because so many jobs now require the skills that women are showing at a greater propensity and they've earned it ends up when we leveled the playing field they blew by us academically and they've earned it don't want to do anything to get in the way of that but it used to be one-third of jobs required a college degree now it's 2/3 women it ends up are better suited for college than most men so there's just a lack of Economic Opportunity do you see I see those two as maybe even being bigger causes for men trying to medicate than than the mixed messages they might be getting from society and women your thoughts so here's why I think men medicate so men are taught to be something called external problem solvers so this is the way we're conditioned so if the world is unhappy with us and we're a man we should step up and fix it right so if I'm married to someone who is unhappy with the amount of money that I make I should earn a promotion if I get a bad performance review I need to do better next time so what we're taught is men I don't know if this kind of makes sense but anytime there's a a negative event in life this creates an within me there's this external thing that creates an emotional response within me and the way that we're taught to deal with that emotion is not internally but we have to correct the external circumstance right so if I can get my boss to give me a good performance review if I can prove to myself that this person is an idiot then the the negative emotion goes away does that kind of make sense if someone disapproves of me and I feel shame the way to resolve my shame is to earn their approval and if I can earn their approval then the shame goes away so this is a huge problem this is why men I think turn to substances because we are not taught when when you feel shame we are actually conditioned to be to live up to the expectations of others we use an external tool from the outside it can be a promotion a drink of alcohol marijuana video games pornography we use things outside of us to manage and control our internal emotional state that's why I think men are three to four times more likely to become addicted to anything than women are yeah it's really back to your point about a lack of empathy I mean to a certain extent we don't have an Opia to a homeless crisis we have a male Opia to a male homeless crisis you know like as you said three out of four four out of five suicides when someone comes in with an addiction issue what I'd like you to do if you can is stack rank the addictions the addictions when they walk in the door you think okay we can handle this or an addiction walks through the door and think oh no stack rank house from what you think are most serious generally speaking to least serious or most addressable I should say addictions uh so my first answer is that I think all addictions are addressable because their root is the same this cycle of addiction which is I'm going to use this external thing to manage my internal emotional state that's common for all addiction so norov cow I don't know how to pronounce her last name um who who's the head of n imh or uh maybe the head of of addictions in the US you know she talks about illustrates this beautifully there are just a lot of common Pathways to addiction and addictions for anything to be addictive it needs two requirements one is to give pleasure and the second is to take away pain so in that sense there is a very common roote and common solution to addiction um as long as we can help people manage their pain in other healthier ways then we can conquer any addiction that's my belief that being said I think probably the hardest addiction to treat is probably body dysmorphia so when people get addicted to a version of themselves this is the hardest addiction to treat so anytime um I'll give you examples of this so like what is that mean addiction to a version of yourself when someone comes in and says I love marijuana not because it makes me high but it allows me to be normal I like the normal me the the hardest addictions I've had to treat are when marijuana make allow someone to participate in a normal life the way that all of the other humans do I've worked with people who have addictions to um things like stimulant medication like people with ADHD so they exist in the world they can't focus they have difficulty regulating their emotions because that's a feature of ADHD they struggle with issues of confidence and if they take Aderall they feel normal they feel like confident I love this version of my myself and I also see that in body dysmorphia where it's like I don't want to be grotesque I don't want to be ugly I don't want to be pathetic I want to achieve I want to be good I want to be proud of myself I want to be happy when I see when I look in the mirror and I I see myself this is what they strive for and what we know about genetics is like you know when you have an addictive let's say personality you may just have a drug of choice so you know your opioid receptors your mu receptors may just be genetically a little bit different in some people Gaba receptors which are for alcohol maybe a little bit different you know so you may have just a genetic vulnerability to a particular drug of choice and that's why human beings have drug of choice drugs of choice but the underlying mechanism of addiction is like pretty shared and the hardest ones to treat are when the substance allows you to be a version of yourself that you like and you don't like this over you we'll be right back I want to go somewhere a little bit more positive here one of the things you talk about that is really is super interesting is what science can tell us about the formation of relationships and falling in love uh what does the latest research reveal about how we form deep connections and how is technology reshaping this process or put more more basely how can someone today in this digital age find love oh so so hard so so first thing to understand is that you know we have birth rate crises in parts of East Asia I don't know if you're familiar with like the 4B movement in in South Korea and so there's like you know people are getting uh engaging in fewer long-term relationships we're seeing a lot of like situationships and Friends with Benefits people are there's a loneliness crisis there's a mental health crisis there's a dating crisis and all three of these things are correlated with an increase in technology use across Society so how do these two things actually interface so this is what a lot of people uh you know don't understand so falling in love if you really think about it is an addiction so what we know is that falling in love is governed by our dopam energic circuitry and let's just think about this right so if you're lucky enough to have fallen in love you are obsessed with this person so if we look at dopamine in the misoc cortical circuit this is the nucleus accumbent this is our addictive part of the brain dopamine does three things gives us pleasure gives us craving and reinforces behavior so when you're in love with someone you crave them you think about them all the time like literally like what happens in your brain these can best be described as Cravings they're preoccupations with this person and then when you're in this person's presence the presence alone creates dopamine in your brain so just like sitting there and being with them feels like the most amazing thing in the world so and there's also other things that we know about addiction so addiction also suppress the risk assessment parts of your brain so once you fall in love or your best friend falls in love they start to change who they are they start making stupid decisions and all of your friends get worried about you when you fall in love because you don't realize you're missing all of these red flags that's not a bug that's a feature so thousands of years ago millions of years ago when our brains were evolving they realized there were two humans one human who was able to accurately assess risk and one human whose dopaminergic circuitry was suppressing risk which one of them ended up mating the person who suppresses risk so dopamine creates impulsivity creates craving creates pleasure suppresses our ability to gauge risk and this is what Falling in Love is falling in love is stupid it's beautiful it's idiotic I mean I jokingly say that young people should go out drink more and make a series of bad decisions doesn't that mean we be a little bit more Reckless with our emotions yes and no so I think the way that we should correct this is by fixing what causes the root problem so the root problem is that when we use social media when we use technology it Alters our dopaminergic circuitry and those alterations once your brain changes from social media use or video game use or pornography use that same brain becomes more incapable of falling in love and so what I'll tell people like who are you know struggling to fall in love is before you go on a date walk for 1 hour and do not touch a device what I find is that people who do that the quality of their dates improves there's another really fascinating mechanism so remember that all social media and technology and all this kind of stuff suppresses our negative emotional circuitry and evokes emotional circuitry and one of the key factors for falling in love is shared emotional experience so this is there's a beautiful study that that that Illustrated this so they had a group of two groups of couples go on dates where they met on a bridge but there are two Bridges one is a stone bridge that's stable one is a Wood Bridge that's rickety and what they found is that when you meet in the middle of like a Wood Bridge that's rickety we're both a little bit scared and so since there is a shared emotional experience between these I think we heteronormative dates when you have two human beings that are both share the same emotion and we're both scared on the bridge we actually bind together a little bit the empathic connection becomes strong and when we meet in a stable place where there is not a shared emotional like State then those people feel less connected I I want to bring it down to kind of a ground level um and that is I think they'd probably I mean in addition to a good job and supportive parents and a male role model if I could wish anything more of on young men right now it'd be relationships not only friendships for romantic relationships only one and three men under the age of 30 is in a relationship two and three women under the age of 30 and you think well that's mathematically impossible it's not because women want more economically and emotionally viable men so they're dating older and I find without the joy and probably more importantly the guard rails of a relationship men just come off the tracks that women reinvest that energy in work and friends and Men reinvest it in video games and conspiracy theory your thoughts on limiting the amount of porn such that a young man quite frankly builds up more desire and is willing to take more risks in terms of meeting women or putting himself in a context or another man where he can take that leap of faith and endure the rejection take the risk thoughts this is the biggest problem that I see right now we are coping with our negative emotions instead of harnessing them so this is something that I want you to really think about why do human beings have negative emotions right so negative emotions are first of all much more powerful motivators of behavior than positive emotions curiosity will get you interested in something for a little while Joy will get you interested in something in a little while shame sadness and anger are incredibly powerful motivators now why are they such powerful motivators because these are the signals that our brains sends us to tell us we need to make a change if I'm ashamed of my body the solution to that in in the way that our brain evolved because we couldn't avoid people we were in like tribes of 300 so I had to see these people every single day that shame is a powerful motivator to change the way that I look change the way that I act and even this hunger for companionship this sexual drive which is one of the strongest drives in the human being overall is what causes us to reach out and overcome our shame and now what's happening with things like pornography and Technology social media video games is we are taking all of these negative emotions which normally are the power most powerful fuel to allow us to fix our lives and we're wiping them away with things like porn or video games and now what we're doing is we're disabling our primary motivational fuel which is negative emotion and you'll see this all the time like even if you look at movies right when when the hero becomes a hero it's not curiosity that makes him a hero it's a powerful negative emotion a sense of betrayal a sense of anger a sense of Shame I'm never going to be this way again never again I'm never going to be weak again and that's what drives them to change and so what we're actually doing is short circuiting our most potent motivational drives through things like pornography if you could give and I I'm and this is a difficult question to answer but but advice to younger men in terms of you know they're starting out maybe they're their first job or college as it relates to addiction as it relates to establishing healthy relationship any practices you recommend that are more likely to set them on a strong path what what advice do you have to um young men as it relates to recognizing addiction screen time activities behavior modification in a digital age where obviously addiction is kind of sort of one click away everywhere so I'd probably say that see the reason we rely so much on these technological devices and addictions is because we cannot tolerate life without them right so if we think about if I if I told you to take your your phone away from a day for a day it would be really hard for people to exist so one thing that we do in our community there's a beautiful meditation practice that we tell people to do which is stare at a wall for an hour and just look at what comes up so at the beginning you'll be bored and then like the the basic problem is that dudes today are trying to always move away from themselves and toward something I need to be sexier I need to be healthier I need to be more fit I need to have more friends I need to join a fraternity I need to be like these guys one of the weirdest things I've I've always heard is the men that I work with long for Rock Bottom they want no nothing more than Rock Bottom I want to hit rock bottom because that's when I know I'm going to die or I will be reborn they long for that more than anything else they just want anything except for this numb existence they would rather break it or make it one of the two but just no no more this limbo they hate limbo the way to get out of that limbo is is to first of all stop paying attention and stop caring about the world thinks because you're getting all of this contrary advice right so you know be a more masculine man so that you can attract women or be more emotionally available so that you can attract women make more money assert yourself or be more passive there's just no way that you can make anyone else happy like you've tried and it doesn't work so instead what you need to do is sit your ass in front of a wall and look at what comes up for 1 hour and what you really need to do for your compass in life is listen to what comes up because you've tried to make the rest of the world Happy it ain't working so stop trying and start trying to make yourself happy listen to the signals on the inside and try to make those signals happy irrespective of how painful it feels because you will get better at managing the pain whatever you do you will get better at the problem is that we end up trying to make everybody else happy avoiding all of our emotions and so then we become puppets to the world around us Dr Al look
