# Offer Refinement

Clarifying Wilde Agency's positioning, offers, and differentiation.

---

## Core Positioning

### The Vibe

**Not this:** "Anyone can vibe code amazing products now"

**This:** "What happens when deeply experienced engineers harness AI"

The difference:
- Vibe coders: AI generates code from scratch, fingers crossed
- Wilde Agency: AI accelerates proven patterns on curated foundation

**Why it matters:**
AI + blank slate = fast garbage at scale
AI + 30 years of patterns + battle-tested foundation = fast excellence

**Tagline candidates:**
- "Senior engineering, AI-accelerated"
- "Experience amplified by AI"
- "The foundation matters more than ever"
- "AI builds fast. We build right."
- "Vibe coding for adults"

## Offer Stack

### Tier 1: Development Projects (Core Offer)
**What:** Full builds on Wilde codebase foundation
**For:** Funded startups, businesses needing custom software
**Price:** $25K-150K+ depending on scope

**Value prop:**
- Skip 6 months of scaffolding
- Production-ready from day one
- Senior oversight on AI-accelerated development
- Best practices baked in, not bolted on

### Tier 2: Fractional CTO (Anchor/Decoy)
**What:** Strategic technical leadership
**For:** Teams that have devs but lack direction
**Price:** $15-20K/month (priced to rarely sell)

**Purpose:**
- Frames development projects as reasonable
- Occasional taker = great recurring revenue
- Positions you as executive-level, not contractor

**If someone asks:** "Most clients find more value in project-based work where you get my attention focused on shipping, not just advising."

### Tier 3: Dev Partnership (New Concept - Needs Development)
**What:** Build software they need, retain rights to productize
**For:** Established businesses threatened by AI/tech disruption
**Price:** They pay for development (at cost or discounted), we own IP to sell to others

**The pitch:**
"You need this software to compete. We'll build it for you at preferred rates. In exchange, we retain rights to offer it to non-competing businesses. You get the tool you need without becoming a software company. We get a product with a paying launch customer."

**Why this could be huge:**
- They're not startups (have money, real problems)
- They don't WANT to be tech companies
- De-risks our product development (paid to build, then sell)
- They become case study/reference customer
- Solves their AI anxiety without them hiring devs

---

## Dev Partnership - Concept Development

### The Insight
Traditional businesses are terrified:
- "AI is changing everything"
- "We can't hire good developers"
- "We don't want to become a software company"
- "But we'll die if we don't modernize"

### The Offer
**Partnership structure:**
1. We identify software they need (operations, customer-facing, internal tools)
2. They fund development as a customer (pay upfront or milestone-based)
3. We build it on our platform
4. They get perpetual license to use it
5. We retain rights to sell to others (non-competing)

**Economics example:**
- Their cost: $75K (discounted from $120K market rate)
- They get: Custom software solving their exact problem
- We get: $75K + product we can sell for $500/mo SaaS to 100 other similar businesses

### Ideal Dev Partnership Candidates
- Industry: Non-tech businesses with money (manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, professional services)
- Size: $5M-50M revenue (big enough to pay, small enough to be ignored by enterprise software)
- Pain: Manual processes, spreadsheet hell, can't find/afford developers
- NOT: Tech startups, agencies, anyone who thinks they're a "tech company"

### Questions to Develop
- [ ] What verticals have the most pain + money?
- [ ] What's the IP/licensing structure exactly?
- [ ] How do we find these businesses? (Not on LinkedIn posting about startups)
- [ ] What's the pitch to them? (Very different from startup pitch)
- [ ] Minimum viable partnership terms?

## Refined Pitch Elements

### Fame (Proof Points)
Pick 2-3 to emphasize:

| Proof Point | Impact | Use When |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "30+ years in tech" | Establishes depth | General credibility |
| "CTO of 3 startups" | Shows leadership + startup context | Startup founders |
| "Built systems at [impressive companies]" | Borrowed credibility | Enterprise/serious buyers |
| "Mature codebase refined over years" | Tangible asset | Technical buyers |
| "Boutique = senior attention on every project" | Anti-agency positioning | Anyone burned by agencies |

**Suggested Fame statement:**
"I've been CTO of three startups and spent 30 years building systems at [companies]. Unlike agencies that staff juniors, we're boutique—you get senior engineering on every line of code, accelerated by AI but guided by experience."

### Pain (Refined for Avatars)

**For funded startups:**
"Most startups burn 6 months and half their runway building scaffolding—auth, payments, infra—before writing a line of product code. Then they discover their quick decisions don't scale."

**For existing businesses:**
"You're not a software company and don't want to be one. But you're watching competitors automate while you're stuck with spreadsheets and manual processes. Hiring developers is a nightmare, and you've heard the horror stories."

### Aim

**For startups:**
"We help you skip straight to product. Day one, you have production-ready infrastructure. Week one, you're building features that matter. Month one, you're in market—not still configuring CI/CD."

**For existing businesses (Dev Partnership):**
"We build the software you need without you becoming a tech company. You fund it, you use it, we handle everything technical. You solve your business problem; we take the technology risk."

## Positioning Statement (Draft)

**For startup founders:**
"Wilde Agency is a venture studio for technical execution. We combine 30 years of engineering experience with AI-accelerated development on a battle-tested codebase. You get senior attention, production-ready infrastructure from day one, and software that scales—without burning runway on scaffolding or gambling on vibe-coded prototypes."

**For established businesses:**
"Wilde Agency builds custom software for businesses that don't want to become software companies. We handle the technology so you can solve business problems. Our AI-accelerated approach on proven foundations means faster delivery, lower risk, and no need to hire developers you can't find anyway."

## Open Questions

1. **Dev Partnership legal:** What's the actual IP arrangement? License vs ownership?
2. **Dev Partnership sales:** How do we reach non-tech business owners? (Different channel than LinkedIn/startup world)
3. **Fractional CTO:** What's the exact scope to justify $15-20K/month? (Even if rarely sold, needs to be defensible)
4. **Codebase story:** Can we visualize/demo the foundation? "Here's what you start with vs starting from scratch"

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Finalize positioning statement
2. [ ] Develop Dev Partnership concept further (separate doc?)
3. [ ] Create one-pager showing offer stack
4. [ ] Script the pitch for each avatar
5. [ ] Identify channels to reach "existing business" avatar
