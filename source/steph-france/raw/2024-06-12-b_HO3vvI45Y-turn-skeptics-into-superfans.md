# Turn Skeptics Into Superfans

Published: 2024-06-12

in this video I'm going to show you the complete process of a product launch via email whether you have a new business or you are launching a new product to an existing audience I'm going to show you the different steps that you can use to take your potential customers or existing customers to I barely know about your product to I can't wait to buy it and to do that we use several uh emails as understood one after the other uh in a certain period of time to create this kind of event emotional connection and make them wait for the product to be launched it is a quite complex concept to to grasp this is why I wanted to have different examples and to uh touch on different aspects of this concept the first part of this video will be me showing you uh a product launch I have done two weeks ago uh that generated uh 113,000 in Revenue in one week uh I will show you all the emails we have sent um every data point that we have on these emails I will show you the actual text that I've translated it was a French launch um but I've translated it uh in English I will um quickly show you how you can use the product launch to launch a new business rather than a existing audience um with the discovery quiz funel framework that you probably already know if you if you know the channel already then we are going to look at the the actual framework uh what's the delay between each email uh what are we supposed to send when and what are the other techniques that we can use to increase the engagement and and increase the the willingness for people to buy your product when when it's time to buy it uh then I have written kind of uh email marketing uh rule of thumb uh how to write emails that people want to read like The the general rules that you can use in the product launch but also in every single email that you write as a business um to make people want to read your imaage and not to be boring and kind of differentiate create yourself that is combined in the the product launch but that could be also a video by itself but I wanted to have it uh here with the product launch finally finally I will quickly talk about the tools that we can use to to create our launch and in the end I will show you the prompt I've created for you um to write your emails that contains all the knowledge that I'm going to present you now uh and that has helps you to engage with an AI whether it's jgpt or clo or whatever the the AI you are using but then you can easily U kind of brainstorm and create every single email of the sequence all right if that sounds good to you then we are going to start with the first parag the first chapter uh just know that the the figma file that you see here as usual you can get it uh for free in the description so just watch the video and then you can get go and and get it and the only thing I ask you uh to do if you like this video is to like um subscribe if you haven't yet and um and comment what you think about it uh if you have found it valuable or not let me know what I can improve okay let's go with the first part and let me tell you uh about this launch that I have done two weeks ago so what was exactly this product launch first uh the brand uh is an French e-commerce brand that sells blue jeans made from different eco-friendly materials and the launch was for a new blue Gene in a certain materials that we introduced to the oens actually we didn't really introduce it was the second time but after two years so it was a reintroduction about a blue chin the the interesting thing here uh it's not to look at the revenue because it could be completely different depending on the size of the brand it's more to look it to look at it uh proportionally to the current revenue and so here you have like that's the revenue during the week of the launch but that is the revenue from the beginning of the year almost the last 90 days and as you can see uh it's the average revenue is about like, EUR per day something sometimes there a bit more and then soon you have the launch uh so that's the day of the launch you always find like a huge bike on the first day then goes a little bit down then you reactivate it a little bit in the middle and then the last day it's the the last day to buy otherwise they cannot buy the product because you close the launch uh and so you always have a bike at the end and then goes back to the the normal route uh so that's for the the global introduction to to this launch um now what kind of emails are we sending um I just realized that I should have started by this chapter so I will just move around with these two right I would do the two at the same time if you look at the time frame uh here it starts I always do it uh in about a month uh some people would do it short in in a shorter period of time but I like to make it like uh to let people have the time to think about it and really uh look forward to the next email and to the launch so basically I start with the pre pre-launch email uh that is I I decide to do it on Sunday uh for this example and then the next email will be the announcement and why I will um go deeper on that just later uh and the Sunday after there is the how and what um same thing I will tell you about it and then the Sunday after you have the actual launch and then you have like um emails during the week of the launch and in the very end you have two emails during the same day that kind of close the the pre-order campaign or the campaign to launch the product um and after that they cannot buy it anymore um if we look at the very first email it's a teaser and here here like in every other email it's just about your creativity and your imagination how you can make people kind of uh understand that what will be the product that you launching but without saying it and the thing you are looking at here the you're looking for sorry is how you can make them engage how you can make it fun and entertaining for this example um I have used several things like like mini videos um quizzes to just make them guess about the product whatever in this case I decided to go for a story so sorry for the translation it's Google translate I just uh used that and took a screenshot so the English is not perfect but that wasn't really written in English at the beginning uh here I just came up with the concept of um the story of the the seed and how a blue jeene can be season matter if you uh look into what is happening when you plant the seed then you harvest then you start creating the blin and so on and so I just tell a story about a seed and in the end I asked them if they want to uh guess just by answering theil that's um first it's cool because you have a lot of answers uh we had few hundreds uh answer almost a thousand I think and and people engage so it's not one more email they have read and they forget about it's an email that they remember I've interacted with and wondering what it was about whatever the the kind of Engagement that you go for it doesn't matter it is just about making them think making them remember making them understand that something is coming up then you have the second email of the series so this this is one week after it could be shorter if you decide to uh but for this example it's one week after here we don't need that um the Y is kind of first you want to create the connection with the previous email then you want to announce the product in a sub subtle way and tell the why why you created it what what is the the the core story behind this product why did you have the idea to create it because at this stage you don't want to sell the benefits you don't want to talk about the price you don't want to talk about the features and and so on you just want to say hey this is what I'm launching this is why I decided to launch it and you want to connect with the audience you want again to tell a story I I'm going to talk a lot about stories because uh this is what we want is it's not to sell product is to tell stor and make people U realize that they want the product um so here is it's just another story to remember uh everything we have done before uh to create the first version of the Gene and everything that happened after I put some uh videos uh about this is not even a video about from the brand it's another video I found on YouTube just to to make them uh learn about the the the product to make them I remember um what happened two years ago and so on and so forth and so I finish by giving some um clue giving some hints so that they kind of remember how it looks um I I I give them some social proof from the previous product obviously it's if it's the first time you launch you don't have that but you know that's the concept it's just here if you have to remember one thing from this email is just you announce it if you have a picture you show the picture but then you just tell story you just explain why you created it the next email we are going to talk about the actual product then in the end of the the email you could read it uh later on I show a little video that we have made again um I talk about the video in the very beginning and I give the video in the end so it makes people want to go through the whole email and finally engage again and remember um about this email okay now the next one uh it's the what and how if you think that you attracted uh you triggered attention here with the teaser then you announced the product and let them know why you created it then now they need people need to rationalize okay that sounds really good the story is amazing but why should I buy it what's in it for me and and how much it cost and when can can I buy it this is exactly the goal of this email it's to uh gather every information that you have and put them all of them in an email here if you wonder what's that it's a it's kind of it's a joke because I've created a very very bad uh animation and so I made a joke about it uh but finally I give the pictures and then it's kind of FAQ so if you go down you can see that you have all the questions uh that are answered about the price Del time um and important thing here is to if you can is to create some tension about the product you want to create scarcity before even new launch you want to talk about how many people are already interested in and how many products are available maybe you cannot do that because maybe you don't have a lot of people interested maybe you have uh or maybe you you just don't have a limit into the product that you you can create but if you find a way to create some scarcity at this stage it's perfect okay this is the pre-launch you have three mails and the fourth one is the one where you launch the product and this one is extremely extremely simple because they know everything and the whole purpose of these three emails is that when they read the last one they already start their buying uh decision process they already think about it they know everything so the last step is basically to buy the product when they receive this email you don't have to to reiterate you can just point out the the main benefits if you want but in the end it's just about giving access to the page I'm not showing here in this video page it's another topic how you can create uh good offs and and create pages I have a video about landing page but it's in another kind of context anyway here it gives access to the product itself what is this email launch new sub if you think that for someone to be really able to uh buy the product here they need to receive this email for emails for three weeks so between the moment that you send the first email to the moment that you sent the last one you have one two three complete weeks if you are gathering subscribers then these people won't have the three emails so it won't be logical for them so they are kind of out of the launch sequence but you you want to give give a chance to them to buy it anyway so this is why I have the launch new sub email it's like I just reiterate basically what I've said in the previous one very shortly and say hey you just subscribed this is why we haven't talked to you about the new product but we are talking about it since weeks already uh if you want to check it out it is here and they access the same page as the other ones okay now let's look at what emails we are sending during the week of the launch so now it's started let's go back to the calendar so we have the teaser the announcement why the how and what the launch and now we have all this at least four emails you can can send way more if you want uh this is a choice but those are the ones I would recommend you to send um the first one would be the fiq email which is a combination of all the questions that people have asked you already about the product another one would be a social proof email so if you have any kind of social proof that can kind of push the um the decision forward uh you can put it in an email those two are basically um meant to remove every purchase barrier that someone has then you have the last day email um you can write another story or um make it a little bit fun and create some scarcity it's like in on Sunday morning uh you just say hey that's the the last day you can buy the product um make some joke I will show you I I made some joke at this one uh and just remind them that you you might send them another email later on but this is the last day and finally you have probably like in the the beginning of the evening the last day just remember them very shortly you thanks them for their attention um tell them that you are going you're not going to send that many email all the time the launch is over uh you're really happy that uh they participated but then um there is only like four hours to buy uh left uh if we look at these emails the one I told you about so you have the FAQ here which is basically same thing very clear and structural fq I just explained that I took all the questions that people were asking and then I put them together uh again with a nice tone and some pictures easy to read easy to digest uh the story I kind of um mix them up here the story I s on the Friday uh evening so before the weekend starts um I put a little um video here and then come up with some uh some sort of nice story that make them connect again with the founder make them connect with the brand that is not really like pushing sales but more like just create connection again then uh on Sunday morning the one I told you about um yeah unfortunately if you're not French you probably don't get it uh the the umor here but it start by something like hey at this stage you probably can't bother receiving emails from us anymore um yeah that's not uh that's WR that's not false uh and then it goes um again and say yeah here the the joke was kind of no I'm not going to tell you how good is the blue jein I'm not going to tell you all the the characteristic that are amazing and and tho regulation and blah blah blah no no I'm not going to tell you I'm going to let the previous customer tell you and then goes the uh the social proof from the previous launch a bit more image if you see that is because there were gifts I love to use gifts um in emails they are quite hard to use actually because you need to make it right uh so they're not too heavy and they're loading with the email but when I can I love to to it it takes less room and and people can can see a lot of pictures like that and I bring them to the page again finally the last one nothing to say more from what I said already it's just thank them all and and tell them that there is only four wordss left okay if we go back to our time frame here uh I didn't talk about this part as well as this part usually so the the product launch method I'm showing you uh is issued from uh the product launch formula from Jeff Walker um that is a book that you should read if you're planning to uh to launch a product soon um but this is not exactly the same I kind of along the years I kind of changed the the method change the content of the emails uh the this book is way more oriented to high ticket product like coaching programs masterminds and and so on while the product launch method I'm showing you is more for any kind of product basically it's a simpler framework um that can work for everything uh in this method it is um quite similar and you can have a look I put it I put here uh the list of the emails uh he recommends to send in the book you can Inspire yourself and kind of create a mix of what I'm showing menu and what there is here it doesn't matter as long as you make it nice for people and they enjoy to read it but one thing that he recommends um and I agree with but it creates a little bit more complexity is that you use video uh it means that basically every single email instead of doing as I did uh putting all the content in the email you try to send people to watch a video where you give a lot of value and while you are doing that you are also using ads to bring people back if they haven't seen it to this video so the same principle uh of connection and understanding the product and everything could be displayed uh given through a video instead of an email the example of the launch here basically it is like that we haven't done any videos uh just one but it was accessory uh it means that you don't have to make it complex if you want you can create them otherwise just having the content in the email sometimes that's my belief it's easier because people are already in the email there if you grab their attention using the methods I'm going to talk to you about right after if you grab their attention you Captivate them with the story you make you make it fun engaging for me you don't need to bring them somewhere else you can give everything in each email and in the end to sell you don't need more than that but if you are good with videos and your product deserves it U then just go for it and if you do that you can also kind of um ask them to share the video and and give an opportunity to new people seeing the video that are not in the list yet to sign up for the day of launch so you can also gather some more people in your launch while you're are launching it's not crazy but it it works um yeah and for the rest of the structure I've mentioned it already um you have you can have basically every email sent to a video and every email from the week of launch that send directly that leads directly to the product page saves page call it when however you want okay um now that I have talked about those two part and that you start having global vision of what is the launch what are the different parts uh let's talk about the quiz Discovery funnel this is a method that I'm explaining on my channel I have several videos about it that I'm going to show you now which is using here a product launch it means that this part here is everything you need before the product launch mostly and a little bit after but basically when you just have a business idea how you can test it make sure it's valuable and there is a chance to make it and generate insights improve the offer uh improve the messaging scale away waiting list using ads mostly and then use the product launch method I just told you about to the list that you have created using this method and this video here that you can just click on it when once you have the figma file or find on my channel is the video that explains the complete process of the the quiz Discovery disc correct qu Fel and you have different videos which are here for market research the two of them here it's a video that allows you that shows you how to create uh ads extremely fast using AI um you can create your whole campaign in less than an hour I have the same kind of video to create a ling page uh you can create your landing page from just an idea to a live landing page in less than an hour same thing here it's how to create a quiz because as you guessed uh it includes a quiz to gather data and finally improve the offer I have a video about analyzing Facebook ads there is probably way more to tell but at least I have one here I already have a video about product launch that I've done a while ago that you can also watch if you like but this is not uh after this one is not the most necessary part okay so this is just to tell you the product launch is variable for both people starting a business especially I would say um but it is also um valuable for businesses that want to start something new to launch a new product to their existing audience all right and now let's talk about the general rules to write emails they are not in specific order but they are not all extremely important so I'm going just to go through each of them and kind of commands I will try not to make it too long as I usually do um the first part is the tone be nice is at least I I I like to be nice to feel warm uh and I think people really like that it depend of your product uh your branding the if you the only thing is if you start something I would always go for something for for brand that has a voice that is warm and nice rather than serious and sometimes we think that some product should be Sal but it's not true it is always easy to be nice with people and and to smile and to use smilees for example from time to time just to make them see that you are smiling when you talk at them when you speak at them uh don't oversell so that's combined with be nice as I mentioned before if you tell stories if you explain the value of your product if you um if you connect with people you don't have to oversell you can create scarcity without being too pushy you can show the benefits without making it uh without pushing on their problem and make them feel bad uh I always love to just like not hide that I'm selling something but just not make it too much in general right for one single person this one is extremely important and I think this is a a beginner mistake in email marketing uh a lot of people when they write an email they think they're write to a list you don't want to do that you write to one single person generally I would take for an example I I kind of like is if you have a warm tone uh you can think of um um old on uh sorry for the accent um old aunt or or uncle that you are writing to you know are close enough so you are you're friendly with them but they are also like not your your cousin or your friend so you cannot be too close to them uh you know you can kind of picture someone like that or picture one of your customers if you know who they are but you just write for this person you don't write for a list you address them talking to them not to talking to several people they need to feel that it is something that was written for them not that there are someone in the middle of a massive broadcast communication okay now the format the sender is a person that is also depending of your branding but in any case it's always better when the founder is sending the email and to sign the email as a person if it's not the founder it can be someone team or whoever it is but not to send the email as a brand but as a person make it look like an email from friend this is something I mentioned just before and you want to create uh this kind of mix between wellmade but also not too much not too well made uh it's okay to have like that if it's not perfect uh but you you don't want to I like to write as if it would be first um an email I would write to a friend but then I add some formatting to make it easy to write to read sorry so it do it doesn't feel uh overselling when it's kind of this mix use a ba basic uh easy to read font arel for example uh you don't want to be too funcy on the font just needs to be easy to read use formatting is just what I mentioned uh just think that people are always scanning things um you want to make them look forward to the next step so when they are writing reading here they are captivated by your intro if you have done it correctly um they have the menu um I will talk talk to you about the menu just later on and then they have a little bit of attention and they see okay there is a picture coming out so they they keep until here and sometimes you don't have pictures but then you have the formatting that show that there is something else coming up that is important to read so what you want is do everything use every weapon you have to keep the reader's attention because your goal here is not to make people open the email is you want them to read your email until the end every single email this is how you can sell in the end okay it's talking a lot I hope it won't be too long this video uh anyway um where was I um make it look like use a basic front use formatting okay tell stories I think I told you a lot about it already create curiosity Loops let's talk about that what are curiosity Loops every single step is a validation when you read an email the first one comes from the title if you have a wrong title a boring title no one will read the email even though you have the best email no one will see it so the first curiosity Gap is the title it needs to pop out it needs to create curiosity to make people intrigued um they want to to kind of create question that the only way to find out the answer is to actually open the email but it needs to be related to the content of the email which means here it's seed of to 2023 is coming what are you talking about I know what's the seed I ionize that but what are you talking about so I want to open it but then it makes sense because I'm talking about the seed right okay so that's the first curiosity Loop that arrives here and then I want to continue doing that by recreating this kind of curiosity Gap to make them want to read the complete email and I say I imagine you have already heard about seasonal fruits and vegetables but have you heard about seasonal jeans now you are kind of I mean for people that are interested in maybe not everybody but now you are you are hyped okay I want to know about this n gin and then you read the story here I segmented it and here I pitch next I kind of create a new city uh loop that will bring to my next email but usually and I'm going um to show you that here usually you want to create to the loop everywhere you always need to think about it it's very hard to do um but this is what you should a aim for this is another email so we have the link with the previous email short announcement same thing as here you want to grab people's attention then here because the email is a lot longer I have what I call a menu I kind of basically say what they will find in the email and trying to make it already appealing so they want to find out about every single part of the email and I say for example and Bon new a little video uh video short after a big day at the the workshop it doesn't sound amazing in English but whatever uh they want to to do to know that like what was it so now I've created a curiosity Loop that can bring them from here to here but I also want and if you can do that that's amazing I want to create a curiosity Loop that go from here to here I want to kind of make it um uh not really ending each paragraph because I want for people to want to read the next paragraph all the time remember the ultimate goal is that people read your entire email okay and I've talk about the Curiosity Loops uh now use pi pictures givs uh and segment the text it's what I told you before when you look at your email it needs to be filled with interesting things you don't want to have like long blocks of text you want it to be easy to read this is why you use gifts you use pictures you use videos you use formatting uh highlights whatever you can use so you kind of create this uh this flow of new things coming to the screen and you keep the readers attention what's mandatory make it extremely clear to unsubscribe and always explain Next Step the first one extremely clear to unsubscribe and there is a little trick here with product launch um but as a general rule I love to have it like Crystal Clear like almost create a button if you want to unsubscribe just go and click because we don't want to send you emails that you don't want to read so that's respect for the customer but also it create trust it shows them that okay if I if I don't click it's my choice so then I want to read the emails now and then uh the second thing is always explain next steps I think I told you about it already when um here I pitch the next email and here I will pitch the next email too and so on and so forth okay now we have two chapter left uh we have seen the example of the launch I showed you uh we have seen the kind of time frame and the different emails that we want to uh to send we have SE seen the difference between launching a new product or a new business uh and then we just have seen the general rules to make people want to read your emails just by the way here when you do it right uh people really remember your your email uh I just can tell you that people from this brand they are actually looking for new emails we are not sending them too often but when they see it they are happy to read it because they always smile they always have a good time anyway I said I'm stopping on this one uh so we have the two other chapters let's talk about tools and then I'm going to show you the prompt the tools first you can use whatever tool you want but email marketing is becoming harder and harder espe especially with a deliverability tracking and this is why uh you need to find a good compromise between the good tool but also not too expensive if you cannot afford it um the rollsroyce is a active campaign definitely if you can afford it go for active campaign it's an amazing tool you can do whatever you want uh it's for me it's the it's the best tool for email marketing um I used clavio um which makes me realize that I didn't even show you the the numbers here but um this is Clay it doesn't matter really uh here you can go and see the the different emails that I've sent those are exactly the ones uh you can see here um but look for example here very interesting example I used clavio and here we got the two launch emails and I realized that for some reason um I think some like a fair amount of people from the list haven't received received the launch email it was bounced meaning the email was uh rejected by their inbox even though I make things right and even though clavio is good email marketing tool so I re launched a launch email recent launch email um make it I changed some wording I made I made sure that I'm not using a wording that could be could trigger spam filters and so on but still you know this is a real legit brand that's sending emails since a long time and we use clay VI and still uh we can have deliverability problem so if you go for a tool that is not well known uh that is not known for having a good deliverability rate then beware that you might uh you might actually lose money because uh it's not only about the deliverability rate it's how many people can see your email and how many people can you sell to so sometimes paying a little bit more in a tool uh is really worth it because you get the money back because you just sell more in the end um here is the one I just started using for my own personal brand because I found out it's kind of a mix this one is specific for e-commerce um and those two are extremely expensive uh and M light is kind of is high performance but it's quite cheap but also it doesn't uh Lo to do the same uh sop sophistication settings that you can do in both of them uh in both these tools you can really go deep on who is uh is receiving an email and who is not uh you can do it in mail or light but not at the same level unfortunately but at least it's a good derivability rate and it's easy to use so yeah if you're on a budget I would I would rather go for this one if you're in e-commerce go for this one but if you're not in in e-commerce and on a budget go for M or right okay now we are going to actually write emails and for that we are going to use the prompt I have created what is there in this prompt everything you have I have explained here is in the promt me meaning I give the context uh it's an email sequence to launch a new product to an existing audience via email the role skilled marketers copywriters specializ in crafting engaging persuasive email sequence for product launch blah blah blah your mission is to guide me through the process of writing an effective email sequence you will help me identify the key benefits product launch sequence here I have all the emails that are explained with their goal so already when you use this prompt the AI will understand what kind of email you want to write you can obviously not write them all at once it will be a long process of uh going back and forth engaging with the AI uh to write every single email but at least U it knows what you are talking about at the very beginning writing rules for emails so those are the ones I told you about if you want to add your own style which could be different then you can simply modify the prompts before using it to add your writing styles um and I just realized I put it twice here so I just need to remove one let let me just pause okay so I removed the duplicated parts and finally the last part is your tasks and that is important to understand uh you start with this prompt and the task is ask me about the product the target agents and which email I would like to start with once I provide you with the necessary information generate five unique concept for the email I want to write keeping in mind the product launch sequence and wrri writing rules that means that first you put the prompt I'm going to show that right now let's copy it so I'm in chat gpg now you can do it with whatever I as I mentioned just insert the prompt and now it asks me about your product what's the name what's the main features it wants to understand the product if you have a very clear definition of your product every single information about your C customers about everything you have this is the moment to give the AI this information if you want to uh quickly uh very quickly create um this kind of document with all the information about your product I really suggest you watch this video specifically this one too because I have this similar kind of prompt which helps you to create a market research extremely fast using uh YouTube and Reddit um as well as scrapping kind of websites to to generate a product description analyze an audience and have this huge brief that you can give the the the AI at this point but just to show you that we don't need complete uh brief I just took an example I'm going to enter which is the previous um business example I used it's a AI um dog trainer assistant so it's a very very short description of the product and of the Target audence and here if I go back to CH gpg I just PST it here and I say I want to write the email too so normally it knows what image it is about and it should give me five steps five Concepts yeah it does so now if you remember let's give it some time and going back here the second email is announcement and why it's all about telling a story you have it here that's the same and you see story story a bit of social proof here it's it's all about your creativity your product and how you can come up with a concept that will nail it and make people connect to your product and to you as a Founder but because uh chpt doesn't know it then at least he goes with some example so let's have a look at them the journey to Harmony um share a relatable story about the founder experience with a reactive dog and the frustration that came with it yep a patient for positive change describe the paent for dog and the vision well bit boring transforming lives one dog at the time uh begin with a powerful anecdote about a dog an owner who lives we transformed by P no that's not what we want we want why is the founder why you as a Founder you you created the the product sh relable story about the challenge of training a reactive dog and the frustration with existing method it sounds pretty good um go for the concept four I didn't write anything about titles but generally they're not that crazy I like to make them a lot shorter so this something you can uh change after okay and now you have a first story obviously it's definitely not the perfect email but at least now you can say Okay um sounds good but please make it longer and uh um let me think a little bit okay I was just reading the beginning it's actually not too bad unfortunately it's a story that um jpt made up so it's not your story uh so you can say something like make it longer and um create a better transition to introduce the product as well as um including my own story rather than the one you made up and here you can tell your story um obviously I'm not going to do it but then you will have another uh result that you can um command give feedback um rewrite yourself what I really like to do is for example I'm doing I'm using blocks all the time like text text blocks and I would for example just take this pass it here I don't know why I like to read write on this one and then I would rewrite it um but I wouldn't make the the sentences perfect I would just add some part here some B there change um and then I'm like okay I recopy my thing I put it here I say here is my current version up up please make it nicer and um add more emotion whatever you know but you write so you start the prompt it gives you something you T it somewhere else you rewrite then you put it back you ask a few improvements but obviously it doesn't give you like the the thing you want so you do it again you take it outside you rewrite give it back as some improvement and so on and so forth until the point that you can actually you go into your email tool whatever it is and insert it then comes the moment that you look at your email and you think okay do I have everything do I have the Curiosity Loops um where can I introduce uh where can I use pictures where can I use videos gifs uh and when um can I use formatting to make it easy to read it's a long process actually writing an like that is like writing a landing page uh it's a very long process and doing a launch requires you to do it several time so that's not an easy thing to do but once you do it well then it's a very cool thing and and it works actually all right I think that's it for this video uh we went through the whole process don't hesitate if you have any questions um as I mentioned it's a very long process so there are probably things I didn't talk about I don't this dat go in the comments and ask them uh also if you have enjoyed the video if you have found any value please like it uh it will help me a lot actually um if you haven't subscribed you can subscribe to the channel so you won't miss the next one and uh again in the comment feel free tell me what you liked and what I could improve as well as potential some other video ideas I can do uh to help you uh I really suggest if you're in the process of launching a business and you haven't seen the video about the discovery qu funel I am putting on the screen right now the video that explains this complete concept um so yeah if you want to watch it then I join you in a few second and otherwise I say bye-bye see you in the next video
