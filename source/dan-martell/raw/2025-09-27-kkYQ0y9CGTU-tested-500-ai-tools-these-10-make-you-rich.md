# Tested 500 AI Tools These 10 Make You Rich

Published: 2025-09-27

I've tried more than 500 AI tools and these are the ones that will actually help you get rich. I own dozens of AI companies and I can tell you in the AI era, you won't get rich by working harder. You'll get rich by mastering the tools that help you work less. This isn't just another chat GPT tutorial that you've seen a thousand times. These AI tools are what I'm implementing right now in all my companies to be more productive and stay ahead of the competition. So, let's get into it. Tool number one, your.com. Your Atlas helps you close deals while you sleep. It's an AI voice agent that specializes in bringing opportunities into your world so that you don't have to be on the phone. We use it in all of my companies when people fill out any kind of form so that we can call them right away and ask them questions to help get them qualified and on the phone with the right person. I mean, I even use it to confirm all the kids who register for my free youth program, Kings Club, so that it calls them and gets them to verbally commit to showing up because if you've never tried to get a bunch of kids in a room, sometimes they don't follow through on what they sign up for. It saved my team dozens of hours of calling all these people to have the conversation, answering the same questions because your atlas did it for us. So, if you want to get rich, speed to lead is everything in business. So, here's how it works. Just go to youratlas.com. I put my name and my cell number and I say talk to AI. Now it's going to call me. >> Emma from Atlas. Am I speaking with Dan? >> Yeah, this is Dan. Hey Emma, I got a quick question cuz I'm in a rush. I'm shooting a video. Do you guys uh help if I have like Facebook ads and stuff and I want to like get my ads to get a faster response? >> Absolutely. And Atlas is designed to help businesses like yours by ensuring faster follow-ups and optimizing ad spend, which can significantly improve your response times and overall ad performance. Would you like to schedule a call with our founder to see exactly how Atlas can work for your Facebook ads? >> Yeah, let's do that. How about uh 2 p.m. next Friday? >> Great news, Dan. We have an available slot at 2 p.m. next Friday. Let's get that booked for you. Can I confirm your name is Dan Martell and your email? >> No, let's Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't put my email on the internet. No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop it. Stop it. That's Emma. Okay, Emma's your Atlas.com. You can have it, Bob. You can have it whoever you want. I showed Atlas to my father-in-law the other night and it broke his brain. He kept asking me, he's like, "Well, who's Emma?" And I was like, "Well, Emma's not real. What do you mean?" I go, "Well, Emma's the AI." The person I was talking to, that call, that's the AI. Cuz he only ever knew chat. He didn't know that it could call and talk and have conversation. Think about it. removing yourself from calling people, answering inbound calls, answering questions that you answer all the time. Route them to the right person, programming it so it can be a world-class salesperson on your behalf will save you all the time in the world. Now, that's just the first tool, but we've got nine more money-making tools that we got to get through. Tool number two, natn.io. What it is is an open-source workflow automation to automate all your business workflows with AI built into it. All you have to do is drag and drop or code your logic into the automation. So every time something happens over here, it runs through the automation and you get an output over there. If you want to get rich, automation is the best way to buy back your time so you can focus on higher leverage things that make you more money. For an example, every company should automate their onboarding. You could have a payment link that kicks off an email that then invites them to your internal community and then sends them a text message that invites them to schedule a call with a person in your company and have the whole thing automated. So once somebody buys, everything just runs on its own. Build it once and watch your clients get onboarded automagically. We use it in every part of our businesses. My department leads are asked to automate every repeated function in their department so that we only work on things that add real value, not that feel like monotonous tasks. Now that we've got automation covered, it's time to build real leverage. Before I share the third tool, I just want to make it clear if you want to try out any of these tools yourself, I have them all linked below in the description. However, if you're building real AI innovation right now, like actually coding cool new software, and you want to partner with me and my team at Martell Ventures, click the first link in the description and apply, and we'll see if it's a fit. Tool number three, lovable.dev. What it is is an app builder where all you do is describe the product you want to have built, the functionality, how it works, and it will actually create it for you. It can build an app, it can build a website, it can build anything. This has never happened before. Ready to deployed apps in minutes. You know, most people had to wait for a developer to build them something. Now you can just go to lovable and type in whatever you want and it'll build it for you. There's just so much opportunity. The limiting factor is your creativity on what you can get the app to build. Most people just don't trust it. They're like, "There's no way this can actually build something useful." Just like when people started playing with spreadsheets, they're like, "There's no way the spreadsheet could actually do my personal finances." It's like, "No, it can." Is it really that powerful? Oh, it's that powerful. Can you really build apps that people pay for? Oh, every day. I mean, the company just raised hundreds of millions of dollars because they have so many people dependent on its platform. If you want to get rich this year, you need to be able to build as fast as your competition or better. And they're using these tools. So, I just want to walk you through a simple example to give you a sense of how powerful this is. So, you would just start a new project. You type landing page for my AI automation agency that helps plumbers in the Midwest. Right? Very simple, very specific. Enter. Review what it created. Review the website. Review the copy. Review the flows. It has all the information from the whole internet and it brought it together and it created a website for you with a paragraph, three sentences. It's wild. It creates a sharable link that you can send to your team members or your business partner to preview it. And you can even test payments and take payments on the website all in the matter of seconds. I was using it today. We have a new coaching program I just launched for people that are like seven figures or higher called Quantum. And I wanted everybody to fill out an intake form so I could really understand their business. And what I did is I took all the data they gave me in that form and then fed it to Lovable and asked it to create a one-page design that allows me to understand their situation, their challenges, their business metrics, everything in one page. and it created a slide deck so that I can go through it. So while I'm coaching them, I pull up the information they gave me. That way, every tactic or strategy I give them is personalized for them. Being able to automate that and visualize that at scale would require a full-time person. If you really want to take your business to the next level, you have to use tools to build apps because apps are the new spreadsheet. Building automation, workflow, new innovation, that's what's going to separate you from your competition. So, now that you've got the products built, or at least a way to build them, it's time to make some real money. Tool number four, get revio.com. In short, Revo turns direct messages on Instagram and LinkedIn and email and text messages into dollars. It helps you score leads that come in over chat. It suggests the next thing you should share with them as an AI sales co-pilot. It even helps you book calls or take payment through chat. It's a sales assistant on top of your chats on social media. Prior to a tool like this, you had to use spreadsheets and you had all these people involved and who's tracking what and you're using links and it was confusing. With AI built in on top of your chats using Revio, it does lead scoring. It tells you how well the saleserson's doing in regards to following a sales framework and it gives the exact language the person should use to move the sale forward. I personally love to chat in the DMs. I have millions of followers and I love to talk with them. I have to use a tool like Revio so that I can manage my followup. I can see who's serious. It does lead scoring. It gives summaries of everything we've shared so far. So if I come back in, haven't talked to somebody for months, I have all the context. I've got clients making a million dollars a month chatting with strangers on Instagram using Revio. Here's why this works. Your audience, they live in the chat. You got to meet them there so you can close them faster. So this is how simple Revio is. You just connect your social account. You launch a simple campaign to open up the followers and then you reply to them using the suggestions and the guides that Revio gives you so that you can move the conversation forward to book a sales call. It makes it so easy to connect with literally thousands of people and not feel overwhelmed because it prioritizes and it creates your areas of focus in these buckets so that you know who to reply to first. Using AI to help you augment your sales capacity, especially over chats, is next level. But now that your leads are warm, we have to get even higher quality intros on demand. Tool number five, Social Sweep.ai. I'm so excited to share these with you. Social sweep is an internal tool that I've been using for months to help me network as I travel. If you've seen me get on my jet and fly around to different cities and do podcasts and keynotes and dinners and workouts, I've been using Social Suite behind the scenes. It allows me to find the most valuable and important contacts in my network that I didn't even know I had. This tool will change the way you communicate, network, and ask for intros. So, one of my clients had five dream podcasts he wanted to get on. I told him to just load your social contacts into Social Sweep and then tell it who you wanted to connect with and then it showed him the warmest path to get those intros. He was able to get multiple intros and get on three podcasts within weeks. If you want to get rich this year, your connections, your relationships matter more than anything. The way I think about it is very simple. The more hands you shake, the more money you make. You know how you hear people say you're like one relationship away from achieving your goal? Social Sweep will tell you who that one relationship is because it can analyze all your followers. You might have a billionaire following you right now and you don't even know. You might have the cousin of the person whose business you want to buy following you right now and you don't even know. You might want to speak at an event and the person who runs that event is following you on LinkedIn, but again, you don't even know. When you use Social Sweep, it analyzes not only your network, it analyzes the people you're trying to connect with and figure out where is that common ground. It'll even give you the message for what to say to them to get the intro. It's really simple. You just connect your Instagram or LinkedIn. You can ask it who can intro me to target person. It then gives you the message to use to ask for the intro and then you can send it to all those mutual connections. This is such a cheat code to activate your network. Your network is your net worth. And as you travel, organizing meetups, inviting people to work out, maybe stopping by somebody's office that happens to be in the city that you didn't even know live there because who could keep track of it all is how AI is transforming relationships. So, now that you've connected and got your money flowing in, it's time to keep your eyes on it. Tool number six, HelloFrank.ai. HelloFrank is essentially a finance co-pilot. The coolest part is they can spot waste and even give you clear guidance on what decisions you should make based on your numbers. We use it in all my companies within Martell Ventures to just flag things like unused tools or people that have weak financial forecasting or getting a daily cash position in all the companies based on the accounts. Essentially, it allowed me to cut, burn, move my budgets to new tools that actually push the business forward and increase our productivity overnight. See, every dollar saved hits the bottom line. You want to make more profit, cut your expenses, but how can you even see the waste if you have hundreds of transactions? I believe margin is like the oxygen for business. And if you protect it, you can scale. So, here's how it works. You input all your financial statements, literally just connect all the systems. It keeps all of that financial data private. So, it doesn't actually load it into the AI models. And then you can just ask it a simple question like where am I wasting cash? It can look at every one of your reports and then give you the answer so that you can take action. Using AI in your financial world for anomaly detection and fraud protection and daily cash position is kind of a no-brainer. Anybody that doesn't use AI in a tool like this in their financials is just working way harder than they have to. And one of the features they haven't built yet, but I know it's coming is the ability to actually automate the outbound calls for receivables. I know, but you know, Atlas at the beginning that just shows you that voice AI is going to show up in all areas of business to make you even more productive. So now that we plugged the financial leaks in your bucket, it's time to take a look at your strategy. Tool number seven, Alysio.ai. Essentially, Alysio is your go-to market command center. So in the area of business, there's a thing called sales and marketing and customer success, essentially your revenue. And you use Alysio to ask it anything about your revenue and get answers instantly. Think of it like a CRO or a chief revenue officer on steroids. I had one of my clients use it and it analyzed his CRM to find out that 70% of his clients were actually based in Texas. So then it told him to shut down all of his ads that weren't focused on the state of Texas and he went all in. That tripled his performance of his ads, essentially doubling his profits in only a few weeks. You can't fix what you can't see. If you want to get rich, you need to see your numbers. It's really simple. All you have to do is connect your CRM, either like go high level or HubSpot. then your ads account and then your support tools so it can kind of connect the whole thing and then ask it questions like where am I getting my best clients from? Double down on what's working in your data and you will grow your business. So having AI be like this revenue co-pilot to help you increase your sales is awesome, but now it's time to stop payments from slipping through. Tool number eight, flex pay.io. This may only be relevant to people that have a lot of transactions and they care about this problem. But the truth is is 13% of credit card transactions decline, not because a credit card isn't good anymore, but just because the merchant or the person who issued the credit card doesn't have enough information to have it go. So that's what Flex Pay does. Flex Pay recovers failed payments with smart, gentle retries. Essentially, it saves you revenue without annoying your customers because blasting them emails like, "Udate your credit card." They're like, "There's nothing wrong with my credit card. I called my bank. It's not broken. And you're telling me I got to update my credit card and the transaction didn't happen." And they're like, "My credit card's good. You said the transaction didn't happen. Now your team's calling me. It's not a great customer experience." And you don't have to do that. AI will do it for you. I have a company and we have thousands of customers. And we turned it on and I watched our loss MR come back quietly and our support team wasn't even needed. See, keeping a customer is way cheaper than buying a new one. You want to annoy them, bug them with something that's not broken. The way it works is actually really simple. First, just run a recovery calculator to see if how much it could save you makes sense for you. If it does, then you just connect your billing tool and then essentially your gateway sandbox, which is like your test environment, so that it can run examples to see if it'll work. And that's it. Flex Pay will run for you behind the scenes and you don't have to do anything more, making you more money every month without losing those transactions. Having a tool like Flex Pay is invaluable. Now that cash flow is smooth, it's time to hire fast without drowning in interviews. Tool number nine, Hero Hire.ai. Hero is essentially AI HR when it comes to recruiting. It's crazy cool. If you don't have a dedicated recruiter on your team, you need a tool like Hero. Essentially, it runs structured screens, records answers, and hands you ranked short lists of candidates you can pick from. hero does the job that a person would have to do in regards to like screening through hundreds of job applicants. Talking to them, filtering. It's so wild that even in today's world that people still do that role. I believe that AI is going to disrupt the middleman and recruiting is one of those places because I just want to find the match for my business and that person and the hero platform does that. Then my calendar is only interviews with final candidates that actually map to our culture, to the skill set, to the desire of them wanting to work for us. We used to sift through hundreds of resumes. Now with Hero Hire, when people apply, the whole thing is automated through AI. The time to hire from like job description to hiring got reduced to 30 days. If you're looking to hire an executive assistant, it's even crazier because what they did is they went out and curated a community of people using their AI and automation to verify and validate the talent so that if you're looking to hire, you might be able to actually hire somebody in 5 to 7 days. The way I think about it, Hero helps me recruit the people that I train. And when I build the people, the people run the business. Here's how Hero works. You essentially launch a campaign in a couple clicks. job posts, the applications, first interviews, the PI assessment. It does all that for you. It then reviews all the candidates and gives you the top five for every role you might have open. You can get somebody hired and onboarded and it takes you seconds. So, now that we got people and your team is set, now we have to optimize for your business metrics. Tool number 10, precision.co. Precision is AI that's your always on data team. Now, that might sound like an advanced concept, but for you to grow, you need the right information to make decision. So, it builds scorecards. It'll flag weird metrics, and it'll tell you what to do next to work with your team, through your team, to get change done in your business. So, what's cool is all my teams at 8 a.m., they get one email with all the different KPIs and one clear action they have to move forward to improve the business. In business, no scoreboard, no game. There's no way for you to be able to grow if you can't make decisions from real numbers if you want to get rich this year. The way it works, super simple. You connect your CRM solution, your billing system, and any kind of Facebook ads, and then you pick the weekly CEO scorecard that you want to see. It'll turn on anomaly alerts and use Slack to deliver any messages for you. Essentially, it monitors the data. It gives you a scorecard that everybody has to follow against and it'll give you the action items your team needs to do to move it forward so that on your weekly meetings, you know exactly what to talk to them about. It takes the guesswork out of actually operating and running a business. Again, I've tried over 500 plus AI tools, and these are the ones I use in all my businesses. All I want is for you to pick one tool and use it this week. Remember, all the links are below in the description. Just click one, sign up for it, try it out. Momentum is earned. And when you start making better decisions using AI, and you start stacking wins, you'll watch the needle move. That is how you build the business.
