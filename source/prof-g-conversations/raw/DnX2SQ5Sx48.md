spent years building tunnels underneath the Texas Mexican border we come in and this might be fair or unfair but on a per capita bases kill about 30,000 Americans and then take 5,000 back and hide them in tunnels under Mexico and the question I was asked is what would we do and I believe our response would make Israel's response look gentle is that [Music] fair I I don't think it is entirely Fair I'm just thinking about the wars that I've [Music] watched David where does this podcast find you uh I am in my home in Northwest Washington this is the place where I write many of my columns and all of my fiction so let's bust right into it your new book Phantom orbit is a thriller about an invisible enemy that could disrupt a satellite signal Central to our daily lives so let's start there give us an overview of what this novel is trying to tell us or what it what it illuminates about the current state of play in technology and geopolitics so this is a novel about the way in which space weapons Space Warfare are coming to dominate uh Warfare more broadly I've become convinced in four visits to Ukraine that Ukraine is really the first space War I can explain that in a minute but the book opens with a a Russian Astro physicist not a a Defector not a Trader but somebody who's come to believe that Russia and China developed the ability to um essentially have a kill switch that can disable the GPS system on which uh American Communications every one of our cell phone calls or air travel or travel of every sort Depend and uh he tries to communicate that to the United States thinking as a responsibility to do so uh and the CIA doesn't want to respond doesn't get back to him and through the book one of the Mysteries is why the CIA isn't dealing with this warning that he's making but more broadly it's a book about about what I think is the future of of warfare um maybe the future of Commerce as well which is systems and space so I immedately go to there's one person who doesn't report to any government who doesn't work for the government I would argue hasn't shown a lot a great deal of fidelity to any specific Commonwealth who I believe owns and controls 51% of the satellites in orbit do you see that as a risk so I assume you're talking about Elon Musk and correct let's just talk for a minute about musk um I do think there's a risk there but I also I want to underline why he and the systems he runs are so important so as you say starlink today has roughly 5,000 satellites in low or arobic they're able to provide broadband internet coverage for pretty much the whole world specifically they're able to provide broadband internet coverage for the Ukrainian military in its forward positions without which I don't think they could operate so he he and his system are crucial for Ukraine survival he could decide tomorrow that he's sick of this forever war in Ukraine he wants to sell Teslas make Teslas in China and pull out there are some limits on his ability to do that because he has a contract with the Pentagon but as the United States grows more and more dependent on our Tech ecosystem to provide um lowcost satellite launch incredibly interesting new systems that do what our spy agencies could once do only now for everybody those private sector business people have much more leverage over our national security policy and I do worry what happens if one day they change their minds we're putting a lot of of eggs in their basket so talk a little bit about the underlying technology phones and I mean there's there's some technologies that have just Advanced incredibly you know at a rapid Pace others not so rapid describ the technology around satellites and has the Cadence of innovation there matched uh underwhelmed superseded advances and other types of technology and what does that mean practically why are why are The Satellites now what are they capable of that they weren't capable of say 10 or 20 years ago so I I think the most important uh aspect of this is the way in which costs have lowered because of competition because of our entrepreneurial ecosystem so just briefly reviewing in our minds the history of of space uh I grew up in a world where Russia when I was 7 years old launched the first satellite and then had the first cosmonaut in space we were behind United States had an incredible catch-up effort we put a men on the moon nobody has equal that to this day there was the ER of the Space Shuttle we were totally dominant but then for some reason the United States lost interest in space uh and to the point that we had to buy launch capability for satellites from other countries we just didn't have the the Rockets to put big satellites in orbit Russia supplied that for a time and then Along Came commercial space Along Came Elon Musk and with SpaceX uh the history of trying and trying and trying and finally getting it right he has extraordinary low cost launch capability and that's been matched by by others in the industry so the things you can do in space cheaply um much broader ARR the uh communication satellites that are beaming broadband internet down to earth I don't think we're imagined 10 15 years ago 5,000 satellites is a lot Amazon's about to put 2,000 at least of its own in space to do its its business there are other companies around the world that are jumping into this as well so um the cost Advantage is is significant all the stuff is in low earth orbit it's very vulnerable the Russians have just uh our intelligence Community says been thinking about the mismatch between all that we have and the little that they have and saying if we needed to take out those low low earth orbit satellites we could use a nuclear weapon we just create a debris field in low earth orbit so nothing could pass you know really for a generation so that's the the the vulnerability but on the the basic question you're asking GPS was a brilliant idea that was developed initially for national security purposes and just got better and more refined year by year Russia tried to copy it from the beginning it was very very poor um had nothing like the resolution Fidelity that the US had china has a system called beu that they've been working on very hard um it's pretty good but it's not as good as GPS um Europe has its own own system India has a system Japan has a system everybody knows this is the backbone of everything that you do um but it's vulnerable it's vulnerable to attack it's vulnerable to spoofing other Mischief that that can be done to to interfere with the salad so I think one thing I want to do in this book is get people thinking about the technologies that are part of everyday life I mean who doesn't go a moment without a cell phone but without GP GPS to to locate where that phone is and allow it to to to work and exchange signals the the system wouldn't would would be would be untenable wouldn't work so a couple thoughts listen you talk about this one they're vulnerable but s civilian populations isn't it isn't part of this process to communicate to adversaries that an attack on our satellites would be like an attack on a civilian population that would be an act of war or do you think it's more realistic to develop technologies that make these things stealthy and more difficult to take out so um I think our vulnerability is greater because our dependence on these systems is is greater uh it's asymmetric in that sense that's why Russia thinks if we obliterated everything in low earth orbit we'd suffer but the Americans the West would suffer more so that's that's why the balance of Terror prevails in nuclear weapons may not be as as applicable I think hardening satellites I think um developing redundancy I think finding ways to avoid uh vulnerable Communications from satellites to Earth through the kind of thing that starlink as starlink uses mesh networks in space you got 5,000 satellites spinning around they're creating their own internet as they were in space using MH networks up there to exchange signals so that they can download them to Earth at the most appropriate opportune time uh technology like that are really helpful we have now have a space force that's first job is to figure out what's up there what what among the hundreds and hundreds of satellites might have attack capability by by monitoring not just from Earth but closeup to to take a look and they've seen some extraordinary things which I try to describe in the book The um very cleverly configured Chinese seemingly attack satellites Russian satellites that are uh structured like matrushka dolls where a little satellite pops out of a big satellite and then goes toward the target um so then space force will think how do we Harden the system so they're less vulnerable another thing we haven't talked about is the ability to use high powerered microwaves or lasers to beam malware into satellites from a distance without uh people on Earth necessarily being aware that that mware had been implanted that it could be activated in a time of of Crisis so you want to harden satellites against that kind of risk and then finally inevitably the US will want its own offensive capability in space I have no idea what that's going to be this is the the most classified area I've ever encountered as a journalist as a writer to try to penetrate you just you just don't get answers when you ask okay like what what weapons are you developing but I'm sure they're de developing some um I had one of those aha moments in technology I remember the first time I bought something on my BlackBerry or took a picture of a check and it automatically showed up in my checking account I had one of those moments I think about a month or two months ago I I was on a plane and I used starlink and within 2 minutes of connecting to starlink I got a call on my phone and the quality it was FaceTime and the FaceTime call was perfect on a plane I mean it really is powerful it's amazingly good technology yeah it's just it's it's intoxicating and and a few days before I had flown over the uh West Coast or excuse me the east coast of Florida and saw starlink or a SpaceX Brocket flying into space I'm like you just got to give it to this guy I mean he's a he's you know he's not doing a photo sharing app he's putting satellites into space but wouldn't the rest of the world pray for our problems in the sense that our vulnerability and our problems are a function of the fact that we're dominating this final frontier you know we're 25% of global GDP we're you know we have the biggest military in the world but I think we're maybe 40 or 50% of the world's military maybe a little bit more than that but it feels like we just dominate space isn't this an example of how America is Leap progging ahead so this is an example of the continuing the dynamism of the American Technology sector as is the creation of Art language models or most things of Technology were not as far behind as we worried we were um I think my response would be uh in a characteristically American way we end up sharing the technology that we create um with the world and it enhances the world's ability to do the things that we do right the internet was created in the United States for initially for very limited purposes to share defense information among different Labs we ended up sharing that with the world and and encouraging a governance system uh through I can that was um not controlled by government but was controlled by people uh who were technically competent knew not how to protect the system we made it open in in that been sadly to me what Paradox the modern world is that that super open communication system that we created and gave the world ends up empowering closed societies that can control it and adding a degree of instability to open societies that can't control it who could have predicted that but that's the way it turned out but we we continue as as with as with G GPS is a perfect example this was an American idea it was developed initially in secret we share the technology with the whole world everybody's got one everybody's better off for having one uh we don't say boo about it I think the main thing that the US tries to do is get some order and regulation for for space so things don't bump into each other that whole command and control system for space the US runs we're trying to spin off parts of it but again I I think um our problem is we create these fantastic Technologies and then become vulnerable to them look at internet hacking look at the vulnerability of everything we do in the United States to the assaults on the technology that we created what do we do about that we don't stop creating the technology but we do need to think more about how to protect it you said it sort of the the intersection of these technological developments in geopolitics if you were what do you see as the biggest threat maybe it's more than one is it some sort of malware is it a Cyber attack is it uh a war in space is it a AI becoming sentient and super weapons if you were to try and guess what are the most U frightening potential headlines we might read in the next 2 or 3 years and involve technology what what is your best guess so on the purely technological front um I think I do worry about um the speed of warfare as AI systems um increasingly make decisions uh because with hypersonic missiles the the decision time for human beings um isn't isn't there so I'd liken it I'd liken it to the what Deep Mind or Alpha go did to playing chess or go so as I understand an alphago understands every move that any human being ever made on a go board and then can think of any move that could be made that no human being ever thought of same thing with chess uh it's not just it's not it's not just a compendium of every move in the past that was made it's something much more creative than that so apply into Warfare uh A system that with that power could think of strategies vulnerabilities ways to exploit weakness that even the the the most aggressive military planners couldn't think of and and um I know the person who's worried most about this before he died was Henry Kissinger I talked to Kissinger at length Kissinger wrote a couple of books about it that AI present Ed enormous opportunities in way as we all know but from his perspective as somebody who' spent really his whole career thinking about arms control the real threat now wasn't the weapons but the AI systems that would drive use of the weapons and as he died that was the thing top most in his mind and he was right so give us you you cover these conflicts give us your sense or the state of play of Ukraine or the war in Ukraine right now it feels like we've been distracted with a bunch of other things haven't spent that much time thinking about it so just to briefly describe Ukraine as it seemed to me just over a month ago when I was last there um I I visited with President zalinski it's always inspiring in this case it was inspiring and depressing he described a situation he was still then waiting for Congressional approval of the weapons and he said if if we don't get them we have no choice but to Retreat and he drew me a little map of the battlefield and said we have 2,000 rounds a day the Russians have 8,000 just can't hold these lines as he drawn them we have to reduce shrink and we have to take some of our positions out so that was happening I I fear it's happening now if you read the news the Russians are advancing in in the East while I wait for the the weapons to arrive uh what when the ukrainians get the weapons that were sending them I think the wisest course for them is to consolidate their positions to um make sure the Russians don't gain any more territory and prepare for next year offensive operations that could begin to push the Russians back the Russians are in it for the long haul too they just put in place a team in their defense Ministry that that's going to be about a war economy for as far ahead as we can imagine Putin isn't Giving Up So for me the thing sadly that that people need to focus on is giving Ukraine the resources to keep fighting as long as it's going to P pay that cost until it can get to the point where it has the leverage to push the Russians and the Chinese uh toward negotiations for a just negotiated settlement I I Can't Describe what that would look like but there one let me tell you one other thing about about what you see in Ukraine which is interesting I think to your listeners Ukraine has developed an incredible entrepreneurial ecosystem um ukrainians are making their own drones now that can reach far into Russia they they have attacked 200 miles east of Russia in one case I read about recently they've taken out uh roughly 15% of Russia's refining capacity they're building drones because Russia's gotten better at ew electronic warfare that can jam the signals that allow guidance and and and successful targeting by drones they they they're putting AI at the edge in their drones they cheap little drones they make them in furniture stores they just kind of cheap little wood but they fly and then they're putting very sophisticated AI systems that can map the terrain and even if they're cut off from any Communications with satellite guidance or with their home home base can still get to their targets they're doing that on their on their own largely some American entrepreneurs and it's it's the Ukrainian War has become if if you remember from your history the Spanish Civil War the international Brigade in keev now there are entrepreneurs from all over the world I met Australians Portuguese lots of Americans and they're just coming there to help the ukrainians think of ways to survive it's it's it's a fascinating little little world it deserves more more good journalism to describe it so uh you know with with technology their technology is really good and they have stayed ahead of the Russians I think they can stay in the field to come back to my point until they have enough power to negotiate with Russia from a position of strength now talk a little bit about your sense of the war in Gaza and how technology is playing out there so uh Technology's failures in Gaza Israel's technology superpower Israel's technology it appears from New York Times reporting was sufficient that they captured plans for what Hamas would do on October 7 but human failure the the inability of senior Intelligence Officers to take seriously what Junior Intelligence Officers had seen in the collection is part of the tragedy the uh you October 7 Israel just didn't didn't see it coming Israel didn't see the trench system the underground Metro as they call it uh the tunnels I mean it turns out in this tiny area Gau is like 25 miles long and 7 miles wide in that tiny area there are 350 miles of tunnels imagine that you know just crisscrossing at every level Israel didn't really have an adequate sense of that and um I'm right working at column today about Israel beginning to think about an endgame that doesn't obliterate Hamas that may not be possible but begins to develop alternative non- Hamas governance in Gaza which means turning to the people metan who hates were the Palestinian Authority uh and but there are a lot of Israeli especially in the IDF who think that's the only way to go I share that you what how do you think this thing if you were to try and play it out and you've written um about okay what is what what about the day after how how if you had to speculate this plays out and then what does it look like after there's some sort of resolution so I think the first thing is to realize that Rafa in a sense has been overplayed by by both sides Israel does not at present have the nor forces for an all out assault on Rafa this is more noise than it is actual attack plan um every time the US says we don't think you should attack Rafa n seems to think prime minister seems to they G has say I'm going to attack Rafa uh but um there aren't those plans at present and uh people in the IDF agree with people and the US government that um doing this carefully not necessarily in a rush makes sense and they understand more to the point that unless you've thought clearly about how you're going to maintain order once you've cleared Rafa you're not going to kill every Hamas fighter in Rafa just as they didn't kill every Hamas fighter in Gaza City or k yunas they're still there a lot of them but they're not strong enough to threaten Israel and if if you create an alternative security presence they're probably not strong enough to dominate Gaza going forward a lot of a lot of Gaza Palestinians I know from my reporting do not like Hamas so I think people are finally beginning to think about the day after issues you like what does stability look like in the long run in a way that is better for Israel is better for the Palestinians and that's that's turning the page to that point it's taken seven months but the that's where things ought to be so just say one final personal thing I've been covering the Middle East a long time I think Hamas has done enormous damage to the Palestinians I think having sympathy for humas just just doesn't make sense to me given how they've operated I I think having Sympathy for the Palestinian people and their suffering or aspirations for Statehood and dignity is entirely appropriate but I I I Israel's goal of making sure that Hamas never governs G Gaza again I I think that's something that makes sense makes sense for everybody especially the Palestinians well just a couple a couple thesis and you respond to them one I don't think a two-state solution which I think most people agree is is a decent goal is possible with either Netanyahu or Hamas in charge do you agree with that yes and you said about having empathy and sympathy for the residents of Gaza I mean right now it's got the the greatest concentration of child amps in the world I mean it it's it's horrific uh and a lot of people I've talked a lot about this issue and a lot of people say Scott you need to differentiate between anti-Semitism and being um you know being anti-israel and being anti-semitic and I think that's a fair statement because my understanding is about Netanyahu is about 30% support so there's a lot of there's a lot of people in Israel that are kind of anti- decurrent Israeli leadership where I don't think there's as much sharp relief as people say you can have a lot of empathy for Palestinians and be anti Hamas because my understanding is I don't want to be clear people children people under the age of 18 victims humanitarian AG should absolutely um we need to protect it make sure it gets there but my understanding is samas actually has still a great deal of support among the Palestinian people and that a lot of these houses that the IDF goes into have connections to tunnels weapons um pictures of Hamas leaders that you know just as we held the German people accountable for the Third Reich is there really that much light in between the Palestinian people and Hamas so I think there's enough enough light and distance that equating the two and it's essentially imposing Collective punishment on the Palestinians is wrong morally and it's also wrong strategically it's a it's a guarantee for unending conflict um you're just not going I mean you're not going to kill all the Palestinians they may they may hate you but you got to find a way for them to have stable governance and you know gradually over time things change the US in fact held held the Nazi party responsible for what happened in Germany held the Japanese war machine responsible for for their War but didn't hold the people of those two countries is responsible and in indeed tried to help from from a very early moment when the war ended helped those people begin to De develop Pro Prosperity Democratic political systems and today to to me Japan and Germany are among the most successful Democratic countries I know precisely because we didn't impose Collective punishment on the people and uh you know I've spent I've been covering this Scott for it's way too long since 198 it's 40 almost 45 years I've lived in a Palestinian Village I went back to visit that that Village uh in December just to see the people who' taken me in and I'll say a couple things about them one interesting thing about the West Bank is it hasn't blown up during this nightmare War everybody was afraid it would but it hasn't why well partly palestin is you know Israel s sitting on them hard but they don't want the disaster that Hamas brought to Gaza to H to happen to them I may be naive in thinking that there's a way to successful two State solution I know it'll take years I know that both countries are really far from it but I also know that um if you don't start now you're just going to be stuck I've watched Israel and the Palestinian stuck in this misery for too long I want I I want it to move to a different place I try and I try to explain in my journalism how you do how you do that and and spend the time going Village to Village in the West Bank just to make sure I'm not crazy I'm not crazy to think that that you could get to something better and uh so that's that's what my reporting tells me for the purposes of push back and also not to prove a point but to learn here I I have a tremendous respect for your domain expertise and I am try to keep an open mind about this but when you say that we didn't hold the German and the Japanese people accountable I would push back we killed three and a half million Japanese including 100,000 in one night 5 a half million Germans were killed by the Allies including we continued to bomb in hurg and dresen well beyond when it had strategic objective other than convincing them that they needed to know that they lost and then holding the Palestinian people the way you're framing it is that the Israelis are taking a more what i' call inhuman approach to the Palestinians and the Allies did in World War II and I disagree with that and they're dropping leaflets they're leaving voicemails my sense is that they are doing their best to try and root out the combatants um who Hamas you know are using civilians as ammunition why is it you think that Israel is holding Palestinians to Greater account than the Allies held the Germans or the Japanese I I don't see the data to support that so I take your point that during that um allout fight uh in World War II the United States killed a lot of German and Japanese civilians the United States position nominally was to reduce the limit civilian casualties unlike the the British that were conducting strategic bombing of Germany mean hitting cities the US position was let's hit military facilities but that got blurred and and I I I don't agree in anyway that the killing was horrific uh there's evidence Evan Thomas's new book um about the road to surrender uh in with Japan it makes clear that Truman and Stimson thought that they were choosing a military Target in Hiroshima it wasn't the the aim point was right in the middle of town killing civilians but they thought they let they they convinced themselves that they had ruled out what the military wanted to do which was bomb kodo and and shatter the symbol of Japanese culture and and civilians there and they avoided that so they so um are we holding Israel to a to a different standard than we followed ourselves um maybe um you know we we live in a in a different time when you see War um on your on your TV every day in a way he didn't during World War World War II it's immediate and present and visceral I've talked a lot to people in the IDF you know I I've known covered Israel for you all these decades I have very good long-standing contacts the idea and I ask them what accounts for the high level of Civilian to Hamas casualties and by most estimates I know these Israelis are pushing back on this but by estimates of us intelligence um the ratio is unusually high and well beyond what we imposed in after some time in Iraq and Afghanistan so what accounts for that what's what's what's going wrong and when I asked that question uh IDF Israeli Air Force officers tell me about their Rules of Engagement about the algorithms they use to try to reduce the casualties but then they also tell me about the overrides that exists I just I look at these numbers Scott and um I think too many civilians have died relative to the number of Fighters more than was necessary um it's not to say that Israel is unique in that doing things different from what the US did during World War II I I don't not taking issue with that but could they have done this differently could they do it differently right now as they plan the Roth operation could they think carefully about how to reduce civilian suffering and death in this next phase that's what the US has been saying and I think that that's the right question to ask and I don't think that's a double standard at all it's a standard so so some things that are being done that I just find abhorent you know there there Israelis who are blocking quds of humanitarian assistance they are not the IDF the IDF is opening them up there were police units reporting to right-wing members of this governing Coalition who closed those quarters and the IDF came in and opened them because they know it's not in Israel's strategic interest to do this the idea of ha settler violence in the West Bank you know who the biggest enemy of that is the IDF because they've got to keep the lid on and these crazy settlers who blow down from the mountain tops and you know go on wearing masks and and uh kill people and what they say are Revenge attacks that drives the IDF crazy and tell me if you think this is an unfair question but I I I want to pose it anyways because you you really do sit at the intersection of warfare and DC and geopolitics but the scenario I always imagine is a jihadist or radical cartel is elected to lead Mexico and they incurrent to Texas under the opes of you have been de demonic to migrants you've been putting our kids in cages and it's based on this flawed Blasphemous ideology called Evangelical Christianity and we have an obligation to our god to come in and we've gotten Aid and we've been spent years building tunnels underneath the Texas Mexican border we come in and this might be fair or unfair but on a per capita basis kill about 30,000 Americans and then take 5,000 back and hide them in tunnels under Mexico and the question I was asked is what would we do and I believe our response would make Israel's response look gentle is that fair I I don't think it is entirely fair I'm just thinking about the wars that I've watched there was a nightmarish problem of of Isis violence that was sweeping across the Middle East just truly horrific pornographic violence just crazy ways of killing people and you know subjugating women in particular to to beastly conditions and the US decided to fight back so how did we do that well the first thing we did was to get an ally local Ally the one thing we didn't do adequately in Iraq or Afghanistan but we got people who were prepared to fight and die to do do the do the operations on the around and so the first thing you'd think about with Mexico is there'd be a lot of people who would be potential allies and you'd want to work with them um and then we thought about the need to move slowly and carefully so the the shaping of the operations against Isis took months people wonder what the heck is the US doing why why is it taking so long I remember I was able to go into Syria with the Special Operations Command repeatedly I kept thinking why are we going faster and the reason was to to shape it carefully so that when when you when you went in and to be quick and decisive so they went in they the capital of Isis was rqa they didn't take raqqa they they got all around it they begin recruiting tribes that that were had roots in raqqa they took the town next to raqqa called tabka they staged operations to to to squeeze they began to get the civilians out of rqa so that the people and Rocka mostly were the the fighters so when we say um there's a better way to do this than the way you're doing it we have some Authority in making that claim so how would we deal with Mexico I mean I don't know but I mean the right answer surely is we ought to find a way in that nightmare hypothetical scenario you describe to do a better job than Israel tragically you know with the greatest Sympathy for the dilemmas they faced than they did because too many people died we might be forced into that same situation we might kill an equivalent number of people but I hope we wouldn't have to that we'd be smarter and I hope Israel would be smarter David ignacius is a prizewinning columnist for the Washington Post and has been covering the
