# Building a $1,000,000 Business for a Stranger in 69 Minutes

Alex Hormozi helps Philip, owner of Garvey Disposal Services (trash collection business), transform his unprofitable operation into a scalable, profitable business through strategic focus, offer redesign, and aggressive customer acquisition.

## Core Thesis

When a business is spread too thin across multiple avatars and channels, the path to profitability is ruthless focus: **one avatar, one channel, one product to $1M+**. Fix the cash flow problem first by restructuring the offer to ensure first-payment covers CAC + COGS, then scale the most efficient acquisition channel aggressively.

## Business Situation

**Starting Point:**
- Revenue: $642,000/year
- Net Profit: -$151,000 (negative 23% margin)
- Customers: 2,500 (1,000 scatter + 13 HOAs with 1,500 doors)
- 2 years in business, former Amazon software engineer working 16hr/day
- Baby due in 6 weeks, family dependent on income
- $100,000+ in unexpected truck repairs
- Split focus: 2 avatars (scatter homes vs HOAs), 4-5 acquisition channels

**Unit Economics:**
- Scatter: CAC $51, LTV $1,000 (gross margin), 26-40% gross margin, 0.4% monthly churn
- HOAs: CAC $1,200, LTV $23,000, 23% gross margin
- Blended: CAC $67, LTV $1,300
- LTV:CAC ratios: 18-21:1 (excellent)
- Door-to-door: 26% close rate, 30% door open rate = 1 sale per 12 doors
- Monthly leads: 217, closing 72 (33% close rate)

## Key Strategic Decisions

### Decision 1: Avatar Selection - Choose Scatter Over HOAs

**The Choice:**
- **Scatter (individual homes):** Higher margins, faster sales cycles, no contracts, scalable acquisition
- **HOAs (homeowner associations):** Commoditized bidding wars, race to bottom pricing, long 3-5 year contracts

**Why Scatter Wins:**
- Can price aggressively without auction dynamics
- Door-to-door conversion: 1 sale per 12 doors knocked (insanely efficient)
- Once-weekly pickup = higher throughput per truck
- No contract lock-in = easier customer acquisition
- Can outmarket competition instead of being stuck in low-bid auctions

**HOA Reality:**
"I never want to have a commoditized service where I get into an auction because then it's always just going to be raced to the bottom... You're really in the efficiency business." (raw/Wr6n_zNKvMk-million-dollar-business.md:~150)

**Scaling Vision:**
- 10 commission-only door-to-door salespeople
- 5 sales/day/person × 10 people = 50 sales/day
- 1,500 customers/month = 18,000 customers/year
- Would exceed $1M profitability goal by 8x

### Decision 2: Acquisition Channel - Double Down on Door-to-Door

**Current Performance:**
- Philip: 300 doors/week, 26% close rate
- New rep (3 weeks in): averaging 5 sales/day, hit 7 in one day
- $50 commission per sale (salesperson collects first payment of $89)

**The Play:**
- Hire 10 commission-only reps immediately
- Invest $1,000-2,000 in recruiting (Indeed + Facebook ads)
- Conservative projection: 5 sales/day/person
- No risk - commission only, they collect their own payment

**Why Door-to-Door Dominates:**
- Customers naturally cluster on efficient routes
- Real-time objection handling
- High trust medium for local service
- Immediate pipeline visibility

### Decision 3: Offer Restructure - Fix the Cash Flow Problem

**The Core Problem:**
Cash collected in first 30 days must exceed CAC + COGS to scale without external capital.

**Math Breakdown:**
- CAC: $67
- COGS (3 months of service): $14/month × 3 = $42
- Minimum needed upfront: $109
- Sales commission: $50
- **Total needed: $159+**

**Old Offer:**
- $29.67/month (billed quarterly at $89)
- 3 months free (quarters 2, 3, 4)
- First payment: $89 (barely covers commission, doesn't cover COGS)

**New Offer - Acquisition Pricing:**
- Get started for $1
- First 3 months: $29/month with QR code OR $34/month without
- After 3 months: $49/month with QR code OR $54/month without
- First payment: $102 (3 months × $34)
- Minus $42 COGS, minus $50 commission = $10 buffer

**The QR Code Genius:**
- Put massive, ugly QR code on every bin as default
- Customers pay $5/month to remove it
- Creates "pain of choice" while raising base price to $34
- Those who keep it give you free advertising on most valuable real estate (their curb)
- QR codes link to dynamic landing pages with time-sensitive offers
- "The most valuable real estate of local marketing for your business" (raw/Wr6n_zNKvMk-million-dollar-business.md:~340)

**LTV Expansion:**
- Backend pricing increases from $29 to $49-54
- LTV jumps from $1,000 to $2,000-2,500
- More acquisition budget flexibility
- Better unit economics for scaling

## Tactical Implementation

### Sales Process (Door-to-Door Script)

**Approach:**
1. Knock 3 times (not just once)
2. Stand 12 inches back, slightly to side (visible through window, non-threatening)
3. Smile immediately when door opens

**Opening:**
"Hey, my name is [Name]. I'm with Garvey Trash Collection. We're in your neighborhood right now offering an insane promotion this month. And I wanted to see if you wanted to hear about it."

**Qualification:**
- Determine if they have current trash service
- If yes: "What do you like about them? What don't you like about them?"
- Transition: "I'm hearing what you don't like. That sounds a lot like we can actually solve that."

**Presenting the Offer:**
"It's a get started for $1 campaign. It's only for the next 250 people. We already have 50 people who've signed up in this neighborhood already. You start for $1 and then it's only $29 a month with a big ugly QR code on the bin - a lot of people don't care about that - or $34 without the QR code. We're just trying to get massive adoption in this area, it's an insane deal. You get the first three months at that price, then it goes to normal price of $49 or $54, and the first two months of bins are included. If you sign up today, I can get you started this week or next week."

**Objection Handling:**
- "What's stopping you?" → Answer objection
- "Does that clear everything up? Anything else blocking you?"
- "Need to talk to spouse" → Walk through value again
- "What if I want to cancel?" → "You can cancel anytime. It's month to month."

**Follow-up:**
- Leave card and flyer
- "When would be a good time for me to follow up?"
- Pin down specific day, return to neighborhood
- "Did you have a chance to think about it?"

### Referral System Overhaul

**Old System:**
- 1 free month per referral
- Free year after 10 referrals
- Minimal promotion/nurturing

**New System:**
1. **Aggressive Incentives:** Refer 3 people = free year at discounted price
2. **Consistent Nurturing:** Email every 2 weeks about referral program
3. **Gamification:** Top 10 referrer leaderboard, physically printed and delivered to customers
4. **Segmented Communication:** Different newsletters for HOAs vs scatter
5. **Progress Reminders:** "6 months left of your free year, refer 2 more people for another year"

**The Competitive Angle:**
"Every time you send that message, just have like a table of the people who have the most. And like that'll create some competition... And we're competing over who can refer the most trash collection. Like insanity. But like people do it." (raw/Wr6n_zNKvMk-million-dollar-business.md:~595)

**Unfair Advantage:**
All customers are geographically clustered - they can literally see their neighbor's bins with your branding. Social proof is built into the service delivery.

### Marketing & Advertising Improvements

**Meta Ads Transformation:**

**Old Ad:**
- Image: Nice neighborhood with bins
- Copy: "Tired of missing trash day? With Garvey Disposal, you never have to worry again. We provide reliable trash, recycling, and yard waste pickups for homeowners. Quality service, fair pricing, and a commitment to keeping your neighborhood clean. Switch today."
- Problem: No urgency, no scarcity, no reason to act now

**New Ad Approach:**
- Image: Janky trash can blown over, trash everywhere (PROBLEM visualization)
- Headline: "Missed trash day again?" (emotional agitation)
- Offer: "70% off for the first 300 people" or "70% off for next 6 months - only 43 spots left"
- Scarcity/urgency built in
- Larger trash can image, massive QR code in ad itself
- "Messy design" to grab attention

**Website Optimization:**
- Add popup offer box (20% off, limited time, etc.)
- Capture address immediately in form (name, email, phone, address)
- Option for phone number call-in (not just form)
- Multiple conversion paths

**New Channels to Test:**
1. **PPC (Google Ads):** "Trash collection near me" = ultra-high intent, start with $1-2k/month
2. **Facebook scaling:** Test $2,000/month with new offer vs old (split test)
3. **Supplementary to door-to-door** if economics work

### Operational Improvements

**Immediate Hires:**
1. **Inside sales rep:** Call down leads from forms, follow up via text/email until they say no
2. **Pay:** $25/hour or salary
3. **Urgency:** "Do this today, before you leave" (raw/Wr6n_zNKvMk-million-dollar-business.md:~560)

**Bin Strategy - Create Remarkable Service:**
- Make bins "the most insane bins anyone's ever seen"
- Shiniest, nicest, longest-lasting
- Immediate replacement if broken ("I got you, I'll be there today, we'll swap it out")
- Offer bin swaps for existing customers (introduce QR code bins)
- Exceptional service + lower prices = word of mouth

**The Remarkability Play:**
"Right now you're just not being talked about a lot and I think the way that you make people talk about you is you do kind of crazy things. And the only problem is that you're like I'm in trash collection like yeah but so is everyone else like you can still be crazy about it." (raw/Wr6n_zNKvMk-million-dollar-business.md:~625)

### Launch Week Strategy

**"Insane Week" Campaign:**
- Most aggressive offer of the year (e.g., first week free, bins included)
- Saturate target zone with all channels simultaneously:
  - Door knockers (all 10 reps)
  - Flyers on cars
  - Meta ads
  - QR codes on existing bins promoting the offer
- Goal: Create buzz, get people talking about trash collection
- Leverage 0.4% churn - once they sign up, they stay forever

## Core Principles & Frameworks

### The Focus Framework

**"One Avatar, One Channel, One Product to $1M+"**

"You're at that stage where like I like having one avatar, one channel, one product up to a million dollars or more, right? And you're kind of you're right there, right? And so you have two avatars and like five channels... And so you feel spread thin." (raw/Wr6n_zNKvMk-million-dollar-business.md:~395)

**Why it works:**
- Every new assumption decreases likelihood of success
- Focus compounds effort
- Easier to optimize one thing than multiple things simultaneously

### The "Fewest Need-to-Believes" Planning

**Framework:**
"I like to make a plan on like the fewest need to believe is possible. Like every single new assumption that we introduce like dramatically decreases the likelihood that it occurs." (raw/Wr6n_zNKvMk-million-dollar-business.md:~460)

**Application:**
"If only ONE thing were true - we get 10 commission-only door-to-door reps doing 5 sales/day - what would stop us? Not much: just the offer restructure and recruiting."

### The Cash Flow First Principle

**Formula:**
First 30 days cash collection > (CAC + COGS for fulfillment period)

**Why it matters:**
Enables scaling without external capital, eliminates cash flow crisis, allows aggressive customer acquisition.

### Commoditization vs Differentiation

**Commoditized Markets (HOAs):**
- Race to bottom pricing
- Efficiency is only competitive advantage
- Low margin, high volume
- Contract lock-in reduces flexibility

**Differentiated Markets (Scatter):**
- Pricing power
- Service quality matters
- Word of mouth works
- Marketing advantage compounds

### The Retention Multiplier

With 0.4% monthly churn (95%+ annual retention):
- Aggressive front-end offers pay off exponentially
- LTV becomes primary metric, not first transaction profit
- Can afford to "lose money" on acquisition if backend holds
- "Once they sign up like they stay... I'm not overly worried about them leaving because the LTV is so strong" (raw/Wr6n_zNKvMk-million-dollar-business.md:~575)

## Actionable Takeaways

1. **Fix Cash Flow Math:** Restructure offers so first payment covers CAC + COGS for next billing period before you scale acquisition
2. **One Thing:** Identify your single best avatar + channel combo and 10x down on it before adding complexity
3. **Commission-Only Sales Army:** For local services with good unit economics, hire 10 commission-only reps immediately - zero risk, pure upside
4. **Use Your Product as Marketing:** The QR code strategy turns every customer's curb into a billboard - find your version of this
5. **Make Boring Remarkable:** Even trash collection can generate word-of-mouth if the service is exceptional and the offer is aggressive enough
6. **Gamify Referrals:** Leaderboards, frequent reminders, and aggressive incentives turn customers into salespeople
7. **Test Urgency/Scarcity:** "70% off for next 300 people" converts better than "quality service, fair pricing" - give people a reason to act NOW
8. **Hire for Follow-Up:** Most businesses lose 50%+ of leads due to poor follow-up - hire someone at $25/hour to call every lead immediately
9. **Plan with Fewest Assumptions:** The simpler your path to goal, the more likely you succeed - reduce dependencies
10. **Backend Pricing Power:** If retention is strong, make money on months 4-120, not month 1 - allows aggressive acquisition

## Relevance to Wilde Agency

### Direct Applications

1. **Offer Design for Service Businesses:** The cash flow math (first payment > CAC + COGS) is universal for any service business. Applies to marketing retainers, consulting engagements, done-for-you services.

2. **Commission Sales Structure:** For local/regional service businesses, commission-only sales forces eliminate risk and scale acquisition. Consider for client acquisition in specific verticals.

3. **QR Code Strategy Adaptation:** Turn deliverables into marketing assets. Reports could have "Powered by Wilde Agency" with QR codes to case studies. Clients become billboards.

4. **Referral Gamification:** Implement leaderboard system for client referrals. Monthly email: "Top 5 referrers this quarter get X." Make it visible, make it competitive.

5. **The "Insane Week" Launch:** When launching new service lines or entering new markets, concentrate firepower into one explosive week rather than slow-drip launch.

### Strategic Principles

1. **Focus Before Scale:** Don't add new service lines, new ICPs, or new channels until current offering is at $1M+ and systematized. One avatar, one offer, one channel.

2. **Fewest Assumptions Planning:** When building growth plans for clients, identify the ONE thing that, if true, would guarantee success. Build entire strategy around making that one thing happen.

3. **Commoditization Awareness:** If a client operates in a race-to-bottom market, shift strategy from pricing competition to efficiency operations or find differentiated sub-segment.

4. **LTV-First Thinking:** For clients with strong retention, optimize for aggressive front-end acquisition even at break-even or loss. Make money over lifetime, not first transaction.

5. **Remarkability in Boring Industries:** The trash collection bins lesson - even the most mundane service can generate word-of-mouth if execution is exceptional enough. Challenge clients in "boring" industries to find their remarkable angle.

### Client Consulting Frameworks

1. **The Avatar-Channel Decision Matrix:**
   - Map all possible avatar + channel combos
   - Identify the one with best unit economics and scalability
   - Sunset everything else temporarily
   - Return to complexity only after $1M+ achieved

2. **Cash Flow Offer Audit:**
   - Calculate CAC + COGS through next billing cycle
   - Ensure first payment exceeds this number
   - If not, restructure pricing/payment terms
   - Test backend price increases for existing customers

3. **Referral System Build:**
   - Design aggressive incentive (free year after X referrals)
   - Create leaderboard system
   - Bi-weekly email automation
   - Physical printed materials for top referrers
   - Segment by customer type

4. **Sales Process Documentation:**
   - Script door-to-door equivalent for their channel
   - Objection handling playbook
   - Follow-up scheduling system
   - Commission structure aligned with cash collection

### Business Development Insights

1. **Target Distressed Service Businesses:** Companies like Philip's (good economics, bad execution) are perfect consulting clients. They need strategic clarity more than tactical execution.

2. **Commission-Only Partnership Model:** Offer to build sales systems in exchange for percentage of new revenue. Lower risk for cash-strapped businesses.

3. **Vertical-Specific Playbooks:** Create "Hormozi-style" teardown playbooks for specific industries (home services, B2B services, etc.) as lead magnets.

4. **The 69-Minute Promise:** Consider offering "business turnaround sprint" sessions - concentrated strategic planning sessions that deliver complete clarity in single sitting. High-ticket diagnostic offer.

### Psychological Selling Lessons

1. **Pain of Choice:** The QR code strategy uses psychological pricing brilliantly - customers feel they're choosing, even though both options benefit the business.

2. **Urgency Creation:** "Only 300 people" or "This week only" converts infinitely better than "quality service" messaging.

3. **Social Proof Through Visibility:** Bins on curbs = social proof. Find the equivalent for every business - what's visible to neighbors/peers?

4. **Objection Pre-emption:** Address "what if I want to cancel" before they ask. Transparency builds trust.

### Operational Excellence Standards

1. **Same-Day Response:** The "hire someone today" urgency should apply to client onboarding, lead follow-up, and deliverable turnaround.

2. **Exceptional Delivery:** "Most insane bins anyone's ever seen" - what's our equivalent? Reports, dashboards, client communication, results?

3. **Proactive Issue Resolution:** "Bin broke? I'll be there today to swap it" - anticipate client problems and solve before they escalate.

### Pricing & Packaging

1. **Acquisition vs Core Pricing:** Consider two-tier pricing - aggressive "new client special" that covers costs, then graduated to full pricing at renewal.

2. **Backend Revenue Optimization:** If client retention is strong, test 10-20% price increases for existing clients every 12 months.

3. **Bundle Forced Choice:** Similar to QR code strategy, create bundles where "basic" and "premium" both hit desired margin, but premium feels like better value.

---

**Final Meta-Insight:** This episode demonstrates that business transformation isn't about complex strategy - it's about ruthless prioritization, unit economic clarity, and aggressive execution on the ONE thing that moves the needle. Philip didn't need 10 new tactics; he needed to stop doing 8 things and 10x down on the 2 that actually worked.
