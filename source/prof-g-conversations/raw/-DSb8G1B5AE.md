you said the United States has strong institutions but a weak society and Israel has a very strong Society but weak institutions American society is broken deaths of Despair from drug abuse alcohol abuse and suicide at record levels Israel on every one of these metrics is not just doing a little better it's in an opposite direction Israelis are living longer than Europeans Americans there's no loneliness crisis there's no Teen Mental Health crisis uh there's a sense of happiness and optimism even during low points Israel ranks the fourth happiest country in the [Music] world Dan where does this podcast find you New York City nice so we actually have a history we you and my sister were roommates what 25 30 years ago right out of college in DC you know I I I appreciate the reference I don't appreciate the because implying that is the is the age you know it's like whenever I on my podcast when I have folks on I always when their old friends I always say longtime friends rather than old friends because people are very sensitive to anything that involves multiple decades and here we are yes it was the mid 1990s so it was 1995 I was a young Congressional AG so yeah that was wow close to three decades wow that's wild and you so let's bust right into it you wrote this book The Genius of Israel the surprising resilience of a divided nation in a turbulent world and quite frankly the frame changed dramatically with the events of October the 7th give us a sense you've kind of become this unofficial spokesperson for uh what it feels like to be Jewish in the US right now talk to us about as um an observant Jew your observations around and I'm not an observant Jew um what I would describe as a surprising amount of anti-Semitism I I the way I describe it is you know they say 2/3 of an iceberg Mass are below the surface in this instance it feels like 99% of anti-Semitism was below the service I'm just shocked I didn't know it was there so I will tell you um I've been living and breathing Jewish life my entire life uh I'm a moderately I guess observant Jew depending on different what what stage of Life uh I've been in uh but I've been deeply immersed in Jewish communal life my entire life and I have been very involved with the state of Israel and with us Israel relations certainly most of my life my adult life I I'm the son of a holocaust Survivor so my mother who's 85 years old who lives in Jerusalem today uh is a is her father was killed in awit she and her mother barely escaped the train to owitz uh she and her siblings were on the run she was hidden out by uh what we call Righteous Gentiles who risked their lives to to save her life as a little girl uh parts of her family Beyond just her father were wiped out um my wife and I took her and her you know 15 members of our family back to her hometown coincidentally and eerily just this past summer we went to the home where she was chased out of by the Nazis we had three generations of the family traveling with us her generation my generation and all of our my siblings and and my kids we it was a Roots trip and we went to aitz too where her father was killed so I I I tell you all this as background that the stories of the Holocaust the stories of anti-Semitism was sort of like in the water when I was growing up it was in it was at home was with us all the time my mother had this element of she was she was she benefited tremendously from the joys of Jewish life but she also always was looking over her shoulder a little bit and there was which is understandable and I intellectually related to that but I never truly yeah like viscerally I never felt it I always thought I understood why she felt it but I didn't feel it until October 7th this is the first time here I am in my early 50s this is the first time in my life where I kind of get it I I I feel vulnerable I just by the way it's not just me I almost every Jew I live know who lives a public Jewish life feels feels like they're sort of looking over their shoulder like my mother did my children go to a Jewish Day School I see the security around the school that's had to be amped up I mean it's I you know the stories it's everywhere and this this is new I never thought I would feel this and see this I don't speak nearly as eloquently or with as much credibility around this issue as you but I have decided that you know I never I I benefited hugely from Jewish culture but I've never really given back and I thought okay this is my one opportunity to sort of give back and I've been fairly outspoken and I'll have you respond to some of the push back I get because I think some of the push back has some value and creates a productive conversation some of the push back I get initially is Scott being anti-israel doesn't make you anti-semitic and I'm curious about how you would bifurcate the feelings of people especially it's me there's just an entirely different Viewpoint among young people in America versus people of our generation of the distinction between being anti-semitic and anti-israel so I personally have been critical of Israeli government policy at various times over the years uh I probably less so than uh others I know but I totally respect even those who are much more critical of Israeli government policy than than I've been I think they come at it in good faith certainly over the last year incidentally between January of 2023 and October 7th of 2023 uh I was I I raised a lot of questions and concerns about Israeli domestic government policy is it relates to this judicial reform effort so I I think it's completely legitimate to be critical of Israeli government policy as one would be of any government's policies the distinction I draw when someone is critical of Israel is do you hold Israel to a different standard than you would hold any other country so one can criticize Israeli government policy like they criticize any government's policy but with Israel somehow then it always devolves into a debate about whether or not Israel has a right to exist it's not just about the policies of the government it's about the legitimacy of Israeli statehood and as though Israel's statehood is a manifestation of something illegitimate and we can get into what those charges all are some form of you know colonization or imperialism from the west or you know they they they then like project on these other explanations for Israel's existence that should delegitimize the right to Israel's existence but if you if you criticize Israel of course that's okay and that is not anti-Semitism in fact look at the majority of Israelis majority of Israelis are very critical of Israeli government policy at any given moment so let's just put it in the current context and I and I'm sure we'll get into this but and we and there's layers and layers and we can get very granular on different issues but Israel's right to defend itself against a a genocidal threat that many believed before October 7th was largely rhetorical that was sure it was articulated in the charter of Hamas that that Hamas intended to wipe Israel off the map and Slaughter Jews on mass but there was a sense that they wouldn't actually try to do it now we know they're they want to do it right you know many friends of mine in the geopolitical uh analytical World often say when when Bad actors publish repeatedly what they want to do take them at their word whether it was what Hitler wrote in minec whether it was that 5,000-word essay that Putin wrote uh some years ago about what he wanted to do in Ukraine when they project when they write what they're going to do you should pay attention to it Hamas had written what it wanted to do and then it tried to do it on October 7th now we can get into a debate about how Israel should respond but if if you question whether or not Israel has a right to defend itself against this threat in a way that you have you have tolerated and in some cases supported any country to defend itself against comparable threats then you are holding Israel to a different standard than you hold any other country and that therefore is inherently a double standard which is a form of discrimination and that's when I think you start to get into questions about is there a distinction between knee-jerk anti-zionism and anti-Semitism and I think what we are seeing now is that's not the case I mean you look at the absurdity of some of the criticisms of Israel in response to October 7th it is so utterly tragically clear that Israel is being held to a standard that these same people who are out protesting are would never hold another country to I'll put forward a series of thesis and you tell me where where you disagree or agree I think America has played a vital role in this and the Biden Administration doesn't get enough credit I think Hamas was looking to do two things one Inspire Global sympathy and attention to their cause I think they've achieved that unfortunately I I really do I think they've tapped into a ground soll of anti-Semitism that we did know was there and two I thought they were hoping to inspire a multi-front war against Israel and that has not happened largely because of two carrier strike forces sitting off the coast that are basically saying if you do this we're going to re violence on you and that is what unfortunately geopolitics mostly comes down to so one curious about how you feel about the Biden Administrations handling of this and um um what you think about uh let's start there the Biden administration's approach to this I uh as as you know my my uh General political Outlook would not lead me to a place where I praise uh look for reasons to praise the Biden Administration and I have been very publicly uh supportive of uh and and praising of President Biden in his handling of this war and and I want I want to take a moment on on this because I think it's important to your point Scott if as Hamas was plotting this and whoever else was helping them from Tran to nasella in Lebanon to God knows who else when they were plotting October 7th if you would have asked them that hey within 5 days of this massacre the commanderin-chief of the most powerful military in the world would not have only given an incredibly I thought incredibly moving address empathizing with the true victims of this massacre the Jewish people in the way that he did that Saturday uh on October 7th and would have a couple days after that gotten on Air Force One and flown to Israel the commander-in-chief of the most powerful army in the world no president's ever done that Israel's been in plenty of wars and the US has done a lot to help Israel whether it was during the first Iraq war when President George HW Bush you know provided Patriot missile technology to shoot down scuds whether it was uh Nixon in in 73 with its military airlift that really saved uh Israel helped saved Israel in a pretty dark period of the Yum kipur War you can go back but a president getting on the plane and going to the war zone and he didn't just go to the war zone he he met with the Israeli War cabinet he sat there with Netanyahu and Gans and ID uh Eisen cot and and and the the entire War cabinet as though he was a member of their team and and obviously he met with families of the hostages and he he did you know he did a lot on the ground and then provide did has provided we're still waiting for the Congressional passage of this this large $14 billion plus age packet package but he has still provided a lot of important supplies and then you mentioned the air carriers and the 2000 Marines in the region and the squadrons and I mean I can go on and on and on and on and and explicitly told tan and Hezbollah don't even think for a moment about trying to capitalize on this I bet it wasn't in hamas's Playbook that that's what the week after October 7th was going to look like and so I I repeatedly say as far as Israel's concerned the US Israel relationship is Paramount and and President Biden deserves a lot of credit now I have some concerns about I think there's a little bit of good cop bad cop going on in the administration right now and certainly you look at some of the things that vice president Hara said over the last few days that I think are disconcerting um these five principles that she articulated which are mostly unrealistic and I think there's some in the administ I think the administration is divided I think there are some in the administration that are concerned about domestic politics and pressure they're getting from their Left Flank that they need to try to figure out how to mify uh with regard to the position pres by taken but by and large the person who's holding the line on the administration's approach is the president himself and so it's a long window way of saying I I I think his support has been extremely important what are your thoughts about normalization between the kingdom and Israel so I think that Saudi Israeli normalization was very far along uh in uh on the eve of October 7th much farther along than than even in the Press here in the United States that were following it believed if you look at the UN General Assembly meetings uh in September in New York you look at what MBS was saying publicly look at what Netanyahu was saying publicly I you know and and they it was it was it was moving it was moving fast and I think it was going to happen before the end of this year because they wanted to get it done while Biden got consumed by the presidential election which was going to happen next year and and the Biden Administration was key to getting it done because there were going to be some Senate Democrats in any kind of um defense pcta between the US and Saudi that was key to this there were going to be some Senate Democrats who were critics of uh of Saudi that wouldn't want to go along with it which is why Biden was key the Biden was going to deliver the Senate Democrats so I think it was fast moving um October 7th actually is has paused it part of the reason Saudi Arabia wanted to integrate or or normalize with Israel is as one very prominent leader Saudi leader said to me uh about four or five years ago uh he said look we view Israel as the future and we want to partner with the future and why do we we we want to innovate we want to co-innovate with the leading innovators in the world why do we have to get onto on a 17-hour flight to San Francisco and go to the B Bay Area when we want to innovate we have a Silicon Valley in our backyard his words a three-hour flight from Riad is Tel Aviv why why aren't we just partnering with them on on food Tech on cyber security on on you know Health healthc Care Innovations on I mean it can go on and on and on they you know there these these are some of the areas they were particularly focused on why do we have to schlep my word to um to the Bay Area to do that so they wanted to integrate with Israel economically and technologically and undergirding all of this is that Israel and Saudi face a common threat they have strategic National Security strategic reasons to work together they have a common threat in Iran and have a common threat in extreme Sunni Muslim Arab activism or at worse terrorism in the case of Saudi Arabia the threat is for Muslim Brotherhood in the case of Israel the threat is Hamas as we're seeing so they they had a whole bunch of reasons to partner Saudis saw in Israel not only a technology superpower and an regionally and economic superpower but it saw in Israel a security and intelligence Juggernaut and they wanted to piggyback on all of it the big setback of October 7th is I think the Saudis look at Israel and say huh we thought you guys were a security and intelligence Juggernaut how does a security and intelligence Juggernaut completely miss this Miss October 7th so if anything the Israel's weakness on October 7th is what is setting back the potential for Saudi Israeli normalization which is why the Israelis generally believe and the Israelis and the leadership I personally believe this idea that Israel needs to be tempered in its response as a way to get the Saudi Israeli normalization back on track I think is completely misguided if Israel is tempered Israel will look weak it will look weak if a country can unleash the attempted genocide that that this what Israel thought and the region thought was a ragtag militia the way it did on October 7 it makes Israel look like a paper tiger and a paper tiger is not what the Saudis are going to want to do business with in the 1973 yum kipur War for the first couple of weeks Israel was completely set back completely caught off guard and embarrassed and then Israel bounced back and when Israel bounced back within a matter of months it was not only s surrounding the Egyptian third Army in the Sin but it was staring down at Damascus and Cairo and they could have taken either one of those cities they didn't the point is it was it was unequivocal Israel's ultimate victory in 1973 was unequivocal you go to US military cies they don't study The Six Day War even though the Six Day War is the arguably the more impressive War they that the US military cies they study the 1973 yumore War because a story of bounceback of resilience of turning things around and how Israel did it and what Israel ultimately did in 1973 is they exposed Egypt's military and Syria's military as the Paper Tigers and it's not surprising that within less than a decade Israel had the a peace treaty with one of those two countries with Egypt which at the time was the Saudi Arabia of the region is because Israel demonstrated strength and if you fast forward to today I think the big risk for Israel is the IDF after what happened on October 7 looks like the paper tiger and and an IDF that looks like a paper tiger is not one that Saudi going to want to do business with Israel's contract with its own people was broken on October 7th because of that security collapse and it has to repair that but it also has to do it to repair its geopolitical position and I think if it demonstrates that it has wiped out this Hamas threat and it has restored security and that October 7th was bad it was a setback but in the scheme of History it will be viewed as a hiccup I think we could have Saudi Israeli normalization within a year so just along the lines of being optimistic about a a you know how we move forward and hopefully develop something resembling a sustainable piece in the US One it feels to me in hindsight Obama's decision to withdraw from the Middle East was a a mistake that without without whatever you want to call us the world's policeman it it there was a vacuum that was filled by people who W didn't represent Western interests I don't think there's ever going to be a sustainable peace with Hamas in power which I'm sure you agree with what you probably disagree with is I don't think there's a sustainable pieace as long as Netanyahu is in office and that is um I just think the disassembly of the of of the courts the way they have approached I I quite frankly Dan I think his approach to Hamas is or not Hamas his approach to Gaza has been diabolical I mean actually supporting Hamas and an attempt to divide the country further um that the only sustainable peace is going to be uh obviously you can't have a terrorist organization representing a government whose only amendment is the termination of a of a race of people but I also don't think it's sustainable as long as we have kind of this farri government in Israel and I'm curious what your thoughts are there I have known Netanyahu for a long time I um I have been supportive of many things he's done uh over his many decades of of Public Service uh I have been deeply concerned before October 7th uh about some of the way his government has has tackled certain issues you mentioned judicial reform which is one of them but not the only one uh since he returned to power in 2023 uh I I think the Israelis are ruthless about accountability and scrutiny when there are security setbacks ruthless I mean the United States could learn something from this if you look at what happened after the Yum kipur War even though Israel ultimately was successful and won the war it ended golden mayor's career there was a commission of inquiry and set back the labor party really for a generation politically you look at the 2006 second Lebanon war ended audom Mert's uh political life uh I think that the idea there will be a commission of inquiry after this war and the idea that Netanyahu is going to be let off the hook I just don't buy it he was he was he was prime minister when it happened now In fairness he wasn't the only prime minister since his Israel disengaged from Gaza Israel left Gaza in 2005 since Israel left from Gaza there was prime minister Chiron there was prime minister Omar there was prime minister Bennett there was prime minister Leed and then there was prime minister Netanyahu so there were many prime ministers who were all familiar with Israel's policy he but he he more than anyone shaped the policy I think just look at the politics of the country right now where public opinion is there's no way any prime minister can politically survive something like this this is catastrophic as I said it's worse than the yumore War I I can't think of another setback Israel is face that is as bad as this and it not only happened on his watch but he was Mr security the his whole political brand was you may not like me you may not like me but I'll keep you safe right well so much for that and so and so I just think this question can he can he be the one I just don't I just don't think he will be the one we'll be right back so let's let's move to your book the thing that struck me in your book and I love this line you said the United States has strong institutions but a weak society and Israel has a very strong Society but weak institutions say more look in the in the United States and and you've you've written extensively about this uh and I know your audience is is very familiar with it but I I want to just spend a moment on it to establish the contrast Israel American society is broken we have record levels of loneliness we have uh a demographic crisis Brewing people aren't having children anymore at least not at the rates they were which means our population like many populations around the world are going to are aging and shrinking these are aging and most western affluent democracies are aging and shrinking now Japan is at the pointy end of the spear I was in Japan last April and I was meeting with some government officials who point to the fact that its population is shrinking as the biggest threat to the country not China not China the biggest threat to Japan is they're an aging and shrinking country and aging and shrinking countries become economically busted because the younger there aren't enough young people to support older people and they become less Innovative you have a loneliness epidemic you have a you have a mental health crisis you have a Teen Mental Health crisis and I know you've written a lot about it and the phrase I never in a million years thought I would see and I'm the father of two teenage boys as I know you are the CDC comes out with this report a few months ago there's a teen suicide crisis just that term a teen like that's a thing you know record staggering levels of teens attempting suicide or committing suicide and I can go on and on and on with with how you know uh uh longevity um death deaths of Despair um from drug abuse alcohol abuse and suicide at record levels so Israel on every one of these metrics and this is what we lay out in the book every one of these metrics is in is is not just doing a little better it's in an opposite direction Israel's population its fertility is way above the replacement level Israelis are having lots and lots of children it's not just the ultra Orthodox families it's secular hypers secular Israelis working in Tech in the coolest hippest parts of very hedonistic Tel Aviv are having three four and five children Israelis are living longer than Europeans Americans there's no loneliness crisis there's no Teen Mental Health crisis uh there's a sense of happiness and optimism even during low points Israel ranks the fourth happiest country in the world and when I raise this friends of mine who write about this issue with when they point the to the Brokenness of American society they point to things like well what do you expect from from why people are living with such despair in the United States they're all they're hearing about is is climate change catastrophe young people are only hearing about school shootings there's political polarization is off the charts and uh and you know they go on and on and on and on and I and I point out Israel has every one of those things oh by the way and they're spending all their time scrolling on their phones so it is true Americans are exposed to a lot of information about climate catastrophe so are Israelis you want to talk about gun violence I mean young Israelis almost every one of them at age 18 go to serve in the military and they know what it's like to have their lives on their lines or To Lose Friends and to lose loved ones they they really know what violence in their daily life is about political polarization in Israel at times is off the charts especially in 2023 where you had hundreds of thousands of people people storming the streets every Saturday night to protest and Israeli kids have as much access to smartphones as anyone else so why like Israel has all these Dynamics it has weak institutions as we saw in the judicial reform debate in 2023 as we saw in Israel's immediate response to October 7th weak institutions we weak government institutions but the society is thriving people feel connected to each other they feel connected to the country they feel connected to community they feel connected to to um their families and so how does that manifest itself one and I'm just going to give a couple examples in the book we go through a whole bunch you can't underestimate the role of national service so the fact that a majority of Israelis at their formative years in their lives 18 19 20 21 don't go to college they don't and they don't spend the years leading up to that trying to get into the best college the Sorting system in the United States is is the college application process which is all about everything about the college application process is me I my performance individual Excellence how did I do what are my grades what are my SAT tests what kind of reference letters can I persuade someone how am I better than the person on my left and right right where in Israel if you want to serve when you everyone most people serve in the military the goal is to get into the best units possible it doesn't matter how talented you are are no matter doesn't matter what kind of individual Excellence you have if you can't work with other people if you can't serve as part of a team effectively if you don't understand what it means to be part of a group if you don't have a communal mindset you won't get admitted to those best units and so the whole incentive system as kids are getting older beginning with youth movements when they're young the Army when they're 18 all the incentives are about how do I perform with other people not just me and I will be rewarded based on how I work with other people people it changes the whole culture of the country um and you know uh we write in the book about the role of Shabbat of Friday nights of the Sabbath we we call it Thanksgiving every week now some Jews observe it more religiously and traditionally than others but the point is the overwhelming majority of Israelis shut down every Friday night to be with family friends two generations three generations sometimes four generations and there's a sense that they are they are sharing in that experience with the people they love and they're sharing and the whole country is sharing that experience Dan cenor is a best-selling author the host of the call me back podcast and a co-founder of the board of directors of the foreign policy initiative he also serves as a partner in Elliot management previously Dan served as a senior adviser to former speaker Paul Ryan's campaign for vice president and foreign policy adviser to Senator Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns his new book The Genius of Israel the surprising resilience of a divided nation in a turbulent world is out now he joins us from his home in Manhattan Dan I remember I took Ashley my younger sister we referenced before to Washington DC on a tour of DC hoping that it would Inspire her and the good news was it it did the bad news is she immediately became an intern in some crazy right-wing Republicans office and me as a you know a deep blue Progressive and then I met you and you were another Republican I'm like oh my God I failed yeah like coming at me from all directions this didn't this didn't pan out the way it had hoped and now I look back on that fondly uh cuz I just think you've grown into such an impressive man and I really also just want to say I appreciate uh the resilience and the courage you're showing around this issue anyways Dan I'm I'm just thrilled to reconnect with you and congratulations on the life and the success you've built thank you Scott obviously that uh means a lot to me I do remember your visits and I will say as much as you felt that your sister was getting uh uh enveloped by crazy right-wing with Republicans we will look back with they seem moderate yeah quaint that was a quaint time they seem reasonable we're going to romanticize the Gingrich era of the 1990 100% it's the reasonable on all right brother stay safe thanks [Music] thank [Music]
