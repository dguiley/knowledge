I have 400 bucks in my bank account I'm putting everything else on a credit card what was the biggest objection that you think Dan the sales guy had to overcome to get you to see the value in hiring a coach at the end of the call he's like hey what do you want to do and I said well I'm going go and try to get our partners on board hopefully I'm able to get out of a contract with our agency and he said try and hope aren't strategies what are you going to do and I said I'm going to get our partners on board and I'm going to let go of our marketing agency I think when anyone looks back over their life they can see a couple of moments when they're like hey I could have gone left or right and uh that was certainly one of those moments that had a pretty significant impact all right Johnny pagee welcome to your own podcast I'm excited to be doing this man it's gonna be kind of weird we don't have a third person here to shine the light on like I've got to turn in the hot seat here uh and you're you're driving so this will be fun yeah and I got my Spotlight cranked up to 11 dude so I hope you're ready hope you brought some sunscreen um so for for the people listening to this right you know Johnny and I were talking with the podcast team and we realized like we spend a lot of time focusing on everybody in our world the incredible like guests we've had on and our coaches and our clients but I don't know that we've actually taken the time to walk people through who we are and how we ended up running Zas Academy and the crazy Journeys that have been there so today's is all about Johnny and you know if I had to take a guess I think most of the people listening to this probably know you one of two ways ways either number one they know you as a leader in SAS Academy maybe they've been coached by you on a call if they're part of our world or they're potentially someone you've worked with or LED in either silver track or or the academy so all that being said there's a lot of recent context but not as much like setup story and so before we talk business and silver track and SAS Academy and all that stuff maybe just set the table for a second like what was the story of your childhood how did you grow up like what kind of stuff did you go through as a young man I don't know man just kind of read us in on on young Johnny yeah cool well I I was born in Los Angeles and at the age of five my parents decided to move across the country to Pastor a church in North Carolina and I remember my parents when they told us that I remember them rolling out a map and showing us where North Carolina was because I thought we were moving to a different country um so we we H basically a different country basically a different country um so we uh we load up a a giant Yellow Rider moving van and my dad and my brother uh and I drive across country my mom ended up flying out she was pregnant with my my younger brother and um fly across the country and we had one tape deck in the uh in the van hoodie and the blow hoodie and the Blowfish so anytime one of those songs comes on uh jogs memory and uh and then my dad promised that every hundred miles across the country we would stop and play baseball so we had a a you know bat and glove and a ball under the front seat with my brother and I'd be sitting it was like a a moving van a bench seat and we'd be uh watching the odometer one mile at a time we'd be like Dad it's 100 miles we got to stop we jump out no matter of where we were side of the freeway rest stop gas stations Across America we uh played baseball until we landed in North Carolina and the first Sunday the church my dad moved across the country to pastor had 14 people in it and the Second Sunday there were six um so this was not some I mean we moved like literally right next door to a dairy farm and it was a totally different change of pace in life so ended up being a really cool place to grow up it was in the mountains of North Carolina in a town called Boon and um really no no early um interest in entrepreneurship I watched my dad work multiple jobs I was the oldest of five kids so watched my dad work multiple jobs he was never a full-time pastor always had multiple different um jobs to make in's meet and uh maybe when I was about 10 12 he uh bought his first business or kind of earned his way into a what I later found out was an entrepreneurial route into owning a company called High Country cabinets and U my dad's been uh running a custom kitchen and Cabinetry company for the last 20 years but never really like high interest in business specifically I but I always felt like I never questioned whether or not I would go to college and then end up in business in some capacity but when I was about 16 years old I started playing golf I had grown up playing all kinds of sports and um just got really interested in golf at the age of 16 and ended up going to appalachin State University my freshman year of college decided not to play golf in college for my first year and over the summer I just happened to have a a conversation with a good friend of mine who had played at a school called Lincoln Memorial University and we were both working at a golf course playing the way the cool thing was we would when the Pro Shop closed at 5 in the summer there was probably another like three and a half four hours worth of summer so all the bosses would go home and it just just me US cart guys left to collect all the golf carts wash them put them away in the cart barn and so as soon as the Pro Shop would close we would grab our clubs load up a golf cart we go out and play and then we' come back to a parking lot full of golf carts we'd wash them all up and put them away and it was one of those nights that a buddy asked me he's like dude why don't you just come play at Lincoln Memorial like why don't you to come you're you're going to App State don't love it you're you're not playing golf you only get one shot and this was about two weeks before the school year started oh wow and um I'm what year was this was this after your first year at Appalachian State yes I did my freshman year at Appalachian State University this is the summer so in the summmer I'd get a job at that summer I was working at two golf courses I just work six days a week I'd save up all my money over the summer to not have to have a job through the school year and uh I was you know one of those days late July and um my buddy Josh cornette says hey why don't you come play and I'm like I don't think I ever could we end up calling the coach he's like I'm happy to have you as a walk-on you could earn your way into a scholarship position but if you want to come over work hard and uh see what you make of it I'm happy to have you on the team and I ended up transferring a week and a half before school year started to a school called Lincoln Memorial University and played uh for three years on their golf team and that was one of the most rewarding and exciting you know seasons of my life and I at that point just I thought my career would only evolve into playing golf professionally like that was it was PGA Tour or bust I was fully assumed by the game of golf and um yeah did that for like the next four or five years that's wild man but we'll talk more about the golf thing in a second but I actually um you got me thinking so I didn't know um I knew that you had moved when your dad was going to Pastor the church but I didn't actually know that he was running the cabinet company and and did some entrepreneurship that probably planted a seed somewhere in your brain um which we'll get to in a little while here but you know I'd love to I'd love to ask you man and do you have any memories of him when he was running the business you know we talk about in our world now how entrepreneurship is really difficult and we call it the most intense personal development program there is what do you remember from that do you remember him coming home after like a great day or a bad day or anything and just like you as a kid getting impacted by that uh 100% yeah it was it's wild my dad Not only was he you know had a family of seven but he would work Monday through Friday on the Cabinetry business and then on Saturdays he would spend all day in his bedroom studying and preparing for his sermon on Sundays and then Sunday mornings would work his second job I mean our family would you know we my mom ran the kids ministry my brothers and I ran the sound systems and uh our families cleaned their Church you know on Saturdays before the weekends like it was a full family effort to um serve the community in that way and um I think I grew up a lot seeing my dad in a leadership position it was very cool something I actually actively have to engineer now for my kids it was such a benefit for me to see my dad at work I could see him on Saturdays in the office all day and then on Sundays you know deliver the sermon and be there for our uh you know our community and then you know Cabinetry I'd see him bring home the or could go to his showroom we could see him go from drawing up plans on the kitchen table to them you know it was all custom Cabinetry so he has a whole workshop and these like heavy machinery that produces these like 150 500,000 kitchens like we're talking about the the stuff that is um it's not your average you know kitchen that you go to to Lowe's or Home Depot to go purchase and um it was cool seeing his the physical work pay off but uh there were there was a lot of times where like the family knew dad was real stressed there was a lot going on there whether it was you know employees that didn't show up or do their job or unhappy customers that had like super high unrealistic expectations or church families that you know had a family member passing away or dealing with some tough stuff like I got to see leadership demonstrated day in and day out the whole time growing up why I don't think that I Really Ever second guessed whether or not I would go into I never thought I would go into Ministry like I saw enough of that where I was like dude that's just not for me yeah um but the running the business and being in a leadership role and entrepreneurial role like I I just kind of felt like the default that that fit my my DNA and makeup because of how well I saw a modeled for my dad that's interesting would you did you bring any strategies from being a child in that family environment into your family environment now because I mean obviously our work isn't without stress um you know like what do you what did you carry forward from seeing your dad operate in that environment that you you know carry with you now I think a lot of it is communicating the why and trying to bring my my kids along for for hey why does Dad do this why does Dad have to you know it's it's it's an interesting thing at SAS Academy I have to figure out a way to explain to my kids what I do you know my my for my dad growing up I could it's really easy to see the kitchen it's really easy to see the sermon you know uh you know the way I've boil it down to my kids are are nine six and uh almost one and so I I say you know dad helps businesses make more money and serve their their customers right so I can be like okay you know my kids I have this this fun tradition when the kids are in school we call it liquor store Fridays we live like right near a liquor store so I walk them down it's not just a liquor store it's what they named it so just for the record it's like a convenience Mad Dog with the kids man just building memories yeah exactly you know Matt The Way We blow off team I just go grab my kids a couple of 40s we sit on the front porch and no no but um you know I tell them hey you know D would help helps companies like the liquor store figure out a way to to stock the right things and you know sell the right stuff and ultimately make money so it'll evolve over time but it is interesting working in like a tech world like me kids don't really understand what software is they kind of do but you know it takes a while for the lights to turn on there so um a lot of the times it's just around leadership principles um and um just sharing the why behind why do we work why do we wake up and and try to serve other people it's funny you say that man I'd never really thought about it you know the the difference in like the physical job that you can see but I I see it in my own home too right because my two oldest kids remember when I was still in the fire department so it went from Dad's a fireman to Dad talks to his friends on the computer which is usually how they describe that so yeah there's probably some work to be done there um expl that's super interesting um cool well so something that I would love to know because I I literally have no idea you know I've got a buddy who um played tripa baseball and so like you know I think that in in the world of pro sports the you know like baseball and football it's a relatively well-known Journey on like how you you know come up from playing college ball and you know so on and so forth but what's the Journey from you playing golf in college to you know somebody who gets on the PGA tour like what does that trajectory look like for somebody yeah there's there's a lot of different paths to it but the path that I was interested in taking and the one that I ultimately ended up pursuing was um you know you played college golf and at that point um you you just got to figure out for me I knew that I needed a little bit more time playing in some bigger tournaments like I had played in Collegiate tournaments but there's a whole amateur circuit and then there's you know you can once you've decided that you have performed well enough in amateur tournaments you can turn professional and now you start playing once you have a professional status you can't go back to playing amateur anymore and there's a few tournaments out there that allow you to for example in fact the US Open is going on right now the US Open is a tournament it's called the US Open because it's open to everywhere there'll be like local qualifiers and then Regional if do well there you qualify to go on to Regionals regionals you're qualify to go on and there'll be a handful of people either playing with professional status or amateur status at the US Open that'll have a field of 150 some people some of them have about a 100 will have their PGA Tour card there'll be another 50 people from all over the world and the United States that have qualified to play in the US Open so my plan was to move from North Carolina back out to California where there was a lot less weather uh to be concerned with it was golf wasn't a seasonal where I was at it was it was more seasonal and um start playing in some of those tournaments and really it just comes down to Performance like you if you start playing well in those tournaments it goes from college you're playing in two-day tournaments these you know uh Pro tournaments are three and four days long it's a totally different ball game there and what I did not um expect and came to F come to find out is the support that I had to play Collegiate golf like on our campus there was a indoor range there was a outdoor driving range there was two golf courses that I could play at with no expenses or anything I got deeply discounted equipment and apparel and all of that support and I had camarad where had 20 other people that were doing the same thing and so I'm AED to cross the country to live with my grandparents I lived within walking distance of two different golf courses um got a job at one and started playing and really it took me about like five to six months of you know of dedicating fulltime to trying to play professionally to realize that really what I loved about it what well I loved I loved actually playing golf but to do it as a job solo not with you know teammates I mean the game plan was I had a little trailer I was going to pull behind my car and I travel to golf tournaments live you know play for four days you get there on Tuesday you do a practice r on Wednesday you play Thursday to Sunday and you travel to the next tournament like that was going to be a whole lot of work that um just it was became clear that wasn't really how want to spend my life it's funny like I've I've moved a lot I've moved across the country a number of times um I've got a big healthy dose of respect for what that takes you moved from California to North Carolina as a kid with your family and then when you went to play golf you decided to move all the way back to California by yourself like what went into to that decision what what was that like for you yeah it was so I when I graduated I had one year left of Eligibility to play golf so I didn't play my freshman year so i' had actually gotten into the University of Tampa and had the opportunity to go down and play one more year um of golf there or I the other option I had was to pursue playing professionally in my mind at the time those were the two choices and if I was going to pursue playing professionally California is a lot better spot to be than than North Carolina was and so I also at that point had started to become familiar with the concept of student loans um and I was like I was on partial scholarship for golf but I was going to a private school so there was still racking up a decent amount of student debt and I was like well I don't really love school I really you know in in most scenarios I tell people that I major in golf because that's really all that I'm there to do so why don't I just go out to California and you know pursue pursue it there so I had just I'd had a Nissan Ultima at the time and I just worked all summer this was late August and I make the decision not to go to the University of Tampa and to move out to California instead so I just got my car out of the shop getting an engine replaced so at the time you know 1,600 bucks is a lot of money uh I work All Summer in a restaurant get the car fixed and I set out I load everything I have into the back of the Nissan Ultima and say goodbye to my immediate family and I only get about eight hours into the trip before my engine blows again so i' you know not not not one engine but now I'm burning through the second and I remember being on the side of the road in Nashville waiting for the tow truck to come and it's really the decision like I'm a lot closer to home than I am to California so I can go back to North Carolina and I knew what was waiting for me there but or I can rent a car transfer everything that I own from this Ultima into the back of a rental car and I can keep going and um at the time like I have 400 bucks in my bank account I'm putting everything else on a credit card beyond that and I just decided that there was something for me in California and I didn't know what it was at the time I thought it was maybe playing professionally but I just felt like I knew what you know I knew what history looked like I knew what the re premere had in store and I wanted to see what the rest of the road trip and my life in California would look like and turns out my entire my entire rest my I've been here for now 13 14 years I met my wife I got three kids like I'm I'm I remembered there's a few turning points and I think when anyone looks back over their life they can see a couple of moments when they're like hey I could have gone left or right and uh that was certainly one of those moments that had a pretty significant impact and so you get to California you think you're going to play pro golf you realize within what you said half a year or so that that's not the way and you end up um on the doorstep of a technology company called silvert track software as a if I remember correctly a commission only SDR sales development rep right basically the the low guy on the sales totem pole making outbound phone calls right like close for here so yeah um I move in August when you have student loans you have like six to I can't remember if it's six months or so it's somewhere around there before you actually have to start paying for them so at the time I'm just working at the golf course um I don't even have a car so I rent cars I get to my grandparents house I wake up every morning before the sun comes up I walk through the woods to the golf course I'm the first one there I open it up I pull all the golf carts out for the first few time to start rolling it I do that for about six months and in that time I meet and start dating Ashley who I go on to marry and I'm living with my grandparents and all at one time I start to get really serious about my future with Ashley my student loans start to kick in and I get kind of tired of living in my grandparents uh house without a car I'm like all right I need to make some more money and so I sit down and I WR out a list I asked myself like hey what would have to be true for me to marry Ashley and like start a life with her and at the top of that list I'm like I would need to find a job that would pay me me $2,000 a month like I'm GNA at least need that pretty high bar right so um I make that list one night in in the living room the very next night my grandpa has for years he's owned and ran a security company so providing Guard Services to the Central Coast where we lived and that night he just so happens to be meeting with the person who was operating that company he had since retired and goes to dinner with them and they say hey we're looking they tell my grandpa I think we're gonna hire someone in a business development and marketing help us improve our sales and he comes home and he asks me hey Johnny would you w to work for bowar security it's gonna pay $2,000 a month and you'd be doing sales marketing and I'm like sold so I literally write it down one night the very next time my grand I don't tell my grandpa grandpa comes home hey what do you think about doing this job I'm like I'll take it sounds like a great fit um so I started working with Bart and two months in I'm asking myself how do I differentiate our services like everyone does the same thing it's an hourly guard out there and I end up finding this software solution called Silver trck and I become a customer of that product and it helps us completely differentiate what our services are right so every other guard company is out there handwriting reports and they can say anything they're typically working overnight with no supervision so they're at a Hospital they're at a school they're at a construction site whatever and there's no management there the security is there because there's no one else at the property and the guard is writing a report saying what happened that night and then giving it to the manager so it's really easy for a guard to just like write up whatever they want slip the report under the manager's door go home and not actually be there for the night all the time you'd find Guard Services like the stereotypes are real of the security guard sleeping or them being the person that actually steals from the property whatever it is so silver track is this ability for us to completely differentiate our service offering and it start to sell a ton of Security Services to the point where that the manager and my grandparents like hey Johnny we're not really interested in expanding to multiple locations and you know we kind of like the lifestyle business that we got and I was I was like a bull in in a china shop in that company and so I started to have an idea of technology that I would build for the security industry because of how Revolution silver track was for us and I called the founder of silver track to ask for advice I'm like who do I know that could help you know share some advice on building tech for the security industry and Chris was the person I thought of so I called him he's like hey really cool idea why don't you drive down to Seal Beach and I'll tell you what we're working on and I'll give you you know give you you know spend the morning talking about that in the afternoon we'll dive deep on your your idea and so it's about three and a half hour drive I'm like sweet I'll be there on Friday and I drove down and come to find out I thought Silver track was this like wellestablished product and turns out it was just they had built it to serve their own security company and had just been early in spinning it out to the point where he was recruiting 10 to 12 guys that would sell it commission only he said hey I'll give you 30% of the revenue but you sell it support it train your customers I just give you 30% of the recuring revenue so essentially I'm I'd be a reseller of the product and I'm like well I like your idea a lot better than like yeah and U so I start with him as a Trade Commission sales rep you know one month later we went from 10 guys I was the only one left and um I was doing I built my own marketing site you know uh s sold it supported it trained our customers and um yeah that's how I got my start into into Tech so you were reselling it it was a reseller yeah was basic the the way he positioned it to me was hey you're going to get commission only sales but then it was all month-to-month contracts and I only got 30% of what they paid so I'm like well that also means I'm going to support it and then also means I need to train them because if I just sell it and they don't know how to use it that commission goes away so it was really like would have been better positioned as a reseller but yeah that is exactly what it was and so how did how did the journey go from that I mean gosh you're basically a solution partner like how did it go from that to you were running before you became the CEO of that company spoil alert right you were running customer success I think for for a hot minute there right like how did you go from outside to inside yes so it was always a really small company so it just is like hey Johnny what's your title I don't know pick whatever you think is makes the most sense so I felt like best all-encompassing would be call me customer success but essentially for three years I sell and support the software to the point where I've built up a book of business way bigger than the company had like I have all of our customers 80% of them and so they're like well you could and I'm making 30% so I'm getting 30% of our essentially our Topline Revenue as a company and they're like hey you know we think it's time for us to grow up as a company like why don't we you know make it to where you are an employee we'll give you a spased salary we'll give you health insurance like the whole time it's just straight commission Top Line I'm like my own uh contractor and of course I'm collaborating with the founders we talk about what features need to be built whatever we're acting like a a a company together but I'm not on paper you know an employee and so we decid to like renegotiate how I'm compensated and they bring me on as their first employee and the title I pick in that is hey call me the VP a customer success that'll let me have great sales conversations but also let our customers know that I'm not just there to sell them I'm there to support and um yeah that's interesting as somebody who loves deconstructing negotiations I got to say you put yourself in a really solid uh solid position to have that conversation I can imagine that's pretty wild um yeah so you you come in and and you end up being the CEO and then ceoing it through an acquisition so you know I would love to I don't want to skip too far ahead but like what was the biggest lesson you learned ceoing this first company yeah it was really interesting again their titles were not a huge point of emphasis right so on the way the business ran and operated on a daily basis like everyone inside the walls and outside the walls anyone that dealt with us knew that I was running the company but it was never like this moment where it says hey Johnny you are the CEO of the company right um and so a lot of it was the responsibility and weight of running the company without the the the shortcut or the proxy that that title would give um and so I think it helped build a muscle in in me of hey leadership doesn't require a title um show up every day as if you own the company for seven years I acted like I was an owner on the cap table and um there's a ton of lessons out of that like call an entrepreneurial journey of thinking and acting like you're the owner of the company and it led to a ton of good one of the things that I um you know regret about that time was underestimating the the power of having a well-rounded negotiation getting clear on what I really wanted and I actually never got onto the cap table right so the story of how we exited that company was was pretty interesting there's three founders one responsible for the product the develop elment one responsible for support and one responsible for the front of the house the the sales and the marketing side um that was kind of how they when they all like kind of you know worked together of hey how are things going and again there would be like months or years would go by where they don't really talk to each other that much like this is not function like a this was a they're all related right they're two brothers and a cousin they ran a security company built a cool product like it was absolutely a lifestyle business for two out of the three um for myself and Chris this was something that we saw a ton of potential in it built a great business around it like at that point we're probably doing about three million in annual revenue and it's much bigger than any of them thought that it would ever be um and Chris and I the market starts to heat up there's becomes more and more competitors and we say look we have to figure out a way to continue to innovate and evolve the product and uh Troy our the the co-founder responsible for product was I will never manage any employees I will never have someone on my team so he did Android mobile application Apple application he hosted all of our own data all the data security and all of the development one guy and we got to point was like all right this is this is we need to figure out a way to buy him out so we spent six months like evaluating all of our options to do that didn't um you know nothing really sat right they weren't really interested in having debt and uh turned over that stone that didn't work out and then eventually decided that the best way forward for the company was to go through an acquisition and so I start you know fielding all conversations with all of those emails prospecting sourcing emails that we gotten from private equity and um you know uh interested parties over the years I just start to field them and uh we go through about a yearlong process of evaluating then getting a letter of intent working through due diligence and um getting the company sold but um ton of Lessons Learned the one that I will youo to give that a that chapter of my life a headline um it would be just like index on learning um I did get advice around hey before you go get the company valued make sure you get on the cap table if you want you're gonna go sell this thing and you want something out of it as soon as they know what the company's worth that ship will have sailed I did not take that advice I trusted that hey this was you know I don't need to be on the cap table for them to take care of me they're well aware of the role that I've played in this whole thing um in hindsight I wish I would have yeah um and uh but yeah took all that I learned in that scenario to uh get the company sold created lifechanging uh Financial outcome for the three founders and um you know sold it just north of 20 million uh and uh uh yeah took those learnings onto the rollup company did about 18 months with them and then eventually that led me to ask Academy but that's wild man but your journey with SAS Academy didn't start as the coming in as a team member right so I mean you were running silver track and this is when we first met you were running silver track and like what was the Catalyst when you were in that role to reach out for coaching because you became a client of SAS Academy first like what made you seek help outside the building I saw a ton of ads from Dan Martell if you want the real truth about it like so many YouTube videos and then I got ads and like I just figured I'd take 15minute phone call with this guy like I I wasn't seeking coaching I didn't even know there something like this existed like I had no no idea that you could hire a coach to help you I mean aside from golf I'd never taken those lessons and applied them in business I read a ton of books I used to watch a lot of YouTube videos but the thought of ever like hiring a business coach never crossed my mind um Dan was the first person I talked to that offered anything like that and I remember very vividly my sales call with him and fortunately did a great job he did a great job overcoming some objections as you know we would go on to find out he can be a very uh compelling and uh charismatic guy and I figure this guy sounds like he knows a lot about growing a software company and um let me see if I can you know uh make it work to get in the program and see how that goes and I had no idea what I to expect but I it was another one of those in in hindsight had I just you know schluff that off as a sales call and said I'll think about it like my life would be on a very different trajectory now so 2017 I joined 2019 we exited so it's about two and a half years in the program um and a lot of the momentum that we gathered to you know get us ready and and in a position where it could be an exciting Financial outcome for the founders came from a lot of what we learned in SAS Academy and then certainly the guidance to I mean like I had never I had no idea that there was even a due diligence period like to be in a group full of people to understand how do business Acquisitions work what should I value what should we protect against what's an asset sale versus a stock sale like there's so much that went into um you know that process SAS Academy became very helpful resource um as we navigated through it it's interesting because we draw a lot of parallels in our own conversations about Athletics versus business right we've used you know a lot of people use the term corporate athlete nowadays and we talk about you know coaching and it's similar to you know getting coaching in a sports environment so given your background on golf it's interesting that you hadn't considered that like what was your what was your biggest objection or your biggest hang up you know like when you when you said you got in that call and you didn't know what to expect but you talk to this guy named Dan who has a tendency to be somewhat convincing when he has something to say like what what was the biggest objection that you think Dan the sales guy had to overcome to get you to see the value in hiring a coach um it was two things one I had all of my eggs any discretionary um I guess like money that we were putting back into the business I was spending all of it at the time working with the marketing agency we had worked with a couple of like amateur agencies and it really felt like you know for us to get the most out of our marketing efforts we needed to work with a a more well-known established reputable agency and so at the time I was spending about 10K per month with an agency and it was a matter of like if we were going to go work with SAS Academy I would need to significantly reduce our involvement with uh the agency or just St working them all together and uh and work with with Dan so he uh he was I and I brought that up with him I'm like hey at the end of the call he's like hey what do you want to do and I said well I'm g go try to get our partners on board and hopefully I'm able to get out of a contract with our agency and he said try and hope aren't strategies what are you going to do and I said I'm going to get our partners on on board and I'm gonna let go over marketing agency and he was like perfect what card would you like to use and I gave him gra him the credit card and then made you know got those two parties or those boxes checked but that was it I mean really it was I was fairly certain even after all the content that uh consumed and then the conversation had with with Dan that this was at minimum it was not going to make us go backwards and had a lot of potential to go forward so and that had already been working with the agency long enough to know that there was no magic bullet I couldn't just like Outsource this part of the um the business and Dan was like look anything the agency's doing for you I can teach you how to do even better so you know put that money here and invest the rest into you know hiring support to execute which is what we ended up doing but um yeah it was more so driving to a conclusion instead of keeping it something like I don't know I'll think about it yeah yeah yeah you figure if you can if you can close your prospects half as well as he just closed you on that call you'll probably be all right at the end of the day huh yeah 100% yep y that's funny man and so like I remember when we first met because you know for people listening like where silver track's offices were and where Johnny lives I actually used to live like 10 minutes away from there as a kid so I remember we were in gosh it was probably I think Toronto maybe in 2018 when we first met um and talking about that and you know we had a similar trajectory because we ended up selling our businesses like two weeks apart you know I think you were the very end of 2019 I was very beginning of 2020 um and so you're working with Track Force the company that bought silver track for about a year and a half how did you end up back at SAS Academy I mean I know all roads kind of lead to den but like what was that like you know you're working a track Force how did it shake yeah yeah so we we get through the ACT acquisition and sometime after that I have a phone call with d I'm like hey man I don't know that I can continue to be involved in SAS Academy the same way like I need to they're going to look at the the financials on everything we're spending money on like our our renewal dates coming up pretty soon like I I just I don't think that it's going to apply anymore I'm not the CEO of the company anymore so I'll probably wind down our relationship he says hey well what would have to be true for us to keep working together and I'm like man I think that if anything less than 750 bucks a month probably doesn't get as much uh like attention from their Financial team so like I could justify and make a case for us staying involved you got a lot of training and resources it supports our team like 750 a month Keeps Us involved he's like perfect let's do that so that keeps us in engaged you know coming to events throughout that process and you know about six months go by and every every three to six months like Dan's you know just give me a call hey how are things going like what do you learning what are you excited about and just kind of nurturing a conversation too about maybe six months post acquisition he says tell want you coach in SAS Academy we'll just do you know for clients that need help in an area that you're an expert in we'll set you up on a 30 minute call we'll pay you for those 30 minutes like why you join as and be one of our coaches and I loved that at first and and probably another you know six months go by and I'm doing some coaching calls and I ended up like telling him and Kelsey at the time who was leading our our coaching team I'm like I really love this but I love it to a point where I want to be great at it and I can't be great at it doing halfway like I'm an obsessive all-in kind of person and I feel like I'm doing a really shitty job compared to what IID want to do and so that me stopping coaching but saying this is something I'd want to do really well at that increased the Cadence of which Dan and I were talking like it was probably every you know maybe month to two months he'd call me up and just ask hey what's going on and we just were that was a searching of how could we work together right um and so I I can't remember where in the timeline it was actually it's probably around January February 2021 we he starts asking like wait what would it look like for you to come over and run our customer success team and I went through the full process I didn't record a one minute video I did take a predictive index and I um did a test project presentation I remember it was funny they asked me to lay out a plan to do a test project presentation they give 30 minutes to present it and I took 29 minutes and 49 seconds from like the moment that we get on the call I present the whole plan there was no feedback I three people on no back and forth they're like hey Johnny this was great we've got to run to another call we'll let you know how it goes and I'm like sweet I either absolutely crushed this thing or I absolutely bombed it and then you know the next phone call a couple hours later was Dan saying hey want you get you on the team and started working through um what it would look like but it was a it was a big leap to leave Track Force like I had not had any equity in silver track but as a acknowledgement for the work that I done it had a pretty exciting like at the time it felt like um stock option like and compensation package with Track Force and so I remember just having a conversation with Dan being like dude if I if I leave this company like I got to know that I have a path to being a partner like the next thing I work on I won't make I got you know seven at this point eight years into the security industry if I'm GNA leave and focus on software I need this chapter to include a c at the table I need to have equity in the company and um you know he it wasn't something we negotiated and finalized then but he said look you know I like to crawl before we walk and walk before we run like come in you deliver what I think you can deliver just know that I can make your world a whole lot bigger and that'll include Equity that'll include lots of different things and um I had known and work with Dan for long enough to know that if I held up my end and did what I thought I could do um that he would fulfill his end of the commitment and um yeah decided to make the leap April 2021 actually I sold the rental property and I remember telling my wife like I don't this makes no sense on paper like um but I can't keep on waking up every day and working in the security industry and I can't keep working out you know working in private Equity I need to go do something that makes me excited like I'm not the dad I can be the husband I can be the human I can be because I'm not I'm just done with this chapter of My Life um so are you okay with me taking the risk like um and she I remember her saying it's more than any money in the bank what I really care about is that when you were done working it was a day well spent that you are happy and excited I've seen you when you are in that mode and I've seen you when you're not like I don't care what it costs go do the thing that you you want to do and um I remember exactly where I was sitting when she said that and I was like all right that's all that needed like yeah I um if it's the consequences are only on me then I'll like I'll swing for the fences every time when it has my wife and my kids and family it's like a totally different level of responsibility and consideration and so to get her blessing in that and um you know in Dan's commitment that uh we are on the same page of my expectations was all I needed to to make the leap over it's crazy man it's like until you've had it I don't think people have an appreciation for the true value of a partner like that in life man you know I mean I've had similar like inflection points with you know my own um career with my wife and it just your point right it's like it makes you just pause for a second and be like damn you know if Ash may have shown up to that conversation in a different head space that one day it could have changed the trajectory of your entire career for your entire life you know 100% dude that's awesome I hope she listens to this um yeah that's really cool it's fun they the I a family value of ours we say Pages choose adventure and we say it all the time but then I'll take moments when we feel this it is and the way I'll explain this to my kids it's choosing the path unknown versus the path known yeah okay so like hey we know what what it's like if we decide to stay at home and watch a movie tonight but we don't know what it's like if we decide to go check out a new spot CH Pages choose adventure and I know what it's like if we decide to stay in this home and instead we go purchase a new one like let's go pages are going to choose adventure let's choose a path unknown and sometimes it will be awesome and we'll be so thankful we did and sometimes it won't be and we'll be like oh my gosh why we do that but it's the adventure the unknown that is that we value and so I love like my wife and I are equally uh interested in living out that value of P just choose adventure let's go let's go do the new thing and at the end of it it either works out or we get a better us as cons priz winner we learn right yeah 100% so you come into SAS Academy and you were I think you joined about a year before I did and you know I think anytime somebody takes a new position you have that moment where you realize that maybe the world you stepped into is going to require something different than what you thought you were stepping into and so I can only guess you probably had that moment like what was that that moment for you you know there's a lot of benefit that we get at SAS Academy from thinking and operating like a software company but there is a massive difference between delivering customer success against a product a software tool and delivering customer success coaching businesses and I did not properly understand the difference between the two I fig figured it out pretty quickly and recognized that it was going to be where in software you have the benefit and from my background silver track was what you call a system of record the entire business operation once we got them through onboarding was wrapped around silver track so the switching costs were extremely high the adoption rate and uh utilization rate was very high the whole business ran through silver track um and so once we got the business in like I mean there are still clients today some of my very first clients at Silver Trek are still using the product today almost a decade later and coaching is not like that every single month you have to win the heart and mind of your customer and build confidence and and ultimately deliver Roi to the business and if business was easy everyone would be successful the reality is you know there's so many variables that make it harder to deliver customer success in that it's the founders mindset the business and the industry that they've chosen the team that they've hired and the strategies that they choose to deploy we can help influence all of them but in a lot of ways we're working through the founder in the business and um man that the difference there it's been one when I recognized it I was like holy this is a lot different I can run from it or run to it um running to it will teach me if I can do customer success in this industry holy hell I ever go back to software it'll feel like a piece of cake I mean to go back to a system of record where the product will perform like you expect it to every single day like our product is people and the way that they relate to our Founders and the way that they help communicate I mean there's so many more complexities around delivering coaching as a product that's probably the biggest one where even still today you can hear the like the excitement and the challenge in you know us thinking about how do we scale a coaching company um and make sure that we working customer backwards and and delivering great results for our clients like that is by far the biggest difference between what I thought I was getting myself into and what it actually you know what it was what do you think the uh the first test was that Dan threw at you I know he didn't tell you it was a test um because then it's not as fun but what do you think was the first test he threw at you to see if you could eventually handle being the CEO of the company you know there's something to and I've I've coached many people through this Dan has a lot of different businesses and partners and people that he works well with and I think that how I naturally do things really lends itself well to working with Dan so I think very early on um Dan knew that and could feel that in our working relationship that I was someone that we could build with through the highs and the lows um and all the in between that we were could work really well together um because I always I came in and acted like it was my own like if Dan thought no matter how passionately Dan would communicate a direction or an idea like I had an opinion on where we would go and sometimes it lined up and when it didn't like I would tell him and I would act like it was on me to make sure that we made the right decision um whether I was the one that owned the company or not so I think that that really built trust with Dan early on I mean I can remember you know probably three months into mebe leading customer success we make a higher in marketing and to lead our marketing department and you know two months into that person being on the team it became clear that we had not made the right decision and so I said hey Dan like I'm pretty sure I can handle the marketing team at customer success like why don't you let me take that on as well and that that moment and then the execution that came after that and then many other moments where we like made leadership hires and I just like slowly you know increased my responsibility and so when it came time to say okay well hey can Johnny be the CEO like we at this point we've already got two years of experience under our belt together saying so this is such a from the outside it looks like a big step up in responsibility but if you could have watched how Dan and I operated together and you did you saw many of it along like there never was there was not a huge Delta Johnny was acting like a CEO from the moment he stepped into the business as a vpa customer success like there was not a I was always interested in in that way so there was some like you know the technical components of our financial reviews and um you know checks and balances in that area there's some like you know tactical stuff but of the can Johnny H can he deal can we you know can our our relationship evolve into one of like a you know an owner and a CEO from a CEO to a an executive it wasn't that far of a leap um inside the building as it looked outside the building dude totally so you've done this twice right you came into silver track you built a book of business that eclipsed the size of the entire company took over a VP role took over as CEO came into SAS Academy as a part-time coach took over one Department took over two departments became the chief Revenue officer became the CEO you know I don't know really anybody that I look to more than I look to you to live out the example of what it means to be an entrepreneur and I know you do a lot of content around entrepreneurship it seems like that was the journey your dad took also like you had mentioned earlier taking over the cabinet company right so it's U planted your brain from an early age if you had to Define entrepreneurship is it as simple as just taking over a company from from an employee role or like how would you explain it to someone well I say all the time like leadership happens with or without a title so at the end of the day you show up like a leader and sometimes that'll give you the capacity and the skill set to lead a single department and sometimes you'll continue to grow your leadership capacity and skills to lead multiple departments and be an executive but the first thing is recognizing that leadership is needed in every single organization like no matter what every problem that we have in society it is being solved to the level of leadership that exists and so if you can increase your level of leadership you will solve more problems you will create more value and so I just like I you know commit whole heartedly to no matter where I'm at like I'm on the the board of our kids soccer league and our soccer league will improve to the degree of the leaders that are involved and so you know I come in and whether I'm the I don't know what it is a president or I'm you know managing our equipment or I'm just a volunteer the more that I lead the more naturally the more responsibility that will come my way now do I want it or not that's a whole different story but leadership's needed in every single Arena and so what is entrepreneurship it's assuming like I had someone tell me one time they said said don't act like this is a hotel act like it is your home when you're in a hotel someone else comes in and cleans up after you when you're at home you clean up the mess it's all your mess and so treat this like a home and I treat every business like it's my home I don't act like someone else is going to come in and clean up after me and so if you just Ste it down to the nucleus there's a lot of ways that I help coach people through expressing entrepreneurship and building the skill sets and the mindsets and even charting the Journey of like where should you start if you wantan to if you want to be take the entrepreneurial journey I think it you know makes sense to start with the customer first start as close as you can to them then makes it easier to take over sales and take over marketing you got to know the product you got to know the problem you're solving you got to know your customer deeply but at the all at the end of all of it it's like comes down to you know leadership capacity and and your skill set and you act like your home you will find yourself uh either having to turn down the promotions or being promoted dude I love that and you know you hit on something that I jotted down to bring up but I would imagine if you're the only if you're the kind of person like you are that only goes all in on things right and I know that to be pretty true from our experience together it probably can create some overc commitment issues right like I feel like you've got to be really diligent on what you say no to so you're not you know focusing really hard on being the best damn equipment manager that your kids soccer league ever had at the expense of a different opportunity that might be more exciting right have you uh you ever had one of those situations where you look back and you wish you said no to something you said yes to because it's taken too much out of you all the time all the time in fact I wrote a letter to my wife a while ago there was we had a a really challenging and and Rocky part of our relationship and I said you know what why don't we both write down what we want out of life and out of a relationship and part of that is taking into account who am I and what are the parts of me that I'm willing to change and and want to change in order to have a fulfilling relationship and what are the parts that are going to be constant throughout our our life because it's how I want to live life and there were many of those things but one of them was I like to live life on the edge I will always find myself in a position where I've overcommitted and I have to reel it back I'll oscillate through that over the course of a year I like finding the edge I'm naturally restless and I will choose adventure so um yeah often times it's ready fire aim yeah um and then just get you know and I'm try to be more diligent about it there's times when there's like consequences to it and there's times where there's not it's like for example I spent a season sitting on the sidelines watching my kids be coached by someone else and I was like you know what I have too much of an opinion I'm going to at least assistant coach like I want to be out there and if I'm going to say something something it should might as well be like within the what is considered acceptable instead of a parent be that Dad chirping from the sideline right yes I'm like at least I'm gon I'm GNA go get the certifications I'm gonna spend the time I'll be there all the practices like you know so you know where I think if I have an opinion about how something should run I also have a responsibility to vocalize that and to help fulfill it and so I had too much of an opinion on what the the value that Sports has in my kids life for me to decide that I was just going to like come bring my kids to practice and sit there and watch and so um but it's it's natural I told my wife again that letter I'm like I will we will have to have this Rhythm to our relationship that says hey Johnny we might have overcommitted here and for us to do that in a way that's healing to the relationship versus like me doing it to her and if we can do that heck yeah but this will be a part of me I will do this I want to find and I want to maximize potential and just part of that is you got to go find how do you build capacity you have to stress the system I want a lot out of my life I have in every area of life I want to live a 10 out of 10 and so what does that mean sometimes I'm gonna to the 11 or the 12 and I only got to eight and how does Johnny have the capacity for more I got to go through some hard stuff and as long as we can have the release valve in our relationship where that becomes a part of what we experience together and something that we enjoy and look forward to um then we're going to have a health and fruitful relationship if it's something that's like she can't stand then we probably got to figure out a way to to par ways and um luckily she's down for the adventure so we're still together and but yeah I overcommit quite frequently yeah no doubt man um that's a cool share about the letters man I appreciate you sharing that it's uh it's an an area we don't get to too often on this podcast so I think it's super cool I want to leave you with this man I want to leave you with one final question um for this episode and I'm going to leave it super open-ended what is Johnny paage excited about right now well on the on the I I'll enter in a couple different Arenas okay so on the professional front I'm excited about the The Challenge and the impact created by scaling a coaching company um the cool part I mentioned earlier it's challenging on the customer success side um because you don't have a product but the cool part is with the muscle that makes you build is I have to be able to attract and Lead really incredible people yeah like it it all comes down to that and so I love the challenge like who that will make me and the byproduct that that will have on our team and our clients I love that challenge um so I'm excited about the progress that we're making in that area and you know the the changes that it's forcing and creating in me um I'm excited about the work that we're doing for our clients like I it's never I don't never get desensitized to it I mean every Wednesday and Friday we ask our coaches to post the wins in their challenges and every Wednesday they tell us about another customer that's increased their revenue that has hired their first assistant that has hired their first sales rep that's landed a big Enterprise deal that got past a plateau that they'd been at for 10 plus years and I just never get used to it I always remember and feel the founder surrounded by their family and by the people who like they had this Vision deep inside them and for years had to live in between the gap of them seeing it and no one else seeing it and now finally someone else gets to see it and they get the satisfaction of holy man I never thought you'd make it but you're making it you're making it happen so they just it never I'm always excited about that I don't ever get desensitized to it whether we scale this thing to coach thousands and thousands of clients or we continue coaching you know the hundreds that we have right now like the one still super exciting and important to me um and then on the personal front I just moved my family into a uh a new home where we've got a little bit more land my wife is excited about um not fully homesteading but she's looking forward to having some room for some animals and some planters and I even was on a tractor the other day which was hilarious my family was just getting a huge kick out of me and some like Converse and some jeans riding around in a freaking I didn't have that were you wearing your polo shirt on the tractor was it like full Johnny pagee tractor mode or what it was a full yeah it was it was to the point where so the homeowners that we bought the home from the house came with a tractor and uh they were showing me around it and the the neighbors and my family were all like what is happening right now Johnny's driving a tractor something this photo doesn't fit yeah yeah I didn't have that in my bingo card it must have been Photoshop or something man it's crazy yeah so get to go out and um you know new stage it's fun last night my wife and I were watching the sunset over our new view and the kids were playing around in the yard like running with a little bit more space we were kind of in a little bit smaller spot before and it just felt like a fun New Chapter expanding and um with that comes a lot more responsibility a lot more work to go put into the the property and
