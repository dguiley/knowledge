## Not Extracted (Lower Priority)

These themes appeared but weren't distinct enough for separate artifacts:
- Underdog advantage (covered in time-horizon)
- Leverage types (4 types) - could be future fact
- Moat types (5 types) - could be future fact
- Lead generation tactics (tactical, source-specific)
- Door-to-door sales specifics (tactical)
