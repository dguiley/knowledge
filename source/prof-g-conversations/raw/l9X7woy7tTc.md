if we could distill it down to one skill that could really change the course of human relationships it would be people learning to listen differently to other [Music] people Julian Elizabeth where does this podcast find you we are in New York City on a snowy slushy morning so first off good to see you guys we last met uh we were in my we had coffee at my place in SoHo which was lovely was lovely was that about two years ago when was that about a year ago actually was about a year ago okay so before we get into peop soft I want to talk about Soul cycle which I imagine you have no desire to talk about but I think it's interesting give us the backstory on on when you guys started Soul cycle yeah look Elizabeth and I had um both moved to New York from a city where exercise was lifestyle an idea that did not yet exist in New York City where we all went to Big Box gyms and we burned calories and we competed with the person next to us but we did not yet think of exercise as Community as joyful as something we did to release stress and sort of improve our mental health as well as our physical health and um we were two people in New York looking for that and we were taking classes with the same instructor at different gyms and she introduced the two of us and the next thing you know we had this idea for soul cycle and you know I like to take you back to a time when there was no Lululemon yet in New York and Instagram it was really at the time a very novel concept to think about how exercising and an exercise Community could feel aspirational and inspirational so just sort of the the top line of inception to exit how long was it 10 years 10 years yeah I've always said it takes about usually it takes about a decade if a company is really successful people don't realize how long it takes it probably feels fast but and what in your mind when you said we have a vision for something and it needs to be more than a room with with stationary bikes when you describe the core of it like the real value proposition what is it you know I think it was there were there were sort of few pieces into it one was the instructors that we were taking were so tired because the gyms this was the this was not a profit Center this is where they were spending money and so we thought if we could invert the model and create real careers for Fitness professionals so that they could have full-time heal health insurance and they could have a lot of perks that we thought they deserved and they could really focus their energy in bringing a great experience to the room that everybody would feel that so that was sort of one aspect the second was Hospitality we had rented a space that we found on Craigslist that had no sign at all and so by the time somebody reached us down a long hallway we were so thrilled to see them that we really wanted to feel like they mattered cuz they it did it really mattered to us that they had shown up and the reality was that it created these seeds of hospitality not only in each of us but in everybody who kind of you know work not only worked for us but who walked through the door and then just laying and Technology where it made it easy for people to join these classes previously you'd have to show up to your gym an hour early to sign up on a piece of paper to a very popular class and in this way you could plan your week and you could fold Fitness into your lifestyle what what in your mind I mean I think there's orange theory I'm actually an investor in CrossFit uh you guys arguably I would argue built the strongest brand I don't know about the Enterprise Value or whatever but I would argue bet the singular brand aspirational brand I remember my sister coming to New York and greatest city in the world and the only thing they had planned was all of them had scheduled Soul cycle classes every day and I thought my God this brand is stronger than you know Broadway at this point you come to New York and everybody wherever they go they're planning their their trip around Soul cycle what part of the execution do you think you got right that others didn't get right well first of all I'd like i' I'd actually like to backtrack and say that you know we kind of built the category um of Fitness as Community right so of course there's been Fitness for a long time but I do think that we reimagine it in a way that was experiential and I do think that all the crossfits and all the others sort of fell in line behind that and listen we're thrilled about it I mean we we continue to say that you know our purpose on this planet is to be Community Builders and honestly we build things that we ourselves need and we ourselves use and I think at the time we were two people that were looking for joy and community Through exercise and that was always the thesis around it but what did you did better was it hiring and retaining the best instructors picking the best real estate little touch points what if you were to pick one thing that you did better than everybody else what was it we invested in people that is it ac across the entire spectrum of our business from the instructors who we made a home for and turned into ambassadors and paid better than they'd been paid before to our front desk employees who we invested in training we invested in hearing them we invested in knowing them we invested in them knowing each other and turn they knew our customers we invested in our customers when they when they had things to say we listened we made changes according to their their insights in our business we all worked at the front desk so we got to knew each other for a very long time and at the end of it you know I think that this is sort of extremely relevant to what we're doing today but you know people people always ask us that about About Soul cycle and I can remember people always walking through the doors thinking H it would be so easy to recr create this business all the businesses that came into our space and thought well I put a bunch of equipment in the room and I get a bunch of people doing this thing then it'll be you know 50 bikes or 50 barbells or 50 rowing machine times 35 bucks a person and there you have it and the truth is it wasn't about that at all and training people takes a lot of time investing in people takes a lot of money it's a lot more labor intensive than people like to give it credit for I think that people especially these days are looking at the digital products we create thinking about how complex they are when the truth is that treating people well is is is more complex if not as complex as doing something like that so let's talk a little bit about peoplehood give us the the elevator pitch on peoplehood because I don't think most people know it sure I mean it is really um you know we're calling it relational Fitness and and I will say listening to you know all of um your amazing work and writings and podcasts you know it's really a new category as we're thinking about it and thinking about you know why is it that people understand that you know in order to have a healthy body you need to move a few times a week in order to have mental health you need to talk or see somebody or a therapist once a week um and yet there is this idea around relationships that they will just work out people prioritizing their relationships or thinking about them as a practice or a priority or something that needs intentional time around it seems to not yet really be in the Zeitgeist and so peoplehood is really the practice of being in relationships with other people we've created an experience not unlike Soul cycle which is a 60-minute guided conversation practice and spoiler alert um and a lot of what you talk about which which we find so interesting is you know we're teaching people to listen that is if we could distill it down to one skill that could really change the course of human relationships it would be people learning to listen differently to other people and Elizabeth what's is the business model similar to Soul cycle where it's my understanding of Soul cycle was it's not membership it was per usage but maybe I'm not as familiar with it what's the business model and who is the core customer who generally speaking what's the demographic or the psychographic or the person that is drawn to peoplehood you know it's so it I just want to go back to one thing which is like I really think and I think Julie this is one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you is that the combination of physical health and relational Health that to me is like we are seeing across all of the research that is coming out that those two things s really sit at the center of us being able to lead the kind of lives that we say that we want to lead and there's so much conversation around what the problem is and there just are not that many solutions and so we really have this desire to get as many people as we can into facilitated conversations with one another whether it is individuals coming to just be present with other people sometimes it's easier to talk to strangers than people that you already know to address like every couple talks about how their relationship becomes a logistics meeting after a while and we want to be able to give the scaffolding and the structure for people to be able to engage with each other in a way that is Meaningful and actually leaves you feeling better than when you started and you just do for 1 hour so it's not a heavy lift and then additionally when you think about like what's happening at work one of the things that we both loved About Soul cycle is we woke up in the morning and we were so excited to go to work the idea that you can have that kind of camaraderie in your in the way place that you spend all of your time like in your place of business that means so much to us and even pre pandemic we were thinking about this because how do you create these kinds of opportunities for collisions where you really get to know the people that you work with in a different way that you know each other as humans so that you just have that much more propensity toward collaboration and toward really working together and getting through the tough stuff together and so the model itself is based on we we do paper class and we do uh membership I think that what we are really really interested in more than anything else the headline is just getting people into facilitated conversations with each other so that they can connect because the chemistry around this is so old I mean just think about like how we evolved and yet we are sorely missing this kind of activity and there's no place to put it and Julie how do you create the Alchemy for a good guided conversation is the guide there to just do they understand the semantics and the the the ingredients of a good conversation or are they meant to be a domain expert the guide is really there to create this scaffolding uh I think that so much of what happens in our conversations with each other is you know one person sucks the air out of the room of course we all know that people you know think that they're going to leave the best impression in a conversation to give advice give their opinion you know try to connect I mean that's all of our Instinct right you you tell me about your experience and rather than me validating you I tell you about my experience because I think what's going to happen there is you and I are going to have something in common but ultimately most times you would have felt better about our interaction if I had listened and just validated what I heard from you and so the guides are really there to create this structure that allows Equity of time that allows Equity of thought you know allows people to really recognize themselves and others and more than more than actually trying to create the way that the conversation goes they just keep things on the rails so that people can come back and continue to practice this idea of you can share and I can listen and I can share and you can listen you know we do a lot of active listening without reacting in the room and it sounds simple and people come and say when just going to listen and then people can't help themselves right they have to put their opinion in or give their advice or you should or I did and they come out of these rooms and say gosh that was so hard and in the same way that we would never go for one run and think hey I'm ready for a marathon practicing this kind of listening over and over again is something that will really never get old and so the guides also they share their own life experiences which really allows and permissions the room and people in the room or the screen to feel comfortable they create trust they create an environment where you know telling us your experience which is of course kept confidentially in those conversations feels like the norm feels okay feels like you won't be judged feels safe and Elizabeth when I think I think of this as a retail concept and I think the most successful retail concepts are generally in the business of addiction and that is uh Starbucks is an addiction uh Chipotle is an addiction I'm addicted to survival and the salt that's in the you know the sustenance in the salt um uh CrossFit for me is an addiction the norepinephrine the high I get I'm literally addicted to and if I don't get it I start that withdraws and get upset and depressed how do you get people because at the end of the day I would imagine I don't know if it's a G20 rule but at all of these Concepts I would imagine at Soul cycle you're not making they you weren't making bank off the folks coming once every 3 months you're making bank off the the addicts who are there a lot how do you turn this into something that people want to use multiple times you know I think one of the models that we looked at was AA and we really asked ourselves like why just thinking that yeah why do we need to be bottoming out to be in the company of others and I just we just really believe I mean for ourselves like there is a genuine thirst for this kind of activity and you feel higher when you leave so the repetition of it and the notion that this is a practice is something that we are putting into the zeit guys so that we can all support each other and walk around feeling better the thing that's very cool too is that in that hour you have the experience that you have I always feel so much better I always feel better for the next day or two and then it's really cool to come on back because you get to you start to see people you start to meet people you start to have relationships with other people and it's it's there's something very powerful about that you know it's it's interesting I mean of course we've experienced designed it the same way that we did with soul cycle I mean we do take you through sort of a hero's journey in the same way that we did in Soul cycle um there are definitive moments there's breath work there's music so there's you know there's an oxytocin release there's a dopamine release I mean we are we definitely did sort of look at the way that our brain reacts to connection to kind of figure out what are key moments that we can hit for people during these gather so that they definitely will feel better you know when they leave the other thing to talk about is they're really two use cases for peoplehood so one when we talk about this epic of loneliness especially with young people digital over usage people that don't know how to be in this world after covid there is this idea that you can come to peoplehood and of course meet new people and not just meet them but have meaningful connections with them really feel like somebody got to know you in less than an hour and then there's this other idea that you can come and strengthen existing relationships which is we do couplehood in the room when we're working with atwork teams it's people that have relationships with each other and I think people are sick of small talk honestly I think there's a real place for this I mean is there ever an opportunity I think it's gotten to the point where we we're lacking so much human connection and it's been so clearly linked to depression and bad outcomes is there a a possibility that at some point this might get covered by Medicaid or insurance or a doctor might write a prescription to go to peoplehood for 6 or 12 sessions I mean have you thought about how this interacts and does interact with our kind of healthcare complex I mean that's our big dream honestly is to just make this as widely available as possible and the thing that's so awesome is that Julie has you she comes out of a talent background and so she just really understands how to help people learn how to facilitate these conversations and hold space for other people and it's really not I mean it's complicated but it is also there's a lot of Simplicity to it so it would be incredible if we could do that but that's the big dream Scott I like that you got there first that's the dream and what what give me a sense for the curriculum or I imagine it's not just a group of eight or 12 people that sit down and start talking what is do you pick a topic what are the most popular topics generally speaking if you if someone wanted to try this what would you suggest that their first step is yeah there's you know there there's a lot of different ways that we people at peoplehood right so um you can do it by cohort there are certain people that want to be in groups with people that have something really in common with them so we have motherhood we have couplehood we have singlehood uh we have a lot of different groups you know we have a female founder Hood uh we have a lot of groups where you kind of know that just by virtue of who you're grouping with that you are going to be talking about parenting challenges or business challenges or you know the the the conversations are sort of implied in what the group is gathering around uh right now we are doing a relational reset it's a five-week challenge where a group has signed up to go through this program together and we're learning everything from how to talk to people to how to be a better friend to how to be more interesting to ultimately how to navigate conflict right because isn't that kind of the Hope isn't the hope that after we practice having conversations with each other in a new way first we see our dinner tables change then we see our offices change then we see our marriages change and ultimately we're living in cities that are a little bit different and maybe even countries where people can talk to each other and live with different ideas or opinions um but not have to um be intolerant of each other because of it we'll be right back I really interested when you said the term singlehood because I think that online dating is a disaster I I think it's profoundly bad for men and it's just generally bad for women and now over half of relationships are beginning online it is does that work in this context and do you try and have a gender balance do you have singlehood for lgbtq and is that what offering here has surprised you to the upside and the downside well it's interesting I mean singlehood has been very interesting I think singlehood has also served a couple of different purposes I think people that are single feel feel lonely like all of us and I think a lot of times just to be in a room with other single people uh whether or not you're actually meeting somebody that you're going to hook up with I I think that single people are finding other single people and their friends are introducing them to other friends if they're not themselves going out on dates and so we've definitely uh started a Friday night singlehood where people can come and there's there's wine and cheese and there's an hour to talk and some time to socialize afterward and that has definitely become a lively offering and I agree with you Scott I think people are grateful to be in person meeting other people uh and then we've also done singlehood in a different way where we do the conversation and then we do you know some some speed dating afterward where you get to meet a bunch of different people pretty quickly and have one-on-one conversations with them face to face rather than swiping left or swiping right which also seems like a really novel conversation these ways and um I I think it's interesting people also we've also done friending that way as well uh I think that young people want to meet friends in person as much as they want to meet dates in person and we've been having a lot of success with kind of this idea of friendship gathers with some speed friending before and after which has also been very interesting so this is more a question from one entrepreneur to to two other entrepreneurs but you know it's going to be you know I don't know if I'll get a straight answer here but whenever I've been fortunate enough to have a successful go with something it's usually 10 years and I come off it and I have some capital and some confidence and some people who want to you know who made money and so they want to back me in whatever I do and almost always my next thing is not nearly as successful I just I I go into it with I'm too aggressive I spend too much money and also I just think luck I I don't think you realize how hard I didn't realize just how many moons line up have to line up for success I have never had two wins in a row and my question is is this harder easier uh you know what's it like starting I couldn't start a business again at this age I just don't have the tread left on my tires for the and the and the calling people who don't want to hear from me and I just don't have it in me anymore what is different about starting a business this time are there things you forget about that were you know so hard has it been easier and what's it like starting a business at this age versus when you started one 17 years ago yeah I mean this is this is an entire pod actually um but let me just say that you know tread on the tires is a great way to say it um I think that you do forget what it was like I think uh actually it's much harder because when we when we launched Soul cycle it was kind of like everything exceeded our expectations you know we were so we just caught fire pretty quickly and when you say it takes 10 years I mean we became profitable in like eight months so it was uh you know it was it was a pretty quick win and although obviously it wasn't a win to the scale that it ultimately became a win too for us everything kind of felt like a win now of course you know you're so worried to put something out into the world for fear it won't be perfect or people are looking at it or people are judging you and so your own ego can kind of really get in the way with that I think in many ways uh you also you know the world has changed right and so you're constantly kind of looking around at younger people smell testing everything to make sure that you know your uh wiser and older perspectives although obviously completely additive and in so many ways you know the wisdom of years can't be replicated I do think you also need to have a team around you that is that is really operating in a younger world that is using the technology that we're using today that is consuming the way that we're consuming today so you know you're constantly poking holes through your own Theory and the last thing I'll say is that you just go to your desk every single day and you try to turn off the periphery Vision that you've learned over the years I mean look I worked at a place like we work for a couple of years Scott I mean where every day we were opening in in India China and Japan all at the same time right and you try not to think about scale like that you try to think about One customer walking through your door and if they would leave and tell a friend and if you think the product is that good if you think it has that kind of impact on people then you just keep going Elizabeth let me ask you a similar question and I'm fascinated by this is someone who's been an entrepreneur my whole life I've never had success in something that I didn't work so hard that it impacted my relationships my mental and my physical health I'm just not talented enough to work 40 or 50 hours a week and have something be successful and I've heard those people are out there I haven't met them and what I find about entrepreneurship and what I tell entrepreneurs is unless you're just sort of willing to go all in it's probably not going to work and the thing that has reduced that fire for me quite frankly is money I got wealthy about 10 years ago and I'm just not willing to call my partner and say I can't make dinner I'm not willing to miss the Spring Concert with my kids I I shoved all of that to the side in my late 30s and early 40s because I needed money and I didn't have it or no I didn't even need it I was fine but I really wanted it and I was willing to make those tradeoffs and I no longer am and as a result I don't think I'd be nearly as successful an entrepreneur you're both very wealthy now how do you maintain or can you maintain that same sort of hunger and grit that I think is sort of The Secret Sauce in building a company from zero it's a calling this is a calling it's exactly what you're doing with your podcasts like your podcasts require a lot of effort and a lot of energy and a lot of vulnerability on your part and a lot of really like in honestly like intense interest inspection and permissioning hundreds of thousands of people and that is what we're interested in trying to understand what's going on politically what's going on environmentally what's going on personally what's going on professionally is people have so many demands and we really believe that if people take a small amount of time and devote that to connecting with other people in a meaningful manner that we will start to be able to understand what it is that that are what we actually need in this moment we will get out of the distractions that are kind of pulling us all around and that is a very powerful and potent thing for us individually and that we feel like it's time to like get out there into like you said into the retail World it doesn't seem like anybody is really doing this and we're kind of tired of all the talk we're doers we just want to make things happen and so yes there is a price to pay there is a tax to pay it happens you never know where it's going to happen that day it just depends um but I think that we also are good at cutting through the noise and so we're able to kind of just keep moving forward let me let me also just add that you know um Elizabeth and I have done a lot of this work I mean this is the work that we started doing in our partnership uh back in 2006 we realized pretty early on that to be in a successful partnership uh two people don't just have the same opinion the same point of view and want to do the same thing with their business at all time we started working with a coach very early on we work with that same coach today we have our conversations in two parts the first meeting we go in and we say what we think and we don't solve anything and in the second meeting we go in and we've actually heard each other and can Now operate from a point of understanding somebody else's world and so ironically that kind of work and what we're putting into the world saved our relationship the first time I've done this work in my marriage um pretty much learned a second language uh my husband and I very early on started to practice something called AO uh where we learn to talk uh in a different in a different way we make an appointment and we actively listen to each other also very much saved and transformed um you know my marriage and so ultimately I think that a lot of what we're putting into the world is a relationship saver Julie rice and Elizabeth kler are the co-founders of peoplehood a firm dedicated to improving our relationships Julian Elizabeth are also the co-founders of Soul cycle after growing to 60 Studios as co- CEOs Julian Elizabeth sold the company in 2016 they join us from a cold and wintry New York um I appreciate so much that you're not just I don't know hanging out in St Barts or started a VC fund to invest or whatever it is people do after a big exit and that you're going back at it and I love I think it that you're trying to ensure our species doesn't evolve or devolve into something less wonderful and I think that's happening with people not touching smelling and feeling each other so really do appreciate your good work and um uh enjoyed speaking with you and and and and generally for a lot of reasons hope hope the peoplehood is successful thanks so much
