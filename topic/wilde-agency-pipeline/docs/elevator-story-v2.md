# The Wilde Agency Elevator Story v2

Refining with: protocol, compound, platform × experience × AI

---

## The Formula

**Platform × 30 Years Experience × AI = The Protocol**

Fast because:
- Hard work already done
- Team alignment baked in
- Optimized early decisions that prevent later friction, complexity, backtracking

---

## Elevator Story Iterations

### Version 1: The Protocol
> "AI made demos easy. Real software—products that scale and don't break—is still hard.
>
> We built a protocol: platform × 30 years of experience × AI. It compounds. Every good decision we've made lives in it.
>
> We use it to launch our own ventures fast. Occasionally, we let the right project run on it."

---

### Version 2: The Compound Protocol
> "Building software compounds. Every good decision makes the next one easier. Every shortcut haunts you later.
>
> We've been compounding good decisions into a protocol for 30 years. Platform. Experience. AI. All multiplied together.
>
> When you build with us, you start with 30 years of compound advantage—not from scratch."

---

### Version 3: The Anti-Friction
> "Most software projects slow down as they grow. Friction, complexity, backtracking. The early shortcuts catch up.
>
> We built a protocol that eliminates that. Optimized early decisions. Team alignment baked in. Hard problems already solved.
>
> That's why we're fast. Not because we rush—because we don't have to."

---

### Version 4: The Multiplier
> "There's AI coding. There's experienced engineering. And there's what happens when you multiply them together on a battle-tested platform.
>
> Platform × Experience × AI. That's our protocol. We use it to launch ventures.
>
> When we take on your project, you get that multiplier working for you."

---

### Version 5: The Proprietary Magic
> "Everyone has AI tools now. Experience is rare but exists. What almost nobody has is a protocol that compounds both.
>
> Platform × 30 years of decisions × AI. We built it for ourselves. We use it to launch ventures fast.
>
> The right projects get access. That's Wilde Agency."

| Phrase | Feel |
|--------|------|
| "Not an agency—a protocol." | Sharp differentiator |
| "Platform × Experience × AI" | The formula |
| "30 years of decisions, compounded." | Accumulated advantage |
| "Fast because the hard work is done." | Explains speed without "rushing" |
| "You start with compound advantage." | What they get |
| "We built it for ourselves. That's why it works." | Trust |

## One-Liner Attempts

**Full:**
> "We built a protocol—platform × 30 years experience × AI—that creates production software fast without the friction. We use it for our ventures. Occasionally, we let the right project run on it."

**Medium:**
> "Platform × Experience × AI. A protocol for real software, fast. We built it for ourselves—that's why it works."

**Punchy:**
> "30 years of good decisions, compounded into a protocol. Occasionally shared."

## The PEACE Framework v2

| | Soundbite |
|---|-----------|
| **P** | "Most software slows down as it grows. Friction, complexity, backtracking. The early shortcuts always catch up." |
| **E** | "We've been there. We've cleaned up messes. We've felt projects grind to a halt." |
| **A** | "So we built a protocol. Platform × 30 years of experience × AI. Optimized decisions that prevent friction before it starts." |
| **C** | "When you build with us, you run on that protocol. Compound advantage from day one." |
| **E** | "Fast because the hard work is already done. Real software, shipped—without the grind." |

## Protocol SaaS - Landing Page Concept

If the protocol itself is a product...

### Positioning
The protocol that powers the venture studio—now available as a service.

### Landing Page Draft

```
[Hero]
HEADLINE: The Protocol
SUBHEAD: Platform × Experience × AI
         30 years of good decisions, ready to run.

[Waitlist CTA]
Early access opening soon.
[Join the Waitlist →]

[What Is It]
A protocol for building production software fast.

Not templates. Not boilerplate.
A living system that compounds:
- Battle-tested platform
- 30 years of engineering decisions
- AI-optimized development flow

We built it to launch our own ventures.
Now we're opening access.

[Why It Works]
Fast—because hard work is already done.
Reliable—because early decisions prevent later friction.
Scalable—because architecture isn't an afterthought.

[Who It's For]
- Founders who've been burned by prototypes that couldn't become products
- Teams who want compound advantage, not another blank slate
- Builders who know the difference between demo and production

[Early Access]
We're opening the protocol to a limited group.

A venture studio that builds real software, fast.

## Two Products, One Protocol?

| Offering | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Wilde Agency** | We build with you on the protocol (service) |
| **The Protocol (SaaS)** | You build on the protocol (product) |

The protocol is the proprietary magic. The venture studio proves it works. The SaaS lets others access it.
