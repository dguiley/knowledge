# Building advanced AI agents is easier than you think

In this episode, the speaker discusses the practicalities of building advanced AI agents, emphasizing the importance of moving beyond generic tools to more customizable, user-friendly platforms like Crew AI's Studio.

## Core Thesis
The episode argues that while many online tools claim to support the creation of massive agent systems, these often fall short due to lack of customization. Instead, a more effective approach involves utilizing targeted frameworks and tools that allow for progressive complexity and better meet the needs of specific applications, such as personal training.

## Key Insights
- Many popular online solutions for creating massive agent systems are impractical for real-world applications due to their lack of customization and complexity.
- The **Four-Rung Ladder Framework** provides a structured approach to building functional AI agents, scaling from basic to complex designs.
- Multi-agent systems can be effectively used in personal training programs, where specialized agents perform distinct roles and use tailored tools.
- Crew AI's Studio offers a robust, accessible platform for developing AI agents, preferred by a significant number of Fortune 500 companies.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Start with simple agent building tasks and progressively incorporate more advanced features as you gain experience.
2. Leverage natural language tools and built-in examples within Crew AI to streamline the learning process and boost productivity.
3. Develop a multi-agent framework for customized training programs, optimizing each agent's use of tools and functions.
4. Utilize real-time data access and command options like "crewai tool publish" to enhance agent capabilities and integration.

## Notable Quotes
> "Everyone's out here building billion agent army videos on YouTube, but if you've ever tried one of them, you know that it's kind of useless in real life."
> "You just built like a distributable AI infrastructure."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
Understanding and applying these insights can significantly advance the Wilde Agency's ability to develop tailored AI solutions in areas like personalized client interactions and data-driven decision-making, ensuring competitive advantage in the evolving AI landscape.
