today on this SAS Academy podcast we've got one of my favorite people on the show ad perar serial entrepreneur an author with multiple books founder with multiple exits and just honestly a great person to be around he's also an e-commerce genius so if you're running any type of business that does anything in Ecom you're going to want to watch this episode all the way through I'm going to be quiet and getting this conversation cuz it's going to be awesome so ad welcome to the podcast man it's great to have you mat thanks for having me I love it so I'm going to just do a throwback right so we do a bunch of research before the podcast and I want to know the answer to one burning question who is AD Rockstar yeah it is a throwback um the story is simply that uh my birth name is Adrian Pinar so afrian very similar to Dutch my first language and I can't pronounce it in English because I have to roll my tongue differently um so when I started working online way back in the day 2005 um I started using a nickname from high school which was just 80 and crucially um as I started using that more and more and I kind of built a bit of brand around it I went for the two eyes cuz Nintendo Wii had just come out and I figured this is the perfect way to differentiate you know so the nickname had one eye to begin with yeah the nickname I I think the nickname just like nobody ever wrote it but like my my my Rugby playing buddies uh would call me 80 um so it was never written but when I started writing it uh I went double ey figured branding Etc be memorable what's it purple cow SE Goden um and then for the long longest times as I started working in WordPress uh I would just that's actually it was cool to say you're a rockar at something so I was just 80 with a tagline WordPress Rockstar and then eventually um I felt that I wanted to kind of broaden my horizons a little bit beyond just WordPress and I just dropped the WordPress alt together I just went 8 Rockstar for the longest reason um I used that instead of AD P I mean I think uh you know for it was probably like 2011 2012 I was like no this is like kind of juvenile now I I can just be my myself I can just be ADR uh which is what I now use so but it was um it was a fun time I mean even now like all my taglines I still say ex rockar and people ask me like were you in a rock band I'm like dude I love music I can't play a musical instruments at all at all but dude it's funny because there's I think it's like it shows your mindset right I think that you just like owned it you just went all in on the Rockstar thing it's just like just like a company right which that's the thing right which is very I I think that's um you know very indicative of the time and it's me reflecting in real time now uh I think at that stage there's some kind of you know ignorance is bliss kind of mindset to it you just do things you don't think about the consequences or the bigger picture I think you know if I contrast that to where I'm at today um loads of experience both life and and and business uh one almost tends to overthink these things right like I don't know whether if I'd never done that back then whether I would pull off that now right like I'd find so many reasons to just not do it yeah Johnny says that all the time about entrepreneurship he's always like if if there was a bottle and you could read the label on the bottle of what it's actually like a lot of people wouldn't even do it no exactly right um I mean and I've honestly like even though there's been um I mean I think every entrepreneur uh would attest to the fact that it's a roller coaster right um but even through all ups and downs like it's been mostly a 15 16 17 journey of um net success for me yet I kind find that it becomes harder to some extent right because it feels like I you know I become more aware of the pitfalls the challenges the hardships whereas back then there was just there was just youthful exuberance around just doing cool yeah um and trying to make money off it so speaking of youthful exuberance so if you're listening to this and you don't know ad has founded some companies that you've probably heard of woo themes and woo Commerce in the um in the WordPress space are probably the most notable I think on a large scale scale you started woo themes in like 0708 then woo commerce was a fast follow in 2010 like how did you apply your youthful exuberance right or to ask a better question like what got you started building the themes company and then P the pivot into e-commerce like what what was going on back then in that area of time yeah I mean themes was um a consequence of a I wanted a Blog mhm uh found WordPress figured I can teach myself some PHP self-taught very limited programmer um did that and then I started realizing that the stuff that I was doing on WordPress I could do those for clients so uh whilst I was at Varsity I did some freelancing and then I had this um realization like I wasn't the only one there were like two or three others in the space um that started thinking along the same lines which is can we take these things that we're doing for customers in a for customers in a on self kind of manner on top of Wordpress and kind of productize that right so that instead of kind of doing one to one you can do kind of your one to more at the very least and that really was the kind of the the impetus for for wo themes I think for me the bigger picture there is always like can I democratize the the power of the platform to a broader audience of people um at a lower cost right essentially making it more accessible and that's it's interesting because and I I can't I mean this what I tell you now right I think that where the seeds were there um but that is something that was you know kind of very um inherent in every business that I started this idea of like you know can I back the underdog like I Al I also have a huge passion for smbs versus actually selling into the Enterprise for exactly that reason like in my mind there'll be more people making you know $100,000 a year than $100 million a year right like that's just the kind of passion but anyway so that's that's how I got into kind of Wordpress and the theming side of things um what ultimately happened for woo was we found that the kind of the the biggest growth category for us and themes was we call business themes at that stage so just different kind of businesses that want some kind of brochure like website like regardless of what industry they were in and they kept asking us for a shopping cart like hey I just like those were the words I remember it kind of um you verly like can I just add a shopping cart to my my my site um and at the time there there was no amazing um e-commerce plugins available for WordPress releast M and we ultimately had three false starts um trying to build it in house trying to partner with the WordPress core contributor trying to partner with another WordPress cor contributor because it was even though wukar today is such a vast um you know or vastly used uh plug-in and and platform uh we weren't that great engineering like we designed really beautiful products and we understood how they worked but engineering I wouldn't say like we were like 90th percentile kind of engineer so we tried to partner and it wasn't until we ultimately found two guys Jay and Mike that we're building something else uh very similar for another company that um and we UL we tried to acquire them the company said no cuz we low B them for an offer that's part of the story that's should be more evidence here but we persuaded um Jay and Mike to come build for us and they essentially took the beauty of open sources they took what they had built um and they um built wo Commerce for us and became core kind of integral members of the team what is also fascinating at Le there and like I I love telling this part is we still figured that we would build woocommerce because it would allow us to sell more themes mhm and Jay and Mike brought the model of selling kind of add-ons or extensions or little app that's on top of w Commerce so core plugin for free and then you sell these other things um and I remember it was about I think 13 14 15 months um that woocommerce and especially those kind of extensions those add-ons became 90% of our business so I mean yes it kind of flew from a you know very strong base at that stage um but that's there was some luck involved there was some again youth exuberance in ter of saying like I'll just go we'll just go do this thing and kind of the model follow afterwards I love that because I think a lot of the time it's when you have success you have an exit it's so tempting to go back and say you know I had this this master plan where I saw this huge you know Gap in the e-commerce market for smbs we went and built this thing and like that's the real story is the way you laid it out it's like we were selling themes people asked for a shopping cart we built a shopping cart and we just kept doing stuff until it worked and and I guess like the beauty of that mat is that I mean we it was completely boot trapped like we we had no um agenda or requirement from kind of external investors accept what we want to do right as as as co-founders in in the business which meant that we could truly I think you do two things right like a you stick to your values and B you follow your best customers and you kind of you figure out like how can how can I make them more successful how can I charge for that like all of those kind of your good things we never consider things like what is the you total market for this or um you know how do we need to get to the next fundrais round or how are we ultimately going to sell this thing right like none of those things and maybe again like that's also just youthful exuberance I think in subsequent companies I I definitely put more thought into that um but at the time like it was it really was just um having fun and doing some cool things yeah so you mentioned that there were no good emphasis on good you mentioned there are no good WordPress oriented e-commerce Solutions in 2010 like who were the competitors who else was in the game was Shopify doing stuff like who were who were you up against when you did this so Shopify was still early on we actually did some work with Shopify so some are our you know themes that ultimately work for wo Commerce we actually ported to Shopify as well um I mean I think there's a whole fascinating thing in there as well where you know because we came from the open source world we always just felt that kind of a rising tide lift all boats right um Beyond Shopify magenta was obviously there um I think the key though and the reason even like the the incumbents in the WordPress space the reason we didn't go with them either was their templating language was limited and the one thing that wo stood for was we worked with some of the best designers at the time web designers at the time uh because we really wanted to design beautiful kind of websites and kind of interfaces and we didn't think that we could do it with that um Magento was like extensive and very workable but hard to maintain hard to design for Etc and shopy was the new kid on the Block um that was just coming out of that kind of initial um stint where they essentially built kind of You Toby and his co-founders had built shopy to be just to power their own uh snowboard I think it was a snowboard store or something like that right so they had just come out of that and start kind of opening up their ecosystem to other themes to other apps to start extending um the kind of the the chord that they had built what would you um what would you do differently if you were running if you were back in 2010 and step in the time machine and you're running woocommerce now is there any product decisions you do differently or different ways to execute I mean I guess the kind of you know one of the challenges that you know wo still has to this day is due to it being a self-hosted decentralized platform you don't get the kind of data sharing um and it's not about Just J date sharing but the economies of scales that well the V virality that comes with it right so simple example there would be something like know Shope um because it's a hosted platform it's easy for them from an infrastructure kind of standpoint to roll that out right um which is why I think you know Shopify today is significantly more kind of you know a payments company first than a software company second right um that like thinking back like that still woo kind of your challenge was also a challenge back in 20110 I don't think that it's um I don't think there's an obvious answer to um my gut feel is that you know people that pick you people that picked wooc Commerce back in the day had very specific reasons for doing so um and they probably still do that today and you know I've often been asked in you know in a world where you know shopy is the biggest econ platform in the world woocommerce is second in terms of volume some people argue about volume but I think shopy has the the quality um of merchants along with the volume that that exceeds that of of wo and people me like is this just going to shop F going to win or takes all market and I actually think that's not the case I think you know there's still reasons for people to want to work with the open source solution that they can self host um that works in a slightly kind of a different way so yeah I mean I like I remember when I bought it you know when I started using it because it was I was already on WordPress and I didn't want to leave the ecosystem and do something else so it just it looked like it was a component of my website and that made sense to me so I bought it you know um and the reason what prompted that question is I was thinking back on my own Journey when I was a customer of yours right like I think we we implemented the shopping cart and then I feel like I remember you fact check me but I feel like I remember I was buying like alicart features I think right so I needed like a different type of checkout flow or and and what popped into my head is I don't remember you guys ever doing Payment Processing like inside of of woo right and so I I think you you spoke to that in the self-hosted versus manage thing and I mean those were the very early days I mean I can't I think in the various like 20 I mean it should be fact checked but I didn't think stripe existed for example like it was still really hard I mean I think the of in the early days the payment processor that extension that we sold uh that grossed most was authorized.net right and it was it was crappy to work with back then like it's nothing like payments was just hard like there were a lot of God rails you know around it so I mean I didn't think you know we we when I ultimately left wo in in 2013 um we had started contemplating how to build a just a hosted version of woo but even then like payments was not the thing right like I think to that extent at least like what chop five done um they were Visionary right like somewhere along their Journey they they saw that the way to Best monetize this is through payments and they they went after it hard and they um you know in payments I wouldn't say they have a monopoly in terms of e-commerce you know kind of payments but sha is a really compelling product both for consumers and for merchants yeah um and it's very hard to compete against that today yeah and it's wild when you look at their financials you know being a public company it's like their merchant services line item is many times their software line now the gross margin is lower but still I mean it's it's a big business unit doing all that stuff it's it's pretty impressive massive yeah it's wild so you sold that what year did you sell that so I stepped down as a CEO in 2013 um and I actually sold at that stage to Magnus mark my co-founders so I sold out to them um um partly because I had felt that like I can't fully move on whilst this thing was still here yeah um and again there's probably some youth little exuberance there as well like I hindsight um I could have probably moved moved on in terms of where my mental energy was without having to kind of cash out completely um and then woo got acquired by automatic um in I think it was May 2015 but at that stage when I had no equity um I found out on the day that it was announced on tech runch oh wow um so yeah what um like what are the big lessons there that's an unconventional exit story that I'm learning some of this for the first time in this conversation like what what's your pickups on that I mean I think you know hindsight is very much important here um I mean the my exit from woo was tricky in that Magnus Mark and I fought for almost two years um and it's you know I can't dispute the fact that that frustration or anger or negative emotions um also pushed me out right or I let it push me out and I think like I think that that's important like that's the negative part of this um because ultimately like jumping ahead again like I I can only go and Report the number like the the the value that I had sold for is vastly different to what Magan Market sold for 15 months later yeah right so a lot of chips kind of be left on the table um the I think the important part to it like the part that I wouldn't say just softened that um was the fact that like the the reason why I ultimately needed to leave was I had this thing at the back of my head saying 80 is one at Wonder um and I wanted to figure out like whether I can take all these learnings and reapply and build another business and I think that was ultimately much more important to me than an extra million or two whatever the number would have been um from a kind of financial standpoint because otherwise it I think with wo um I like you know we definitely work hard I think we made good decisions we tried things we were creative of all those things I don't think our success is undeserved but also feel kind of Lucky right like I mean this was you know first business straight out of Varsity um it wasn't I think the the extent of the success is massive right and even today I mean just to kind of you try and quantify that success is uh the my best called out kind Outreach email still starts with hey Matt I'm 80 co-founder of w Commerce right even though I've not been involved in the company in what 10 11 years now right there's a there's a lot of significance kind of to that um so but I I said like because it always felt that luck was a kind of big part there you know there in um I needed to go do it again to to tell myself that it was yes there's still luck I still believe there was luck but yes there was always some you know some parts of me that helped make that successful so you know I talk with a lot of Founders who've exited a lot of them who've exited one company you've exited multiple but there's a common theme in all of them which is they leave their first company we all have the same fear I had the same fear right it's like was this all luck or do I actually am I actually good or not right or do I suck but a lot of Founders they have this list of things where they say now that I'm a repeat founder here's this list of stuff I'm going to go do differently in my next company so I'm curious I'm sure you probably had that list what were a couple of things from the list um the the funny one in hindsight funny or ironic one in hindsight was the first one on the list yes I had that list by the way it's written on Notebook I still have that notebook as well um the first one on the list was I will not have co-founders again not going to have co-founders no not have co-founders so mean converio that came after that um I was solo founder um but there was mostly because I I I got burnt um and I you know hindsight there was just like we were not proactive enough on aligning on values at the start of the journey right so we we tried to do that much later on but at that stage like w was such a big business right like it's it's just such a heavy subject when you have you an idea um then it's easier to I think to to have those things so that was on the list um what else did I have on the list um I had on the list build a team sooner um building a team or at least a kind of a that kind of executive level team or sea level team uh was something we only got to into much later and I wished that we had done that sooner um and then one thing that was very prevalent that I worked a lot on going into convergia was um and it's that Jason Cohen who's now runs WP engine I believe he like I heard it from him first and he said um culture like every team has a culture whether you do something about it or not right and I think with woo um our culture kind of happened to us and not that it was a bad culture but big parts of the culture was just was We Were Young boozy when we kind of hung out together had fun um there's no real sense of like any concrete values that that we were explicit enough about that would actually kind of create some kind of cohesion right so going into convergia is very adamant that I wanted to nail what that culture was and I wanted something that was more value driven yeah than this thing that just happened to us at woo even though part of it obviously was very functional and great even right like I've I've have only good memories of the kind of the the the time building that company yeah there's parallels there between that and the whole talk track of firsttime founder versus second time founder right is even if something great happens it's different if it happens to you versus if you caused it to happen you know with your with your actions we had um so Kevin dorsy is like legendary sales trainer um he was at one of our Board of events our last one and he said one of his key values that he teaches every team he works with and every rep that he supervises is even if you have great results if you can't explain why you got them like I don't care yeah right if you can't if it's just an accident it's not that it's not that helpful exactly right and even if like I'll take it a step further even if you're able to do that like that in itself does not directly translate to you being able to do it again repeatable the next time right like I think the the the amount of um Clarity that you need around why it worked needs to be so indepth that you can actually kind of you know put that to work in a whole new context um in future that's interesting so woo themes woo Commerce sold those conversio exited that company right um cogy so that's the third e-commerce startup so I mean when we say you know you certainly your stripes in in e-commerce land you know um you've been in this game since the late 2000s what's changed over the past 10 years in Ecom like where's where's the market going if I'm new getting into the Ecom game right now you know what's how would you explain to me what's been happening I think um the whatever we' seen it matters that you Ecom has gone through a few phases initially was all around the platform itself and payments like that was the big first phase of how do we make this more accessible um then there was a second phase around on um everything marketing rated acquisition right um the rise of kind of your Google ads Facebook ads meta ads um really getting that dialed in the the kind of the clavio like tools that we built around email marketing automation um like that saw a big big ramp up um recently I think the phase where we're in is more operational I think um through all of that it became much easier to start e-com business um the product sourcing you became much easier whether you're you know kind of um you Manufacturing in in China or Asia and you're importing it wherever in the world um like that became more accessible and and not just not just the Drop Shipping sensor of like really kind of your high quality you products so I think in in all markets geographically and kind of sectors uh it's just more competitive which means that there is a phase now where the kind of operational challenges or logistical challenges around this is more top of mind um but that has such a that I suspect that that has such a very physical constraint um that I don't know whether we can actually whether software will actually change that mean um if you think about um think about having to ship a container of goods from Asia to the states anywhere right there's nothing software can do about that just like there's you know uh you know there's certain physical laws around like hey container is just so big right it needs to be on a ship and the ship can only you know go that fast not much you can do around that right so I think the the constraints there you're getting into real life constraints um so I suspect what actually happens there over time is uh consumer behavior is going to change again right where you know Venture Capital can't subsidize the delivery of products where you don't make margin right hence hence why we find so many direct consumer Brands um that ultimately don't make it they have this massive runup right in recent years I think the best publicized example was Casper right like for for every mattress they sold they were actually losing $400 or something right um which is perfectly fine in the runup but then when investors lose their appetite to fund this then there is no business left right so I I actually think that I suspect or My Hope here always is that you know as as consumers we move to being more conscious consumers right where we actually don't demand you know Same Day deliveries right or free returns right because I mean again I'm I'm I'm bad at this right like I hate clothes shopping so what do I do I order like the say like same two pants two different sizes and they can deliver both of them to me and I try them out at home you know my convenience and I send one back right but I mean that that creates so much cost and friction in the system no software can can solve that um at least so I actually acknowledging that if software can't change that I think what is probably more interesting is how we start um thinking about how physical Goods show up in our digital world and what that means especially for younger generation right um I'm not the target audience here probably right but I think that's interesting um because the one thing that's also happened the last you couple of years is uh it's become harder to acquire a customer both due to competition but also due to kind of your privacy changes on multiple platforms right so the acquisition is slightly harder so it it's going to be interesting to see how is said like how our physical product show up in digital ws and how that translation works right cuz at some stage like it's fun to see a b of water in digital world but then hey I actually want to drink the water right I think that there's something there um and maybe that's just the simplest example or just a concrete example of how I suspect like the next Frontier is around these new experiences that lead to new customer um kind of Channel channels um and new ways of purchasing Goods so I'm not an e-commerce specialist in any sense of the words this might be a goofy question but I'm thinking through what you're explaining just as simply a a system with you know constraints almost like a conveyor belt so to speak do you see anything on the horizon that might change the manufacturing side like you you talked a lot about having to Traverse the globe on ships right is there any way to empower more localized manufacturing for some of these goods and solve the problem that way I mean I've always stayed away from any any hardware stuff um I suspect yes there is something interesting there um it also just feels like China's miles ahead of of any other country in the world in terms of manufacturing quality at the cost at which they can do it right um which again means that like even if you were to make that that shift you somewhat probably need the consumer to say hey like it's okay I will buy something local even though it costs me more yeah right than than the important good so like I I don't see I cuz there needs to be like it's a bit of a chicken egg right like either consumers demand it or somebody subsidizes this in some way whether it's a government whether it's a kind of investor group right um it's all possible but someone needs to make the first move for for that to change and it's a big bet it's a big move to make yes yeah how do you see some of the new technologies influencing consumer Behavior whether it's AI or augmented reality like I've seen some neat startups coming around in fact your example about buying two pairs of pants like seen one where there's an app that like scans you and they're trying to minimize returns like what are some some cool things you're seeing in the space around that I think that um the thing that I'm actually most curious about Matt um that I think will kind of you play out Beyond just you know Commerce um is that you know for years if you have a look at kind of how uh our marketing has evolved right like like we've done certain things to essentially personalize it more for the person that we're marketing to right so typical kind of SAS world would be um you know you click on a specific ad you get a specific landing page um that puts you into specific sign up flow we ultimately segment you like there's Behavior driven kind of you based on how you use the product like all of those things right all of those things got us closer to personalization I think kind of your next step I I don't think it's good enough yet or cost efficient enough yet but with the llms that goes into that kind of your ratches up again right because you are now in theory able to send a personalized message to every customer every single time right so it's not just saying send this you know this default email maybe with like a few kind of your variables thrown in there to this segment and this to that segment right like that's still that's dumb relative to what llms can do so I'm curious to see how like to what extent that essentially plays out and like all of marketing is essentially one to one driven by AI um versus more kind of your coort or segmented approaches and it's funny when I think about that because I still think it's changing a little bit but it's still very text focused as far as the medium goes like I picture a world where there's I'm getting served ads for sunglasses and it's my picture with the sunglasses on yeah I mean that's it's not that far away well exactly right like image generation is is is probably there as well right um maybe not an identity but yes right like there are things there that you know will almost kind of you start in meshing itself to create a better product right again like taking e-commerce like something that we've used for ages is you know any brand that knows anything about you uh will start showing you prodct that you should buy based on whatever Behavior you have whether it's browsing or purchasing Behavior right um but now you can imagine like doing that adding the language part into it adding some image generation into it where like you're also showing me the version of the image that you think will make me click the kind of your buy now button right um like it just becomes personalization to the nth degree yeah Theory and with the privacy laws at least well I mean we're never going to know if it's working or not right just keep just keep trying it well like it's it's the reason you mentioned privacy I'll like the the other part um just the recent Fascination and you know part of my I I rejoined automatic W you know W's parent company at the start of the year um to try you know a different path and you know through that I've um been energized to dive into the world of Open Source again and I think like one thing that I've learned about open source is that it's a great counterweight to privacy concerns right and um the best example I have here is currently with all these kind of your AI or llm rappers that were building whatever service provider software provider they're sending it to open AI or someone else right and it's not very private and goes into a black box right and you can't really check it um I mean even with Apple's Rec recent announcements around Apple intelligence I think that they're trying a lot with this kind of whole private Cloud compute that they're building and they're trying to do as much they can on device right but because it's closed Source you still need to trust them yeah that they're not doing anything nefarious with the data right and I'm not suggesting people are malicious but you know I think money you know does pervert or the incentive is always there yeah the Temptation is always there to um to to play in the gray areas right to come back I think what is interesting is um you know in in in B2B SAS how much of that functionality will Brands and businesses just want to self host right can I for example self host fair enough you're still hosting with you know Amazon AWS where is your or with Google right but I'm hosting my own llm open source llm with my own CRM and I I know exactly what's working and how that data is being used and being fed into the machine right so we're maybe moving away from cloud computing you know at least in terms of the you know centralized hosted manner um as a way beyond that which also opens up you if you're using open source models there that's the way to fine-tune things right like that's the way where you're not just relying on a kind of your open AI kind of General model to provide value but you're providing value for your specific business case yeah I've seen you know recently uh Jason and dhh from base camp right they just launched the self-hosted what's the they're calling it once right where saying you know we're only charge you one time buy the code stand it up um it's made a big splash honestly it's uh it's pretty interesting the the numbers probably numbers reported numbers suggest that um the model is probably more experimental at this stage than than than than valuable but yes I think that there is a there's an interesting part there you know in that plus I think what is interesting in that I I mean I think it's Mark andreason from way back back in the day um published an article he's at least he's quoted and saying um you know we go through phases of bundling things unbundling them and we bundle them again in a new way right and I think maybe we're just in that little bit of a kind of unbundling also acknowledging like I think we're once makes sense is you know as once subscriptions got into the world of consumers right not just going to B2B sass right I think there's a little bit of sub subscription fatigue right yeah teely is so like again like just as a counter way to that like is there a way in which I can just self Host this yeah right is there a way in which I can pay like a lower annual license you know for this to get updates for example I think there's um my takea away from that is just that I think that there's a little bit of you know kind of space there to be Innovative in terms of how we build software build and sell software um you know in this next phase um of the internet versus the way done it in the last 10 or 15 years so what I hear you telling me is that I'm going to buy Photoshop in a box for $1,000 on a CD ROM again right I I mean maybe in a box uh I don't think I don't think CD ROM is is probably out of question we don't have computers with you know kind of USC RS anymore I mean I don't at least um but yes I mean I I think that there is some version of that that um you know could be true um just with a modern spin yeah that's cool I'd love to switch gears for a minute and talk about team and culture and just this whole thing about working with other human beings cuz it's complicated I would say business would be so easy if it wasn't for all the people involved you know but it's also the most important skill and so you know you talked about you know obviously a somewhat complicated relationship with your co-founders and woo and then the the first thing on your list of second time founder 80 here's I'm going to do different was I want to be a solo founder um what do you how did your Viewpoint evolve so were you did you stay a solo founder in conversio were you a solo founder in cogy like have you been a lone wolf all the way through or is your Viewpoint evolved since then no so with my team at converio um I got very close to the team a um and close in terms of relationships uh and I'd say I had a core group of people that I trusted more so one of them was was Stephano who was my first engineering hire um and eventually became our CTO and he ultimately became my co-founder in cogy but for one crucial Reason Not Just because the fact that like we had all this history of working together um but you and I also had a very high alignment in terms of our values yeah right both personal but also in terms of how we would like to work together um and that was really helpful and I think the kind of the the key there was as we were building converio um like he was not afraid to say know to things when it wasn't according to our values and that's hard sometimes right like you know when I'm pushing forward and I'm like saying hey team we're going to do that thing and someone says no no no no no no no yeah can we talk about this boss can we talk about values quick like this is like very contradictory um that's very frustrating at times but that refines that kind of understanding that shared understanding of what values you know are and how it should influence decision making right cuz it's not values can't just be something that you put on a wall like it it should be a living breathing thing that informs things um and he was that he was that custodian um that custodian and Confidant ultimately um that made me believe that he would be a great co-founder which he was um in cogy do you have a story or an example the first time he checked you on values it was probably always around um you know taking shortcuts for in making money like that's not something he stands for like there there's no should be no shortcuts and in terms of making money um but no there's no like beyond that like I'm speculating now there's no there's not a single story that pops up to mine or into mine uh in this moment that's cool it's all good I always like to ask cuz those are tenuous conversations sometimes it's because it it's such a like there's a set of conflicting emotions right where you say on the one hand you're ego gets hurt because someone's kind of gut checking you on something that you wanted to do and on the other hand you know that they're right and you're like damn like I'm going to have to eat my humble pie on this one you know so yeah well and I mean I think the interesting thing there is like can at least like if I um you know fast forward to that a little bit is like probably the one of the bigger things that Stephan and I had to work through was the immense seed round that we ultimately raised with with cogy I mean it was at the height of the you know the the the Zer times um um stupid money that say stupid money it was market rate but mean hindsight I mean it was it was very very rich and uh we also got the term sheet uh within four days my first conversation to term sheet was four days wow so everything had to happen very very fast and um you know it's it's in that where like he and I suddenly had to do a lot of like back and forth and realigning on like what does this mean for the company you know like uh cuz that's suddenly changes from where we thought we were like raise a bit of money then push to profitability um which is what we did with conversio into this whole kind of new realm right so but I think the the reason why we were able to do that is at that stage that you know there's just so much structure around other values because like values can also change right um and I don't mean that to say like you can flip-flop um especially if it's opposite things you're changing you for but I think values can be robust for a team for individuals for co-founders so that it creates a space to have that conversation about how to evolve right because I I think it's very hard to you know set some kind of value based like operating agreement yeah um and you write it down you agree it today and then you expect a 10 years down the line every single word of that going to be true because ultimately there's so many macro things that change right that you can't account for so you you need to have that space But the way you then make that decision of how like what will we change and how will we change that I think that's important what makes a worldclass company value that's a great question um I like probably two things Matt I think um I think firstly like the the founding team needs to have like immense it and conviction about it right cuz I think that's like that's the first part like if if you're going to be flimsy about it or flaky about it right that like it has no chance right um and then secondly like the the the clarity and the context that the team can build about around those values right um becomes the kind of the the part that really solidifies you know that the more you can build that out the more it becomes um some kind of navigational system for every single decision because the more context like you're always going to encounter a situation that might be totally unique from anything in the past but if you know like it's like understanding physics right you know that the world you you Works in this way when you encounter something new you can always draw it back to some of those first principles and I think for a value like that's ultimately what's important um and probably the last thing I I'll say there is like it needs to be something that ex I would say excites you gets you passionate like into the conviction part of it right like I think it's fine to say we're hardworking like I mean it's yeah I whatever right not that exciting no it needs to be something that that that you can rally around like something that is both kind of a Northstar and a motivator um on a day-to-day week toe basis I heard this interesting quote and I can't remember who said it so I'm sorry if you watched this and you said it but it was essentially saying that a great company value is only great if the opposite of the value could also be true right so like what like your example we're hardworking you'd never see a company with a value says we're lazy as we're not going to do anything right but like move fast and break things or it could be you know build the world's most stable platform you know if you're working in fintech or something like that and you it can't go down so I think that's an interesting one of it's a little bit polarizing you know in in respects where you've got to be able to say I'm going to opt in for that even though I could also opt in for the opposite of it if I wanted to work differently I thought that was interesting yeah cuz that's um that's where the conviction come from like you know if you think about entrepreneurship like it is a Choose Your Own Adventure right um and again like if like if you have to pick something like and it also forces specifically not picking something else right like that's the thing you're going to come back to and rally behind every single time like that's interesting so I have one more question on the co-founder thing it's like this is especially in when I talk to early stage Founders it's a huge question there's a lot of firsttime solo Founders who are hacking on an idea most of them non-technical maybe they've like hire a Dev shop or something they're like I really just want to find a co-founder so you are kind of someone who I look at as like a Visionary CEO founder who had a technical co-founder right but you're also a guy who went from I'm never having a co-founder again to someone who you speak very highly of um if you're in the shoes without the track record that you have right and you're looking for a co-founder and you don't know like there's no there's no Tinder for co-founder you swipe swipe right on somebody how the hell do you find that right person that you can build with um I mean I would firstly by the way say like I I know if and when I start something new I almost lean towards having a bigger co-founding team right I think there's probably a number which it becomes too big yeah but um I believe that that the diversity in skills and perspectives I think is important um so the way that I would probably do that like if you don't have an obvious place to do that is to build it organically within the team um and find those kind of early team members that can be a co-founder and and I think these things can be restated right like I think you can sometimes work with someone for a year and say you know what Matt like it's been a like it's been a wild ride like I think you should become a co-founder in this thing right because I mean founder co-founder I mean these are all just titles it's a title you assign right it means what you want it to mean exactly right like for me it's more around the person you're going to be the responsibilities you're going to take and I think like having someone that's similarly obsessed incentivized invested in the thing that you're doing that's not your wife or your partner right right like is so important that I wouldn't say take any dilution for that but Equity dilution should not be the thing that you're optimizing for there right I think um this the kind of I always like the the way I thinking like um I think it's closely related to an African PR but it's um you know if you if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far you know go together yeah and I think um it just helps it really really really helps having someone or you know some people alongside you that I said they have to share they have to live breathe eat sleep that business and the challenges especially you're in the early stages right because that's what you're doing you're you're you're tackling the one challenge after the next um and having someone else there is just easier it's it becomes very lonely if you don't have that so I think you can do that organically Stephano did that that that was my experience like within conversio he never had the title or the equity for that matter to justify it and he just had more of that like I'm going to act like an owner right and I should have probably I I could have with this perspective now I could have probably made that decision earlier to say listen you're like let's figure this out like let's like I shouldn't hold on to extra five or 10% Equity here um because that's always the question and like I I wonder had I done that sooner in convertor Journey whether it would have been a different outcome for example it's interesting I think people underestimate the performance difference that a properly incentivized person can have and it's not to say that I don't think people I don't think good people at least will deliberately sandbag it's not what I'm saying but I think that people have another gear there's always another gear right there's always someone who can go faster be more efficient or think differently about a problem and like those things the the titles the status the equity it like they really matter to people and I think that sometimes as people who tend to found things we can underestimate how important that stuff is to others you know exactly and I think the the the the key there is probably like figuring out what what is that unique incentive for every single person right because some people it might not be money right um especially might not be Equity like I've I definitely found that kind of equity is not always a great incentive for many people because it has such a long time Horizon right like figuring out how to instead pay that person a quarterly bonus or a quarterly profit share for example is significantly more motivating right but again like I think that's where that's part of the fun of building a team and building a culture because you can build it around these foundational kind of you know things um and then find humans that can slot into that and just run with it yeah so you've talked a lot about building a team that's the common theme through every story you've told just about and another thing on your second time founder list was I'm going to lean into building a team earlier what for you has been the biggest like differentiator in your ability to find a players to find these people you want to go build with how do you find them I think um I'm inherently a very like I find it easy to be vulnerable mhm um which I believe makes it easy for me to show up in a very humble is authentic Manner and I say humble is because you know like you know 80 Eddie Rockstar is not without ego right it's not without ego um but I think like the the way that I present especially in one-on-one conversations but in slightly Bard capacity or Bard context is that more like there's some authenticity to it there's some you know humility to it and I think what that helps do is um you know along with some tactical things about how to hire or how to attract in your candidates is the way you speak about the business is then more kind of your value driven right right and it's I think it somewhat softens this um cuz these are just like I don't think this is the only way of doing it but in in my world or my teams like the financial outcomes of things weren't necessarily the number one kind of your outcome that we wanted yes it needed to be you know a profitable sustainable business but didn't necessarily need to be a unicorn for example right and I think like what that means is I think you can find great team members irrespective of the type of business you need to build you just need to be very clear about the things that you're optimizing for and to your point earlier like what you're not optimizing for right because the best people will self- select then like I think that's the the key part there if they self- select and you like you essentially give them that information to make the best decision for themselves that's I think a much Sher path to finding a great kind of your team member in alignment that is in that kind of your a player um you know category I think it's when you somewhat you know kind of want to opusc the kind of business you want to build and you know or you hire someone in reputation that's not a fit then I mean they might be a great human being and but probably a better can you teammate and a different team that's interesting so you said a players will self- select so you're saying you've got to be very forthcoming about what the business is and what it isn't and like what it's like to work here I I suspect that a players have a greater self-awareness about at least around what their unique skills are how they want to work etc um which means that it's my responsibility to give them as much information as possible to make that decision because they I you can't I don't think you can get to know someone in an interview process to that level right like I think that there are great leaders in terms of how they judge kind of your people I think the the better way is to have that be more collaborative and also give the other person enough information so that they can almost chase you right or convince you or persuade you whatever that is but they're doing it because they have the information um about what you're trying to do and that probably carries on like the way I'm assuming you run a culture is probably very transparent as well yeah completely I think um I big believer and things like I mean we during during hiring um like one of things that we do we specifically and I've always done this like I get you to like write a hell of a lot of things before we ever jump on a call right because I want to make sure that how you write is of the standard that I expect of team members right because that that flows directly into the type of culture that I want way of working which is more asynchronous for example but also like all of those things lead into when it's you have a kind of a culture that's high on written you communication it also helps with things like transparency and like flattening of the org and ultimately you know having the information available to empower a whole team to make good decisions right where there's no information Arbitrage where some CA level or three C Level can exact up there they know what's going on but the biggest you know kind of you biggest part of the team they have no sense of what's going on there and they can't contribute or they can't say wait hold on maybe this is not the best decision because there's this thing over here right um so yes like me I think those values like they need to kind of infiltrate every single part of how you build a team in a business so I know this is a a personal like personal preference question but I'm curious you talked about leaning into writing and running an asynchronous team like what's your how does your ideal team work on their own we no like technically um what I've done um so wo was still um hybrid and in terms of part of the team had a small office in Cape Town about 10 of us um and by the time I left we had about 30 or so people distributed all over the world and that's actually somewhat harder like doing hybrid is harder because you always need to have that extra discipline of if I walked over to your desk and we had a conversation I need to figure out I need to remember how do I float that up into kind of a broader context right running a purely kind of remote or distributed team or purely collocated team I think takes that away right because you only need need one discipline you don't need some kind of your hybrid of those communication disciplines right um so that's something to keep in mind the other thing that we did Matt was um I'm still a firm believer especially in the early days I think having some synchronous time together even if you're distributed is helpful right like I think there is something to be said about you know being able to have a if I have an idea and I can shoot that off and like you're like oh yes Eddie like this is great I like that and I like that and have you thought about this and like just that the Ser Deputy that comes from synchronous conversations is important so tactically what we always did was um you know based in Cape Town so say Central European Time um I Tred to build a team around that time zone up until like East Coast time because that meant like for most days most normal work days team members had about three or four hours of overlap um in their kind of your natural kind of working day so I think that's important as well um but I think what you ultimately get to when um you focus on being more asynchronous you focus on um writing really well which means also documenting things really well is you're ultimately building a more resilient and you resilient or because you have redundancy in place right if someone is sick because you never especially in small teams right if someone is sick and they're suddenly not around for 3 weeks you better darn hope that they left breadcrumbs somewhere in different conversations that the rest of the team can pick things up like even if it's not specifically kind of you're documented right um Sops written Etc like you know that's almost moot if every if there was this Collective wisdom or knowledge that's at least there like so for two or three weeks you were without that person it might not be the easiest of times but the business won't kind of kill over um because that's not there so anyway that's but yes I mean that's personal preference right like I I think the key for me there has always been I like to work that way hence why I build my business that way and like that's why I say like you know you know at least for me being an entrepreneur was never about you know building the biggest business or making the most money it was always about the sense of Freedom the freedom to build and live a life that I you know kind of that I dream about kind you're living right yeah um and there's trade-offs in that right I'm 100% sure if you like if your dream is to ultimately IPO a business um and be CEO of that business that's a fantastic dream right but I'm sure that that comes with a lot of extra requirements that might not be for everyone or might require compromises elsewhere in how you design your life did you find that leaning into writing brought out loneliness in the culture did you have to counteract that at all yes I think um if everything is too asynchronous um it can become siloed as well so one thing that we did for example is we would do team offs sites or Retreats twice a year in person um in person for um for a week at a time um the team both converg and cogy was small enough that uh if we went somewhere we could still get like a big ass Villa yeah and all live together and and an idea around that was always just like can we you know just live together for a week um we cook together we eat together um we do activities together we just like be normal together and then there's actually not the only worky thing that we we did two work things normally on on trips like one was having a bigger round table conversation I think is better for strategic things is better in person because just easier if you can see someone around the table like those little kind of your cu's like body language where you can see like they want to say something that doesn't always translate well on Zoom um and sometimes we did a little kind of your hackathon type kind of projects between teams just to have a little bit of fun um not necessarily things that needed to be in production um at least but the the idea there of those kind of you the week we spend together um is really just about building out the relationship in person um like I don't think you know being remote and distributed is not uh you're definitely missing something if you're not spending any time in person together and it can't just be the three co-founders spend time being a person it needs to be the whole team um otherwise like culture loses a bit of a little of that oomph that brings that cohesion that collaboration the creativity that I think is always important yeah no doubt I love and like for people listening this is something I fully subscribed to as well is not over indexing on trying to cram in all the work when you do an offsite or get together it's it's got to be about the human connection I think above all else exactly I mean especially like it's so um it's almost counterintuitive right like everyone has like the I think this true for every human like we have our unique ways of working including our workstations right so now we're sudden like most of us have double screens or at least a bigger screen right and now you're somewhere in a beautiful Villa and you're sitting crouched on a kind of laptop yes you can do some important work that's necessary but you shouldn't be working kind of8 hour days at that stage like it should just be about conversations um in my opinion I love it so one of the things I admire about you is I feel like you're very clear on what you want and what you don't one out of life right like you run a company a certain way because you don't want to run it a different way even though you could have a certain kind of outcome you know I just I love that I feel like you know what you say yes to and what you say no to in a lot of situations um and I'd love to to end our podcast talking about life profitability because I feel like that's kind of the theme is is you know I don't know don't let me describe it like give the overview of what your what you were trying to convey in the book I just think it's really fitting the way you've been talking on this the precursor for life profitability was something that I uh developed my team at conversio where we described our culture as being life and family first and the the the extra bit there or expanded bit was I think we said something like uh we want to do stimulating challenging um profitable work but the most meaningful experiences that we can have are probably with people that are not our colleagues right um I like on that note I I I really dislike this idea that like your colleagues or your family or also family like no no no like we've got real families right like that's that's important anyway so there was the precursor and I think um where that evolved to was this notion um around like how do you you know build a business or a career that is life profitable meaning the work you do should create the profits for your life right um and the best quote that I could find most philosophical quote uh from Henry th he says um you know the cost of anything in life is just life itself and there's this notion that whenever we do something whether it's like concrete example build a business it's really hard to build a business um and alongside that you are committing significant costs which is often in terms of the compromise of the things you don't do in your life and for me at least is for the longest time I was very ignorant about those life costs that I incurred and the the first memory I have of this is um you know just in those kind of you days that where where wo started thriving and AD Jr was born and I think he was about 6 months old I was not ready for the unpredictability of of having a young baby in the house even though I really wanted to be a dad and my wife came to me and she said you know what you're managing your child like you would manage a team and it stuck me it like hit me right here and I was like this can't be like this and over time like I think I developed more self-awareness more clarity around what is important um and then you start tweaking things around you know what needs to be true in the business so that you make fewer of these compromises CU I don't think I'm I'm also not sure that there's some kind of Utopia where you're not making any compromises anywhere yeah but the idea there is that um the whole idea of about life profitability is um you know at least be clear about what those important parts are of your life and then make sure in the same way that you would have a Investment Portfolio that's hopefully Diversified um make sure that you kind of invest the due resources or whatever it is in all of those things um in some kind of timely manner right maybe it's maybe you can't do it on a daily basis um some things Al don't have need to be on a daily basis right like flying over here to Denver hell of a long way from Cape Town I don't need to come here on a monthly basis but two three four times a year I do need to spend time with peers yeah um otherwise my own life is lacking for example so I think it's just that the key there is like there's no right or wrong answer figuring out what that kind of Life portfolio looks like and making sure that the work we do is in support of that um I think that's the trick that's interesting yeah how do you how would you teach someone how to figure out their portfolio of life I think the easiest thing is to um to probably just cultivate this awareness around um you know what you're doing day to-day week to week at the stage um where are you spending your time um where you spending your money like those things are are normally good indicators of like what are like values or important things you're true priorities yeah yeah true priorities right because actions speak louder than words and and you might realize in some of those like well I actually spend a lot of time on this thing and it's actually it's not that important night it's more of a grudge thing um and then the second layer to that is to probably to think about energy right like um you know what what energizes versus what doesn't kind of you know energize um and then I think the kind of the the part that's I mean it's not in the book it's it's more of a recent um development on my part is you know something that I've been been working working through in the last couple of months is um your maso's hierarchy ends with self fulfillment and I think for any any entrepreneur that sold a business there's some version of self-fulfillment in there and what I've actually found is that um I'm yearning for more and I and I couldn't find an answer and then my current executive coach uh she introduced work by the black food nation or from the blackoot Nation so when maslo was working in his hierarchy um he spent a lot of time with the Blackfoot kind of your nation tribe um in Canada and their hierarchy Works slightly different which is the base level is the self fulfillment self actualization and then the next one is all about Community actualization and then the kind of the the uppermost level is cultural perpetuity and I think the what I would add to life propability at this stage is I don't think given the fact let's take a step back entrepreneurship is sometimes very much this solo player game you know we're in this for ourselves we're in this to kind of to craft this life profitable business even right to get rich do work on what we want with who we want Etc like many of these me or I things and I think I suspect um that that often leads to some disconnection with our society because ultimately you can be the richest person and if the rest of the people around you the people that often matter as well like they're not there it's just lonely yeah and I don't think success or money fixes those things so finding a way to you know Define those those kind of the the components for your own life reability relative to others and others will always have layers right like start with family friends um colleagues Etc but I think there's a greater Society to consider um but that's something that's very top of mind for me as I you know kind of again iterate on my own version of Life profitability at this stage well it's interesting it's just like what we talked about with company values right if you're saying yes to something you're saying no to something like there's an opportunity cost for every decision yes you know and I love what you said about money in particular like Dan says this all the time is money only solves money problems right like you can have all the money in the world you still could have a whole stack of problems to go along with it um if you're not feeling the self-actualization um I love it man that's a great place to leave it I appreciate your time on this this was uh this was super fun where do people go for more 80 more 80 um in the past I would have said Twitter or X um not there uh edie. me that's the blog um I'm trying to get into more blogging um love it and writing so so go there if I publish anything else on any other platform like that's a bonus right yeah that's cool I love it man well thank you so much for coming on sharing your sharing your genius with the world 80 P I appreciate it man thanks man see you
