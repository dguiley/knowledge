I'm pretty sure every other developed Nation from Canada to Norway is under at or below $10,000 per person per year in total healthare cost the best way to describe Healthcare in America is how I think some people describe San Francisco bad but [Music] expensive Dr ATA where does this podcast find you I'm at home in Austin so let's let's bust right into it yeah can you walk us through your notion of longevity specifically as it relates to lifespan and health you talk a lot about health span which speaks to Quality of Life can you break down the physical cognitive and emotional components uh to per I don't want to say prolonging life but enhancing life would that be a better way to say it yeah I think so but but also I think what I would argue is that lifespan becomes sort of an indirect benefit of pursuing Health span if you pursue Health span correctly now of course one could take that to all sorts of extremes and say well my emotional health is predicated on you know exclusively being you know with strippers on a golf course doing cocaine and that's going to enhance the quality of my life you know at that extreme yeah it probably will shorten your life but if you took a more rounded approach to improving cognitive life physical life and physical performance and emotional health yeah you're you're not only going to live a better life but I I think you're probably going to live you know 5 to 10 years longer through the mechanism of reducing the the onset of chronic disease you know I think cognitive Health people sort of understand what that is by examining what the disease States look like so the disease states which would be the diseases of dementia Alzheimer's disease vascular dementia louy body dementia these are basically conditions that deprive a person of you know some elements of and it varies by the different type of dementia but processing speed uh typically short-term memory executive function things of that nature so we all know I mean as bright as you are today Scott you know I'm sure you are not the man you were in your in your mid in terms speed and just how fasile you were and so that doesn't mean that you have a disease it simply means that as we age those processes will slow but there are things we can do to reduce that rate of Decline and then the same is true on the physical side your strength goes down flexibility goes down balance speed power all of those things will decline with age and they Peak at different points along the way so power of course is probably the first thing that we lose that tends to Peak in our early 20s where as strength Peaks later but the more we can preserve those things the more robust we'll be in our final Decades of life and then the third one is this emotional health piece which is actually the one that is not age tethered um the first two clearly are but you know the emotional health piece really speaks to many things that you know constitute happiness uh connectivity relational uh health and those things need not decline with age sometimes they do but they don't have to so taking together all of these things are kind of how I Define health span as opposed to the traditional medical definition of Health span which is the period of life in which you are free from disability and disease can you stack rank the tools of longevity uh starting with exercise which I know you believe is the most important one or that's I've interpreted your stuff can you can you give us a set of the toolkit yeah I guess I would rattle them off without ranking them to start but start with exercise nutrition sleep all the tools around emotional health and because there's so many of them I kind of bucket them into one and then the last one is the molecules so drugs hormones supplements anything that you take exogeneously so give us if you will um assume somebody doesn't have the resources the time or the disciplin to be in the top 90% of any much less all of those tell me what you think or the hacks are in terms starting with exercise whether it's avoiding doing certain things or certain you know certain investment and key things that do a great job imagine that I want to be the Old Navy of longevity and lifespan and that is Old Navy is um got to $1 billion faster than any retailer ever and the the algorithm or the strategy was genius in that is we're going to be 80% of the gap for 50% of the price how do I get 80% of what would be an elite athlete or someone in great who's really healthy for 50% of the investment maybe that's not possible but but let's see if we can do it no it it it completely is so so the Paro principle follows everything in health as well um it it helps The Listener to understand what it takes to be at the top 1% so I think that you know if you want to be at the top 1% you're going to have to do a lot of things and can you do half of those things and get 80% of the benefit you can so what would that look like I think from an exercise perspective uh and by the way everything is going to assume you're starting out at average health so if you're starting out at a huge deficit to that you know you're going to have to than potentially double down on a few things at the expense of others to get yourself out of a gap for example if a person has a significant injury that completely impairs their ability to do anything you know they're going to have to do probably more than the 50% to fix that but let's just assume we're talking about median Health individual goes after the problem from an exercise perspective I think three hours of cardio training a week um two to three hours of cardio training per week while not enough to get you on the podium at the local you know 10K is still enough to get you really significant benefits at 3 hours if you're doing two and a half of those at very low intensity but in a very specific area we call zone two so hard enough that you can talk if you need to but not so hard that you can't that would be kind of that so if you did maybe two and a half hours there and then half an hour of much more challenging intervals where you can really only hold the pace for about 4 minutes and you need about four minutes to recover so going through you know four or five sets of those once a week on the strength side I think doing three full body workouts with resistance you know with using more than your body weight three times a week 45 to 60 Minutes I would call that kind of like 50th percentile input that would probably still if done correctly and that's the devil in the detail there of course you have to be paying attention to where you are cardiovascularly in terms of energy output I think that still delivers 80% of the results for most people so just to press pause on that I I rode crew in college and it was such a traumatizing experience that I decided I never wanted my heart rate above a 100 for 30 years I just decided I'm never going to do cardio again but now I do row on a machine on an urg or a C2 whatever you call it but I only I do it three times a week and I go 2,000 m in about 8 minutes go ahead yeah I was going to say how quick did you used to go I bet you used to go 6 minutes and 30 seconds for 2K right oh I used to be you know I used to be a vein with a little bit of muscle wrapped around it I mean I could go really hard and not only that what I have found as I've gotten older is my mental toughness I wouldn't say so my mental toughness has declined I just don't want to go there just you know I used to be there was something that was drilled into me as a Young Man where I would go do Insane workouts but yeah now I'm just like I just want to be really cooked and out of breath but if I if I'm 813 versus 751 I don't care whereas before I'd be like I got to be below 7 Minutes evaluate that and that's only 24 minutes a week uh what are your thoughts about that kind of intensity versus the two or three hours you're talking about yeah I think that's great I think there's no escaping the need for building an aerobic base um again if you said to me Peter give me the 10 %c effort then yes I would direct you towards something like that right you know so there are you know types of intervals known as Tata intervals um which are interestingly enough not named after the guy who invented them basically they go as hard as they can go for 20 seconds they take 10 seconds to recover and you do that eight times for a total of four minutes and these types of workouts are touted as a really efficient way to Boost Fitness and I think for the time spent they clearly are but we shouldn't confuse those with the best way to improve Fitness and so again if you said to me Peter I'm only willing to spend 24 hours a week doing Fitness I would say that your three 2K sets a week are exceptional because you're doing upper and lower body I mean I rode for one year in uh and I can attest to just how remarkable it is and I still occasionally will get on the urg for a 2K set and um there's probably no better bang for your buck but if you're saying okay Peter I want to go to the next level then I would say great let's space that out and do some 10K sets at a lower intensity um so you know instead of averaging 2 minutes for 500 which is what you're holding there let's take it to 220 per 500 meter and build that aerobic Energy System where lactate is not getting above a certain threshold and you're really expanding your muscle capacity to oxidize fat which is essentially the sinquin of a very healthy system I've been working out three to four times a week for 40 years and I track Trends the perception or how the media or evolution of what is good for you when I was working out with weights you were seen as someone who is just Vain and might be inclined to be Arnold Schwarzenegger and take steroids and it was for vanity it wasn't for health and the way I perceived the change is that weightlifting or resistance training has been vastly underrated and it's kind of getting its time in the Sun what are your thoughts I think I think that's correct I do think it's a little misguided when folks try to pit one against the other weights versus cardio cardio versus weights obviously my answer to that is both that's sort of like saying food versus water um you know it's sort of a silly discussion um but you're you're absolutely correct that when you look at the Aging population um what most stands out is how much we see what's called sarcopenia which is defined as basically a a function a loss of muscle mass that you know puts a person at a true functional deficit that really accelerates in the eth decade of life so around 75 on average a person male or female essentially falls off a cliff in terms of how much muscle they lose and it becomes very difficult to get that back it's not impossible I've seen people who don't start training until they're at that point in their life but clearly the best strategy is to develop as much what's called physiologic headr room long before then so you know people your age and my age should be thinking about how do I build up a high enough reservoir of muscle mass so that when that gravity of sarcopenia starts pulling me down I'm at least starting at a much higher place so I'd love to know I'll give you and by the way we should have disclosed that these podcasts are just an excuse for me to talk about me I I try to have these hacks I'm on the road a lot and I'd love to know your hacks are a road War I'm on I'm only on the road about 100 days of year now it used to be 200 preo and I decided to change my life for you know relationships and just mental well-being but I'm on the road a lot and my kind of my hack is I'll be in the hotel room in about in 14 to 16 minutes I can do 25 burpees 100 push-ups 150 leg bends and then if I'm motivated I'll cash out with another 25 burpees and that's my like 16 minute get my heart going get some resistance get some you know get my muscles hurting a little bit it can a what do you think of that and B is there something if someone's on the road and just has a hotel room in their body weight and wants to like log a couple such that you know they don't fall too much before they get back into the routine what is your advice maybe a question to clarify before I respond are you Limited in that scenario by time or by being at a hotel that doesn't have um gym of some sort it's mental deficiency and that is I wake up for me I wake up and think I need to work out I need to work out and I find life gets in the way and then I find excuses not to and the clock goes fast and I end up I got 20 minutes before a business dinner and that's it usually the hotels I stay at do have gyms I just don't have the discipline to carve out always you know the hour to get in get the right clothes get down there you know I find there's a lot of transition leakage um so I like doing workouts where I'm literally I can be in my pajamas or just out of the show you know just before I get in the shower you that's one of the things I love about this is obviously benefits the wealthy you know home gym is just so powerful because I find that 60% of the time commitment is getting there and back and getting to your locker and all that but anyways no excuse other than I'm just lazy yeah so so so it sounds to me like it's less about the not having the gym it's more about the um activation energy to leave your room is the bigger hurdle which is is fine I think you got to know thyself but the only point I was going to make for folks listening is I'm very deliberate about travel I I don't have to do it as much as you anymore although I used to and you know it's probably one of the first things I would discuss with a new person coming into my life as an assistant which is how much does my travel revolve around gym quality right so it's like if I'm going to New York nothing matters to me more than the quality of the gym at the hotel I don't even care if I have to you know spend the next ex ra 20 minutes commuting to and from a meeting I absolutely care so I have in many cities I have the gym that is the gym for me but let's go back to you so so totally valid and I think this is a bit of a know thyself right so you know yourself and you're like look I'm totally willing to do 20 minutes of something in my room but if I try to Branch out more than that there's a risk nothing will happen I think what you're doing is great if I were going to add one thing to it I would probably add some sort of a jumping lunge exercise a jumping squat because everything you're doing is you're getting cardio fantastic on the burpees you're obviously getting the push-ups in you could sort of do some core work like some planks but if you threw in and it's hard for me to explain this because we're not in person but there's kind of a jumping lunge jumping squat sequence that I like to do called Mega legs where it's like you know 20 jumping squats 20 jumping split squats 20 jumping squats that kind of thing where your your legs actually get fried and your cardio system gets fried and the whole set takes like a total of two and a half minutes so that's probably the only thing that's kind of missing in yours would be sort of a more leg fatigue component the other thing you could do Scott would be some wall sits um so you could do a wall sit at the very beginning and then a wall sit at the very end again you're talking about a couple minutes on each end not adding tons of space but also doing an enormous isometric load so a lot of young people listen to the podcast I think a lot of them are stuck they do some not enough or they're worried about starting what are your sort of mental hacks or apps or tricks to just get started you know I think this is not an area that I'm an expert in but luckily there are so many experts out there and I think most of them would point to the same thing and the few times that I am trying to change a behavior I generally try to adhere to this principle which is if it's an additive Behavior so exercise is an additive Behavior usually food is a subtractive behavior um if it's an additive behavior um I start with a very small goal where participation is all that matters meaning like let's use the exercise so if a person says right now I don't exercise one bit I want to get to the point where I'm doing 30 minutes of something six days a week I would say okay how about starting with five minutes a day three days a week how about can you just get into the act of getting out of your house walk around the block for 5 minutes and come back and I'm not going to pretend that you're getting much benefit from that you aren't let's be clear but what you are doing is developing a new habit which is this is how I walk away from my computer this is how I go outside as you talked about it's the transitions that are hard and by the way once you start getting to the point where you can take five you know or three five minute walks a week it's really easy to expand both the frequency and the duration and then even what it is that you are doing I.E going from maybe walking to running on the subtractive behaviors even though I don't think that's necessarily what you asked but we might as well address it I think it all comes down to environment so and food would be the most obvious right so if if you're saying like I'm eating too much fill in the blank I think you have to accept the fact that some of us maybe have the capacity for willpower all of the time but most of us myself included do not so you know I would say you surround yourself by the foods that are the right choices and that requires much less willpower you only need to exert willpower when you're at the store buying it and you know there's some tricks like don't do that when you're hungry don't don't walk down the middle of the grocery store aisle only stay on the perimeter right so exert all of your willpower for the week in the 30 minutes it takes to stock your fridge and Pantry but then you're kind of surrounded by healthy food it makes it a lot easier so those are kind of like two call it behavioral approaches to addressing these problems let's talk about sleep uh sleep for a younger person and then sleep for people our age what are talk about the importance of it I mean something it's really people I think talk about a less than I think of the three legs of the stool is nutrition exercise and sleep and I would say sleep gets the least amount of attention talk about sleep hygiene yeah sleep's I agree with you I think it's um if your sleep is really really disrupted it's very hard to succeed even if the other two are do doing well I guess because I'm an old guy now I'm probably a bit out of touch with what the challenges are for a young person but I suspect it's probably more around kind of social stuff that you know has you wanting to maybe stay up a lot later you know we know that on average younger people drink more alcohol than older people and therefore we you know and we certainly know the impact of alcohol on sleep it's it's surprisingly bad despite the fact that it kind of makes you feel a bit drowsy and you think well that's probably helping me sleep it's completely disregulated REM sleep in particular U not to mention it also especially if you're um as you get older it's going to make you more and more likely to need to wake up to pee at night because alcohol inhibits a hormone called vasopressin which is an anti-diuretic hormone I think the other problem that is I would guess a little more prevalent with younger people is something called social jet lag so our bodies really need a circadian rhythm um and one of my good friends andreww huberman has talked a lot about the importance of kind of being exposed to light as the sun is coming up and as it is going down and how those two interactions kind of help uh normalize and anchor your circadian rhythm well imagine if you know you have a job during the week and you know you're sort of forced into regular hours but on the weekends you shift those by three or four hours because you know or partying or whatever ever um that's no different than if every weekend you took a trip you know from where I live to Hawaii right and you can imagine how how disruptive that is your sleep I'm sure with your travel you can appreciate the effect that jet lag has on Sleep Quality and how long it takes to normalize but imagine if you're doing that every single weekend um and that's sort of what social jet leg is I think for older people food and alcohol also become a little bit of an issue um but I also think that and this may be true of younger people as well I just think that our sleep hygiene is also negatively impacted by our inability to kind of detach from work and problems as we get closer to bed so I think it's very quick and easy to demonize the phone per se as this evil thing that hurts our sleep and there's a lot of Truth to that but I think the most important thing that the phone is doing to get in the way of our sleep isn't even the light that it emits it's the information that it emits and how that can be um really distressing and so you know it's one of the most important things I've done in the past couple of years is got two phones and one of them which is the work phone that is where all the distress shows up that's the one that has social media email that's the one anybody can text me on I'm kind of putting that phone away at 8:00 pm and I have another phone that is my kids call my bat phone which basically I don't know what it has on it I mean it has the app to control the TV and two other dumb thing oh it has music and podcasts and that phone is the one that if I need if I'm going to touch a phone in the evening it's that phone it's a simple hack but it creates a lot of distance between me and things that are potentially distressful before I go to bed and I think that that can sort of lead into ruminative patterns which are destructive for Sleep also so let's go back to the 8050 rule around nutrition if someone said all right I I want to get to 80% with 50% of the effort what are some best practices around nutrition yeah nutrition's a tough one because in many ways you really have to think about what are you willing to sacrifice so so two people can come to the 8050 rule very differently everybody's going to have to make some form of restrictive concession and the question then comes down to what is the one that is most easy for you to sustain so for some people that concession is going to be around some element of the diet that they're going to restrict we call that diet Ary restriction so some people are going to say well look I'm willing to give up a certain set of foods um I'm you know I'm willing to go on a lowfat diet or a low carb diet or a paleo diet or a vegan diet but I'm going to give up a subset of the entire Suite of foods and the more restrictive you make that the more you're going to be able to regulate your energy balance and where energy balance goes so too does metabolic health so if you think about it if you took any single ingredient food and said that's the only thing I'm going to eat I would be hardpressed to think you could think of a food that wouldn't end up you know regulating your body weight right like if you went on the all potato diet or the all steak diet or the you know fill in the blank all this diet um again I'm being a bit fous because you're going to run into some nutritional deficits but from an energy balance standpoint it's almost impossible to ere eat other people would come along and say no no no no no I don't want to do that I want to be restrictive around when I eat right so I had dinner with a couple of friends uh couple nights ago and one of these guys he's a buddy and he only eats one meal a day that's you know and I've done that for a couple of years as well for him it's a great way to not have to care at all about what he's eating in that one meal he's like I'm going to order as much as as I want or what of whatever I want because basically in this one meal I can largely contain myself to you know what I'm eating and um and that's how he kind of maintains his energy balance and then there's other people who want to be much more prescriptive and you know so for example if you look at bodybuilders and people who are really really needing to be perfectly regulated in how much they eat these people are tracking everything that they eat and being really restrictive around that in terms of quantity but they're giving themselves the flexibility to eat what they want and when they want provided they stay within a quantity map and we call that sort of caloric restriction so whether it be calorie restriction time restriction or dietary restriction I think a person's going to need to adopt at least one of those to some extent and the which one you adopt I think should be the one that you can most readily stick to uh okay so let's go on to I want to talk a little bit about uh mental health and I'll again I'll come back to me um I suffer from anger and depression and that's a bad news the good news is I've gotten older I recognize it and I can kind of move in on it and I have this acronym for my my means of addressing it and I call it uh scaffa SCA fa and it stands for first sweat I find immediately if I feel myself going to a dark place and I have certain metrics where I can recognize I'm going dark I immediately force myself to sweat a great deal and exercise a lot and it's that's really hard for me because when I'm feeling down that's like the last thing I want to do but I need to reset the system and sweat C for clean I try and eat at home not out I find if I eat out I just eat a lot of salt fat and that makes it the food taste good a for abstinence I don't do alcohol or edibles I'm like whatever's going on in my brain when it goes there it's probably better just without that F is for family and I that's some virtue signaling but I do generally feel a little bit more grounded and my kids are so awful sometimes they they force me to get out of my head and not be thinking about me and that I'm not feeling well and then a affection um being around my boys being in the physical presence of my dogs having my dogs literally on me as I'm watching TV I find that that mamalia that touch is very restorative for me where do I have this right what else should should I be thinking about in terms of my own mental health well again you know Scott I I don't I don't pretend to have any um real domain expertise here so the only thing I would say is look if that is working that sounds fantastic there's certainly nothing there that you've said that doesn't sound healthy are there other things that one could consider absolutely right so one could consider therapy as well um in my experience you want to have therapy as an ongoing thing and not just a crisis thing and that allows it to be more effective during the crisis um so I've had a particularly difficult seven months for reasons I'm still sort of trying to understand and it I find it really in interesting as I look back because I can kind of reflect and say wow there was this six-month period where everything seemed really good and then there was this six-month period where you were in such an awful place and you were so dymic but it was really nice for me to be able to have that discussion with people who had known me for years and who I speak with every week and therefore they have a perspective I might be missing so that's not something that necessarily can help a person today if they're having this for the first time but that could be an encouragement to take mental health more seriously as a proactive Health step not just a reactive step I think another thing for me that is really productive is journaling and I I I'm not a regular journaler in other words I don't say every day I have to journal but when I am in a place that is suboptimal which I find myself in quite often um the pen really helps I don't know that everybody's like that but I think there are some of us who process information when they can write it down and it forces us to Think Through through things a little bit so those would be just a couple of other things that one could add to the list I also think for me personally being outdoors is a wildly important part of getting better so regardless of the circumstances I'm always trying to be outside every day but in in particular when I'm struggling uh like I do this thing called rucking that I love and it's a you know so walking around with a heavy backpack huge form of y we'll be right back and you I mean you you're pretty transparent around your own struggles with mental health in your book how does it manifest in your life like from the outside Peter you look like you're just killing it I you look like if this guy can't be happy I mean you look as if your life is just I'm seeing you everywhere you look like you're in amazing shape from an outsider standpoint it looks like youve just got it you're you're just doing so well what are your own means of identifying when you're struggling and are do you have any immediate go-tos yeah there are lots of signs this is a very important part I think of therapy is understanding what the yellow light behaviors are as as as we call them um so what are the warning signs that things are that things are Brewing that I have to start paying attention to and this is probably been the single most important change in my life in the last five years is I I used to really worry Scott that I was just the space subtle Challenger or you know just a disaster that was going to happen with no warning because disasters were happening right every you know couple of years there would be an enormous meltdown that was just a you know would basically nearly ruin my life and that of anyone within the vicinity but let's just press press pause there a financial meltdown lashing out at people important to you going into a dark place yeah you know fortunately not Financial um it it it could usually be some incredibly self-destructive behavior that would harm many people it could be um an unbelievable lash out that like I mean literally like road rage that could almost result in me killing somebody physically um it could be an incredible professional blowup um so just you know things that are really kind of I think sort of rooted in Anger yeah at least four if not Six Sigma events with respect to really destructive behavior and I began to just sort of accept the narrative that I'm like Mount vvus like you you don't know when that thing's going to go off like it's just it's an awful thing and it's it's really bad for these poor people down there but like don't live near a volcano I don't know what to tell you right and I I've I I over time and with an insane amount of therapy began to realize that that's actually a false narrative that's not true at all the warning signs are all over the place I just wasn't looking for them I wasn't attuned to them and there are six months of smoke coming out of that volcano and there are 6 months of small cracks that were moving and the ground was slightly shaking I just didn't have the instrument to pick those up and if I did it's actually better than a volcano because the answer isn't move everybody away and let it erupt the answer is no let's fix the root of the problem and prevent the eruption and so that's where I really tend to spend a lot of my time now is on focusing on that and by the way I think a big part of that is accepting the fact that dymia and anadon are not horrible they're not horrible feelings they're there to tell us something right if you feel this way there's a reason emotions are not accidents they are forcing you to confront a why and that's that that that insight has been one of the most important insights in my life because I no longer spiral deeper into the despair when I'm feeling the despair now I say why am I feeling this way where is the disconnect and it's usually a disconnect between something in my behavior and something in my values so there's a way I want to live and there's a way I am living and if those are not collinear I start to feel bad and now I'm able to reconcile that quicker not immediately but now I can say oh you're feeling bad because you're actually working too hard right now and you're not spending as much time with your family as you want to and that is the thing that is gnawing away at you and that's what's making you irritable with everybody right now and realizing it when it's just that is a lot easier than absolutely blowing up and ravaging everything in your life what are your observations around addiction or being on this hamster on money for young people that are successful I if you thought through your own your own ability to try and balance that tension and the impact it has on you and the people around you I I think about this a lot and I I do think that most of us are addicts uh the question is what are we addicted to and um I tend to not worry so much about what the label is what I tend to really ask myself is is the behavior adaptive or is it you know sort of bleeding into maladaptive and I think to answer that question again you have to really have a clear sense of what your values are and believe me like there's nobody that hates the word values in a sort of corporate sense more than I do I think that's just such hokey nonsense what I mean is and it can be substituted for any other words is like what is your eulogy going to say right that's that's really more what I'm referring to and I've been to too many funerals and I've thought deeply about this and I came to the realization probably later in life than I wish that I don't think I care what anybody thinks of me beyond my family and my friends and the good news is the more I practice that the easier it is now I've had to make some concessions around that meaning like if I sat there and scrolled through Twitter to see what people said about me I wouldn't be able to live that way but I will tell you this I don't know the last time I looked at a comment about me on Twitter it's been 9 to 12 it's probably been a year there could be people telling me I'm the greatest person in the world on Twitter I wouldn't know it and there's obviously lots of people telling me I'm the worst person on Twitter so so you know not reading comments not looking in the mirror effectively um is probably a valuable way to do that and um kind of realizing like who matters to me and who doesn't and on the work front I think this is this is challenging because a person in your situation can easily say when confronted with hey do you think you might be doing this a little too much well what do you want me to do do nothing um and the truth of it is no that's not it at all um and I think work is really important regardless of how much money you have like having a purpose really matters and for many people that sense of purpose is tied to a job not for all people right for some people it it can be tied to to something that isn't earning money but for many of us it is and I think the real challenge there is playing that game of at the end of my life will I be looking back wishing I dialed this down or up and I struggle with this more than anything so this is still the greatest struggle of my life and I think it's a big part of you know the past six months for me personally has been thinking of why do I work so hard when none of this really matters in the grand scheme of things right like my this is a very remarkable period of time when my kids are still young and like why why would I even consider missing a day of this how old are your kids uh 15 n and six okay so you still have some gold in yours left um I I have to bring this up because I'm fascinated by it I wrote a post that got a lot of attention and I basically said that glp1 will be bigger than gp4 and and when I think about milin says $1.7 trillion do a year in obesity related costs when I see the research that this isn't an appetite suppressant it's a craving suppressant I think we may have found scaffolding for our instincts that brings our instincts up to institutional production and 42% of America obese 70% obese overweight 70% of America isn't anything and I I'm just sort of Blown Away I mean the economic incentives to just get keep us getting fatter and fatter seems so extraordinary to me and if we can go thinner and thinner the impact on the economy is going to be enormous so one I I don't know if you've thought about the E the economic impact to me just seems staggering and two I know that you have highlighted that there's no free lunch here that there is some downside so one do you do you buy the notion that this is going to have as big an impact as at least I I I hypothesize and two talk about the tradeoffs of a of a gp1 drug well um you know I thought about it a lot Scott after I heard the the the episode epis of of real time and um because I hadn't thought of it in those terms and I think as an economist that's an interesting way to think about it right which is look we can really quantify the cost of weight right like we can we can actually quantify that and by extension we certainly have enough clinical trial data to look at both semaglutide and tepati and talk about their impact on weight so I actually think there's a clear consideration and I think one thing that you didn't consider in the analysis was the cost of the drug so we have to ask the question right now when you factor in the cost of buying the drug at the current prices assuming these companies don't dramatically lower the prices how does that change the calculus I don't know if you've done that yet but the problem with these drugs today is they are comically expensive I mean they make pcsk9 Inhibitors look like Tic Tacs you know at some point that cost is borne either by the system when the insurance company pays for it and then every everybody is subsidizing it or the individual and I do wonder if at the moment we're just seeing the tip of the spear where the wealthy can afford it because it's a rounding error for the wealthy to spend probably God it's probably $16,000 a year is the cost of this drug so you know for a wealthy person that's a pittance um but the moment you say no no no that needs to be borne by insurance which you know is really only paying for that at the most extreme levels of obesity or type two diabetes um how would you trickle that down to 70% of the population is basically my question and how does that change the calculation then you get into the um tradeoffs which is in my if I was guessing I would say that there are trade-offs to every drug or most drugs and the question becomes at what threshold do you draw the line where cost physical cost harm exceeds benefit so we can easily talk about the people for whom OIC or tepati makes sense um meaning yeah maybe there's a small risk of increased in you know an increase in cancer down the line or the one thing that I've talked about a lot is we see every patient that's been on it has their heart rate go up 10 beats per minute I mean across the board um don't know what that's from I assume that's a change in sympathetic and parasympathetic tone but it's in the wrong direction so it's hard to believe that that's long-term healthy but it's also potentially not as bad compared to the long-term harm of a person carrying 70 extra pounds but at what point does that trade-off flip in the other direction and you I don't know what that is yet and we're not going to know that until there's more data you then have touched on the issue which has been reported although I haven't seen clinical trials demonstrating this yet I've seen this only as reports which is that the effect probably of the gp1 but it could be the Gip as well um is is on the on the regulation of pleasure and therefore if it's turning down pleasure whether it be from food or some other uh molecule such as alcohol then you know we've potentially hit on something even bigger and more important than just an obesity drug so I think all of this is to say um it's early days and I just hope that people out there are willing to invest in the right kind of studies to answer these questions again some of them that we can be answering in short-term studies like the behavioral stuff but some of which are only going to be done over long-term studies where we can really look at safety and other consequences and then lastly um I think the economic model of this is just still a little bit broken I I think that the US drug pricing model is a is a badly broken system um and I could go on for hours about that but but I think we we we're going to have to address that just to put that in perspective by the way for people listening who don't these numbers sound a bit funny you know I I don't think there's another developed Nation you might know this guy I don't think there's another developed Nation out there that spends more than about $10,000 per person per year in Total Health Care and if there is it's not going to be that much more right it might be that it's you know $122,000 per year per person but I'm pretty sure every other developed Nation from Canada to Norway is under at or below $10,000 per person per year in Total Health Care cost so when you have a drug that costs $16,000 plus dollars that you're going to need to be on for the rest of your life because we know as sure as God made little green apples when you come off this drug the weight comes back um we have to figure out that part of the equation as well the best way to describe Healthcare in America is how I think some people describe San Francisco bad but expensive um you've been very generous of your time last question as someone who's you you've been successful what advice would you have to your 25-year-old self that's tough um I don't know that my 25-year old self would have listened to anything the 50-year-old is saying but if I could have really convinced him and maybe put him on some MDMA and got him in a really empathetic State um I would have said now is a good time to start figuring out yourself don't wait until there's a crisis um so be proactive in your approach to emotional and mental health um just just as you have been at the time I had been very proactive with respect to my health in all other ways um and I think it's very cliche and it's not for everybody but I really believe there's something to be said for being a father and I can't imagine what my life would be like if I didn't have a family and again it just sounds like such a dumb thing to say CU it's so cliche but I think if you're a dad you would agree with this so maybe those listening to to this who aren't would find it silly there is nothing I have accomplished in my life or will accomplish in my life that I am going to be more proud of when it's over than my family because I know how hard it has been and how unnatural it has been at times and how much sacrifice it takes and yet how rewarding it is so I I know that the trends are that people are having less kids and you know people are more reluctant to to start families but I would say that uh it is the most rewarding thing that I can imagine doing Dr Peter ATA as the founder of early medical a medical practice with the goal of lengthening patients lifespan and simultaneously improving their health span he previously spent two years at the National Institutes of Health as a Surgical Oncology fellow at the National Cancer Institute where his research focused on immune-based therapies for melanoma he's also the host of the drive and the author of the number one New York Times bestseller outlive the science and art of longevity joins us from Austin uh doctor as you are going through that analysis of the trade-offs in your life and wondering whether it's worth it you do need to add in on the credit side you're having an enormously positive impact on people I think a lot of young people are thinking about health earlier that wouldn't have otherwise had they not seen your content you're so outstanding at distilling down this information and people look at you and they want to be you so I hope that you I hope that's part of your Calculus and we really appreciate your time today thank you so much Scot it's been a great honor to sit with [Music] you
