# The 1 Million Landing Page

Published: 2025-10-11

If there is one thing that I've learned over the last 20 years of scaling multiple companies, it's this. Everything is downstream from lead generation. If you can generate leads, you can solve all the other problems after that. But if you cannot generate leads, you are dead in the water. And today, I want to share with you my multi-million dollar lead generation system that has worked on agencies, software companies, education and training, coaching, consulting, and a range of other businesses that I've been involved with. Every single time I take on board a new business project, I start by setting up one of these online assessments that just generates leads. And off the back of the consistent results that these get, we can scale up from there. And it's going to totally transform the number and the quality of clients that come through your business's front door. So, let's get started on how to set up an online assessment that creates leads like nobody's business. Step one for creating an online assessment is to create a landing page that really explains to people what the online assessment is going to do for them. Why would they take an online assessment? The first part of the landing page is the top of the landing page. This is the first thing people see when they're scrolling through their phone. Now, they arrive at this landing page and it has either one of two hooks. Hook number one is called a frustration hook. A frustration hook names the frustration that people are experiencing. So, it could be feeling frustrated that you're not getting the fitness results that you want even though you work out every week. Feeling frustrated that you're not getting investment returns even though you invest consistently every month. Feeling frustrated that you have not been able to scale up your marketing even though you're willing to invest in ads. Right? So, anything that is the frustration, feeling frustrated that blank happens even though you're doing this very powerful frustration hook. The second one is a results hook. And the way I like to do a results hook is a readiness sentence. Are you ready to run your first marathon? Are you ready to have the relationship of your dreams? Are you ready to protect your business from a cyber security threat? Right? So, anything that you can help people get as a result, if you ask people, are they ready for that result? They're going to say, "Oh, I'm not sure if I'm ready. I want to take this assessment to find out." Now, the subheading of the hook says, "Answer 15 questions to find out why you're experiencing this frustration and what to do about it." So the subheading directs people to take the assessment, answer 15 questions so they can find out if they're ready or if they can deal with this frustration. So the next part of the landing page is called the value proposition. The way to do a value proposition is to tell people to take this assessment so that we can measure and improve three key areas. So let's say you're doing a sleep assessment. Are you ready to get 7 hours or more of really high quality deep sleep? You would then have the value proposition. Answer these 15 questions so that we can measure and improve your sleep environment, your sleep routine, and your sleep nutrition or whatever it is. So, you're going to give people a value proposition. You're going to say, "We're going to measure and improve three key things, and you're going to list those three things, and those are going to be three things that people would love to achieve along the way to a better result." So, that's the value proposition. When people hear a powerful hook and a good value proposition, they immediately want to know whether it's credible. It sounds almost too good to be true. So they want to know who are you? What's your background? What research have you done? So under the credibility section, we need to say who created this which is you and your bio. What have you done in the past? So what's your background and the research that you've done? So you might be able to quote some statistics, some figures. You might be able to say 85% of people struggle with X, Y, and Zed. You might be able to say a recent Harvard University study found that 15% of people are achieving X, Y, and Zed. This number could be dramatically improved, right? So, who are you? What have you done in the past? What research have you done in order to create this assessment? Then the final thing is called a call to action, a CTA. And a call to action, what we want to do here is a really powerful call to action. And we want to cover a few key things here. We want to say start the quiz cuz that's the next step. It only takes 3 minutes to complete. It's completely free. and you get immediate recommendations on how you can improve. That combination is very powerful as a call to action. Now, if you get this right, you will have 20 to 40% of people who hit that landing page going ahead and starting the quiz. And that is going to be a massive lead generator for you. So, part two of this online assessment lead generation strategy is the quiz questions. This is where we're going to find out a lot of information about every single person who's signaling interest for you. Now, this questionnaire is actually going to have three parts to it. Part one is where you're going to ask them their name, their email address automatically. We're going to get their location because of their IP address. And you're going to give them the opportunity to enter their phone number, but you're not going to make it mandatory to do that. So, the two things they have to enter in order to start the quiz is their name and their email address. The location will be picked up by the system, and the phone number will be optional. So, the contact information is the first things that we want to capture. Then we want to go into the first 10 questions. Now these 10 questions, we're going to call these the best practices questions. So the best practices questions is we're going to ask people if they're doing 10 things that they should be doing. So if this scorecard was about uh sleep, we might ask them if they get to bed on time at the same time, if they're using too many screens before bed. If this assessment was about health and fitness and losing weight, do they track their calories? Do they work out three or four times a week? Whatever you consider to be the best practices, you're going to ask them 10 questions that allude to how many of these best practices they've been able to say yes to or no to. And that's what's going to give them their score, which we'll get to soon. So, you've got to come up with 10 best practices that you think people should be doing if they're doing all the right things, and that's going to inform the score. But now, we're going to add five more questions that are going to be really powerful questions for you to be able to make more sales. So, here's the big five questions that I want you to ask that allow you to qualify your leads and make more sales. Question number one is which best describes your current situation. So, you might give people uh four or five options to choose from. I'm a student. Uh I'm in my first 5 years of my career. Uh I'm a manager. I'm a senior leader. I'm an executive. Or uh I've never run a marathon before. Uh I've run one to three marathons. I'm a seasoned marathon runner. Whatever is their current situation, you want to know how they describe it. The next question is which describes your desired outcome that you would like to achieve in the next 90 days. And then you give them a list of things that they want to achieve in the next 90 days. And ask them which is the most important desired outcome for you to achieve in the next 90 days. That gives them the opportunity to tell you what is the number one thing that's driving their decisions. They might say, "I want to lose weight or I want to achieve my first 7 hours worth of deep sleep." Right? whatever it is, they're going to say that's the outcome that I want in the next 90 days. Question number three is, what is the obstacle that you think is stopping you? Or what have you tried that hasn't worked in the past? And you'll give them a list of three or four things to choose from so they can select what they think is the biggest obstacle to their success. The fourth question is, which solution do you think would suit you best? And you could say, I want uh education and training. I want one-to-one coaching. Uh I want software. Uh, I want someone to do it all for me. Right? So, you can give them some potential solutions. Now, the benefit of this question is that it implies what they're willing to spend. Someone who only wants a book is probably going to spend $10 or $20. Someone who says, "I want it all done for me," they're probably thinking $10,000 to $20,000. So, the solution that people have in mind will tell you a little bit about their budget that they have in mind. And the fifth question is, "Is there anything else that you think we need to know about?" Now, this is an openbox question and it allows them to type anything into the box that they want. And the craziest thing is that a lot of times people will tell you what's driving their decision or they'll tell you useful information that helps you to make a sale. I've had people put into that box, uh, I've already read your book and I want to get started or I have a budget but I have to spend it by the end of the month. Right? Incredible stuff that people will put into that box that is incredibly helpful. If they've answered all of those 14 other questions, they're going to give you some really good relevant information if they fill in that question as well. So those are the 15 questions that we want people to answer. And when they do that, we can give them what we call their dynamic results. So the reason we call it dynamic results is because this entire results page can completely change depending on how they answered the questions. So for example, we could have a little speedometer here that tells people how they performed. You got a 75% out of 100%. We could have a thermometer that tells people that they're cold, warm, or hot. Right? So we could put anything we want here as a result. And we can tell people, "Congratulations, you scored really well." We could say, "Oh, no. You've got a lot of room to improve." We could say, "Well done. You've got strong foundations, but plenty of room to improve." We can change the content that goes here depending on how people answered the questions. So, here's what we want to have. Number one, we want to have the big reveal. So, the big reveal is the overall result. This is how you did in general. Then, we want to have three insights. So as a result of how you answered the question, what are three things that I want you to know? Then finally, we want to have some next steps. Uh and those next steps would be completely different depending upon how people answered the questions. If someone's answered the questions in a way that's highly qualified, you might want to offer them a one-to-one meeting. If someone is somewhere in the middle, you might want to offer them a group presentation, a group event. Maybe if someone has answered the question so that you know that they are absolutely wrong for your business, you may just want to give them some content. So you might send them to a video episode or a podcast episode or you might recommend a book. But this can change depending on how people answer the questions. And then finally down the bottom you want to have all your contact information, maybe your social media links and all of that sort of stuff so that if people want to bounce around off that page, they can leave that open but they can also open up other pages. So you definitely want to have your website there as well. So this basically is a end to-end system where they discover that there is an assessment. They then answer 15 questions and then they get their dynamic results with specialized next steps based on how they answered those questions. This is incredibly powerful because you can see the quality of the leads that come in. When this captures all of the leads, you actually get to see how people answered all the questions. You can see how they scored. You can see where they are. You can see whether they've put real contact information in. You can see the recommended next step. It's all laid out in the dashboard for you. It's incredible. Now, this entire system might seem like it's an incredibly difficult and complex system to set up, but it's all completely automated for you at scoreapp.com. I'm the co-founder of that software company, and I've put all of my best thinking into one place. We've got 150 templates that are based on this strategy. We've got a downloadable book called Scorecard Marketing. We've got online courses that explain exactly how to do it. And we've got an amazing customer success team that will just get on a call with you and help you to set this up. It could not possibly be easier. In fact, most people get set up in about 10, 20, 30 minutes and then they're ready to go. Either way, the juice is worth the squeeze because this thing produces so many high-quality leads. So, there'll be a link in the description below so you can get set up on scoreapp.com as well. So, the one question that everyone asks me once they see this system is, "How do I send people to this landing page? How do I get more clicks? How do I get more conversions? How do I send paid traffic? How do I send organic traffic to this landing page?" So, let me tell you, I've just created a video before this one that answers that exact question. I'm going to link to that video in the description below, and that video talks exactly step by step how to start small and then scale big for getting attention into landing page traffic. So, you're going to see the link to that video in the description below. As I said at the beginning, everything is downstream from lead generation. If you can master lead generation, everything else comes off the back of that. You'll be able to get more sales. You'll be able to hire the right people. You'll be able to scale your business if you can get this lead generation sorted once and for all. I hope you've enjoyed this video and I hope your business is successful.
