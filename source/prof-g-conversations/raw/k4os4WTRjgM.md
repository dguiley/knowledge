p is certainly on the extreme right taale of risk taking where he literally said in repeated interviews that if he could push a button and gamble for the future of the universe and either the universe is destroyed or 51% of the time it winds up being twice as good then it's a positive expected value bet so he'd make it that's a pretty insane way to look at life and I I think people were too unwilling I think there was a little bit of a kind of boy Genius myth around Sam [Music] Nate where does this podcast find you at home in New York Manhattan you live in the city where do you live in the city what would charitably be called Chelsea kind of by Penn Station Madison Square Garden basically so let's talk about your new book on the edge the art of risking everything you investigate the river the community of like-minded people whose Mastery of risk alow them to shape and dominate so much of our modern world can you explain what you mean by the river so I have a very kind of geographic mind I like a good Geographic memory and I like looking at maps and things like that so I kind of wanted to create a metaphorical plays where a certain type of person lives and this type of person has two basically defining characteristics one is that they're super analytical they're kind of in the Moneyball math nerd tradition for the most part so they're playing poker or um founding companies or things like that uh the other is that they're extremely insanely competitive um which which makes them really risk-taking for the most part they want to win they want to prove things to themselves and other people um they aren't afraid to stand out they can be contrarian to the point of sometimes being more than a bit annoying I think but I kept finding the same personality type and all the different fields that I cover I mean I kind of started in the world of Poker I actually have a background as professional poker player but if you talk to people in Silicon Valley or um people trading crypto or people Sports bets or even the effective altruist who we'll talk to a little bit later and the AI people they all have this kind of same competitive nerd analytical personality in mind they speak the same language and so um and it's a small community the river is a community of mostly successful Elites I guess you'd call them and you know you go to Silicon Valley it's like kind of a small world still it's not it's not sprawling through thousands of people the top VC firms might have a dozen Partners or something but not not hundreds and so and so it there's more Community than I would have thought and you've seen that Community have a rivalry more and more with this other community I call the Village and talk about the distinction between folks in the river and folks in the village yeah so the village is basically um if you think of it as kind of New York Boston Washington maybe except for like Wall Street so it's like government media and Academia so the kind of Quint Central River uh Village rather institutions are like Harvard University and the New York Times so it's politically Progressive for the most part as compared to the river it's much less Analytical in fact it's very concerned about social status and social appearances the ultimate punishment in the village is to be ostracized or I suppose cancel that's BEC a little bit outmoded um and it's it's risk averse um it's kind of neurotic it was much more cautious during Co it's afraid of offending people and uh and there's a rivalry between these two communities increasing when you see things like I guess it was last year maybe in January when you see like hedge fund investors attacking like University presidents who are speaking before Congress that's an open conflict I would say when you see people um in Silicon Valley kind of going more to war with like the Democratic party establishment we're actually seeing this kind of play out more and more I mean I'm I'm Loosely the words that come into my mind are kind of libertarian versus establishment is that fair I think the river would Champion itself as kind of lowercase L libertarian um and would Champion itself as being apolitical but of course it's often hypocritical people go from being apolitical to being like Elon Musk where you're very politically charged up on a lot of issues I mean if you did a survey of the people I call ravarian they'd probably be 3 to2 Democratic before Republicans still or two to one maybe it's I mean most communities of Elites today where you have high educational credentials tend to be Democrats in the United States but but it's notably more varied than the village which is kind of uniformly 95% blue Democratic Progressive talk about what sort of what you think are the key Habits of Highly Effective Risk Takers that you talk about in your book there's a list of 13 of these in the book and they kind of fall somewhat into personality characteristics and somewhat into psychological characteristics um from a psychological standpoint some degree of Detachment um where you're focused on process and not results if you play a poker hand you can play the hand perfectly and if your opponent makes her flush draw you're still going to lose that hand a third of the time that process orientation I think is counterintuitive for most people personality wise some of it does come down to you know simply being willing to take risks and being courageous maybe the single most important defining characteristic is being cool under pressure in most walks of life higher Stakes moments vastly outweigh the day-to-day if you do make it deep in a poker tournament playing for you know a million dollar first prize it's more important by a factor of 1000x than your you know Tuesday night beer league game for example learning how to handle pressure is important I mean I did like I said talk to mostly people who are doing analytic math oriented things but I also talked to an astronaut an Explorer um a military commander people like this and I heard some of the same things over and over one thing I heard a lot is don't try to be a hero when you're under pressure when you're like literally in outer space and some red light is blinking trusting the process uh following um protocol that kind of frees up bandwidth for dealing with an emergency versus just like winging it so it's a lot of preparation and experience and coolness Under Fire it's interesting because well the the way I would try and translate that to entrepreneurship is I don't think I'd be nearly as good an entrepreneur now as I was when I was a younger man because when I was a younger man I had a bit of sociopathy in the sense that it should could be awful around me in my business and we were running out of funding and I'd be stressed but I would still be able to sleep at night I just didn't I didn't I was almost sort of sleepwalking through life and didn't and now I'm I'm too anxious I'm too kind of concerned about the downside do you think there's any truth to that for sure I think it's not a coincidence that that more Founders are younger although there's probably some stereotyping that takes place some of you sees poker players are often younger too despite it being game that it takes a lifetime to master that's partly also a matter of physical fitness I think but yeah the ability to like shut out distractions and be really focused is really hard and Maybe not maybe not entirely healthy sometimes either but yeah as you gain more responsibilities right so I played as I do most years I went to the World Series of Poker this year and played but it's an election year I have The Spook coming out so there were like constant distractions and it was in my best interest to manage those right I can write newsletter posts and gain subscribers or book interviews and and publicity for the book but still yeah part of what comes with being an adult I think is you have a little bit more to lose that can make you more risk averse you have more responsibilities and that can be okay but if you're a VC trying to invest in a Founder you want a Founder who has kind of literally insane single-minded Focus maybe for a period of 10 years whatever Runway period that you have and that might be a younger person's game most thought people are Risk Takers and are successful are good at taking smart risks in other words to a certain extent the risks they take uh have a much they do the analysis and go there's a greater upside here that you know a one in betting on a team that has a 50 to1 chance get you get 50 to1 odds seems like crazy risk but if you actually done the analysis and say the likelihood is more like 30 to1 that's a good risk how would you coach young people around how they approach risk I think probably 90% of people of course it you a probability I think probably 90% of people could stand to be more risk-taking um at least in terms of like their career lives I'm not saying oh go do drugs or something like that that's a personal choice you know look we have a lot of evolutionary training where we don't live in this kind of world of abundance that we do now where we don't have as much of a safety net if you fail and where there was less of a reward for taking risk you go out and get some infection or something and there's no cure for it and you die and now we're in a world of abundance and we can afford to think more in terms of expected value which means kind of what is the outcome you get on average when trying this thing because there's uncertainties in the world if you play poker then some percentage of time you're going to win the tournament more often than not you bust out but are you making is it a plus EV positive expected value gamble on average now if you're a founder and you're making these long prolonged 10year bets then maybe it's a little bit different right I mean the kind of brilliant thing that Venture capitalists do is gather together all these Founders who are making long shot Bets with probably positive expected value but many of them will fail if you make enough of those bets then you're kind of guaranteed to to do very well for yourself right enough of them will pay off and a you have a fund of 15 or 20 or 25 companies every year then sooner and you have your pick of the lit you're picking the best Founders then that's a very good business for a Founder it requires I mean I think it Lally does require more risk I mean if you are any one founder your company May Fail um which is partly why you know you get people like Elon Musk who like literally if you read the um the Isaacson book on him about Elon playing poker he would like literally just kind of go in go all in every hand until he lose and he walk away from the table and do something else um he's in that 10% group where he's probably taking on too much risk I would think but these are often people that have chips on their shoulder that almost have like an evolutionary or genetic kind of propensity to take risk yeah I wonder if they're to a certain extent I'm not talking about mus but they have they're addicts in the sense that they take risk and the new kind of the new dopamine balance um after taking some risk is to have that rush you have to take more risk I used to I worked for a hedge fund manager who at one point was the I don't know I think the 50th or the 70th wealthiest person and he kept taking these just outsize crazy risks in until he ended up broke and he just has like almost a psychotic approach or aggressive approach um to risk I want to bring it down to entrepreneurship because I've been an entrepreneur for most of my life and have raised a lot of money from VCS and where I thought there was a bit of a disconnect or dislocation between their interest and my interest is that they would always encourage me as the CEO or the founder of a company when it was going well to go bigger harder bolder because they're looking for they're looking for billion dollar exits to pay for the 70 or you know 80% of their portfolio that doesn't even get its money back and you know half of them that go to zero and they need those big pops and I was thought okay I don't need to be a billionaire I need to have Economic Security and this is where our interest diverge because I used to advocate for and usually would ultimately would win for selling the company I sold my first company for 33 million our investors were disappointed I sold my last company for 160 million despite my investors tripling their money in 27 months they were disappointed because I didn't have a bunch of chips on the table I had one big chip on one number and so it creates a Divergence and risk can you talk a little bit about where you know are there other divergences whether it's an employee and your you know of a company or an entrepreneur or founder in VCS how do you want to be thinking about an approach to risk based on where you are in an organization no Scott I think that's right and I think kind of VCS get the better side of that VC founder interaction most of the time um and it's partly why they're picking people who have huge variance in their outcomes right you're not going to pick somebody to run like a chain of three ice cream stores and Boise Idaho or something right where the upside is capped you want people that wind up on the extreme Tales because the thing you hear over and over and over again from in Silicon Valley is like you can't miss out on the 1,000x Xing your money opportunity you cannot let Mark Zuckerberg walk through the door so the downside of that is you sometimes get a Mark Zuckerberg and sometimes you get a Sam bakman freed or Elizabeth Holmes or or whatever else I mean even in my own world um you know I kind of run I guess my own content business and and realizing that it's actually a much better business where it's smaller scale right I keep more of the profit myself I don't have a bunch of employees whose marginal contribution can be debated I suppose and so yeah I found that when I'm smaller I actually am happier and more successful financially but the obsession with scale especially in the media business which is maybe its own special beast but the obsession with scale makes sense in most context from a VC standpoint but may not be in the interest of of the founder in terms of your own personal life and risk-taking I've always bifurcated it and it may be incorrect but again just trying to reverse engineer this into actional advice for young people there was my risk Prof file before kids and then after kids and I left Investment Banking which on a risk adjusted basis was what I should have stuck with but I wasn't enjoying it and I wasn't very good at it and then I moved home with my mom because I'm like oh I'll just I don't know what I'm going to do and not knowing what you want to do and quitting doesn't pay well so I moved back in with my mom and I took risks and I applied to graduate school started businesses my first business I didn't have any money but my girlfriend was making money so I could I could take that risk once I had kids it and I think this is the correct Instinct I'm like okay just got real my you know me and my my two sons can't move back in with my mom or it's going to be very uncomfortable and it absolutely changed my risk profile a lot more anxiety a lot more concern around risk but I think that was the correct emotion would you describe other other seminal moments in your life do you want to think about risk before and after and doesn't this all add up to when you're young is the time to take risks I think so I mean I I don't have kids and so that's like one more reason to kind of gamble on your upside and not necessarily worry about a secure paycheck I don't think yeah I think that heuristic is basically right that when you're younger you have more opportunity I mean look I think people sometimes set the bar too low as far as life outcomes that they're satisfied with because my first job out of college I had a consulting job I was something called a transfer pricing consultant which is about as boring as it sounds like and and quit that to play online poker basically where I was making more money and to work for a um internet startup that wrote about baseball statistics so quitting a safe consulting job is a somewhat risky Endeavor but it proved to be a better decision and I but I I think people need to have a higher reserve price to use a slightly technical term for for how they're spending their time there's also studies I mean Stephen levit of fre economics did a famous paper where he would actually have people literally flip coins to make major life decisions so should I move across the country or quit my job or get divorced or get married um and found that when people flipped a coin they told them to make a change they wound up being happier on average the importance of quitting I don't if you had Annie Duke on the show former poker player um who now writes business books um wrote a book called quit getting out of a bad situation while you can or maybe you know half a move ahead is an underrated skill I think I think people are too willing to muddle through not have a long enough time Horizon and wind up being mired in an unhappy place I think that's a a great Insight I just want to stop on that there's this mythology from Donald Trump down like never give up oh there's a time to give up I mean absolutely there's a time to leave and I always say that's where a kitchen cabinet comes in to advise you that okay you're banging your head against a wall you need to move on to different opportunities several chapters of your book focus on S bankman freed in the crypto world what do you think people about FTX and S bankman freed and how it relates to risk so he is certainly on the extreme right tale of risk-taking where he literally said in repeated interviews that if he could push a button and gamble for the future of the universe and either the universe is destroyed or 51% of the time it winds up being twice as good then it's a positive expected value bet so he'd make it that's a pretty insane way to look at life and I I think people were too unwilling I think there was a little bit of a kind of boy Genius myth around Sam and there was a little bit of a bystander problem where it seemed like all these people are vouching for him therefore he must be smart and therefore people weren't willing to point out sometimes crazy and cooky things that he was willing to say and it's a little bit of a cult of personality the cult that the village or the river would think it avoids it actually winds up having with Founders like SPF sometimes I think he was also not a very good risk assessor despite thinking of himself as was one you know I talked to um a lawyer right has his criminal trial in Manhattan was taking place um and the lawyer said he should not take the stand he should cut his losses um and try to minimize his sentence at at five to 10 years if he takes a stand he's for sure G to perger himself which he did and he wound up getting like 20 years instead um when I talked to Sam and Palo Alto you know six months before the trial I said what if you were offered a two-year plea deal two years and then uh then some restrictions on what you can do afterwards so kind of more than a slap on the wrist but not that much more and he said I'd have to think about it right so I mean he was 10x off of what the realistic outcome was going to be he got 20 years of course and I think I think look as a poker player I've seen lots of people in the S SPF typology so kind of smart nerdy maybe a little bit on the Spectrum you know neurotic Aderall whatever um quick on his feet um and not all of them are as smart as they're cracked up to be so I think people needed to have more skepticism of him both kind of before during and and after the bankruptcy I would argue that's a perfect example of just ridiculously stupid risk-taking I I can't imagine how frustrated his lawyers must have been like okay you are doing everything wrong here I'm curious have you tried to have you tried to relate some of your thoughts and Analysis around risk-taking to people's relationships or personal life you said you don't have kids I don't know if you're in a partnership but have you thought about approach to risk as it relates to relationships and and outcomes yeah I I I've been a longterm relationship no kids I guess I'd say frankly not as much I mean I'm trying to keep it's already a long book it's like 500 pages so I'm trying to keep the scope of it somewhat narrow I think I think some of it does apply that people um you know probably are settle a little bit too easily sometimes um I think the importance of what I call or not what I call the importance of optionality I think is really important in both business and interpersonal Affairs where are you walking down a hallway where there are a lot of doors open right um it's kind of a stupid analogy but you know I've lived in New York for 15 years now so my partner and I we have a you know pretty good group of friends and so let's say you don't have plans on a Thursday night um well there's a whatever one in three chance that someone will text you and say hey I just H made a res this new dinner place or you want to go to the Yankees game um just these kind of cool opportunistic things let's go to an art gallery that you that you don't have if you if you haven't facilitated different options in your life well you use the word optionality you're you're an analytics guy do you think it makes sense to get married we'll be right back probably for for tax purposes and stuff like that I mean there's still I mean probably my partner and I should should think about it at some point um yeah I I think there are still benefits uh from being married in terms of just the way the tax code it and things like that which I know is like a very very clinical answer you know I do think sometimes commitment is also can also be a good thing I mean I think there can be paradoxes of choice where you have too many options that's actually kind of one thing I worry about out there in the world a little bit is that like if you're somebody who's really good at taking advantage of optionality then the world's kind of your oyster now right now you can work from home and have five different jobs which I kind of do now and it's like but it's a lot to balance and if you're under duress right if you do have kids or an older relative that you're taking care of if you're injured somehow or or incapacitated somehow then it becomes a lot harder potentially so I I wonder if it leads to like a little bit more of a even though like Scott you might take advantage of it or or I might I wonder if it leads to a little bit more of like kind of a a winner take all world I think you see that on online dating it's great to be I mean there there's income inequality non crazy in online dating my understanding is the top 10% of most attractive males if you will get 80% of the opportunities oh yeah that wouldn't surprise me one bit and in some sense I mean look the capitalist internet driven economy is extremely effective at delivering whatever the efficient outcome is and mostly speaking I Am pro market but like we should think about situations where the efficient outcome the market efficient outcome is like not serving the greater good necessarily and that might eventually kind of Market correct itself somehow I'm not quite sure how I've been in the same relationship for a long time now um but yeah I I that's a great micro microcosm of it I agree so let's shift to politics um so Nate who's going to win the election how's that let's kick off there who do you think is g to win I can give you the honest Dodge which is our model as of when this morning we're taping this is about literally about 5050 Joe Biden had been a pretty heavy Underdog to Trump and his position in fact was worsening in our model he was at about 25% I think it might have actually been high given that he his fundraising had dried up that he wasn't really capable of running a full-fledged campaign um with Trump Harris it's a lot more even it's important for Democrats to remember that um Democrats have a disadvantage in the Electoral College so she is a favorite to win the popular vote she is ahead for right now in most polls of the popular vote um but theor College Pennsylvania Wisconsin Michigan Georgia Etc is liable to be very close um so yeah I I I wouldn't want to wager a lot of money on this currently but she has had momentum I mean it's been a pretty good roll out to her campaign and by the way I mean um this was an an example of smart risk-taking from Democrats right um is pushing Biden aside and they did push him aside I don't buy this rhetoric at like Biden benevolently decided to resign I mean Nancy II and Chuck Schumer were yeah it was kicked out they were pulling every liever they could and that's bold from a party that's often kind of triangulating and risk ofers and so and so credit to them for giving themselves a 50-50 coin flip instead of a personally I think very likely loss with Biden now they have now they have a real chance speaking of sort of triangulating and taking the less risky choice I was really hoping and thought it would have been a great move to choose Governor Shapiro as the VP and they've picked Governor Tim Waltz so by the way I think brings great sort of like Dad energy and my guess is they're banking that he has Regional appeal across the border states what are your thoughts on the VP pick and do you think it I mean at the end of the day we my my get is that we over tend to we we always tend to overestimate the impact it's going to have but what do you think of the waltz pick uh relative to kind of risk-taking and her moving her chances up or down no I'm 100% aligned with that uh take of your Scott I think Josh Shapiro is a star Talent and he's demonstrated empirically his popularity in the most important swing state Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania by the way it's a swing state for a reason which it has it has urban areas it has some diversity it has rural areas it has suburbs around Philly and Pittsburgh obviously um so he has like an actual demonstrated empirical track record and you know look I think Tim Wells is a pretty good pick in a vacum um but I did think it was a little bit risk averse if she was a 7030 favorite or an 8020 favorite that's when I thought it might have been the right choice when that's when it's like a Do no harm choice I do think because she's been moving up I mean I think she maybe overrate the importance of short-term momentum as opposed to in the long term it's really going to be nice to have someone who can lock up Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes um and someone who kind of really gets uh moderates excited because actually the Democratic base isn't as large as it once was and if you look at the voter registration numbers and it's more even than it used to be and a tie goes to Republicans in electoral college so I I it's I don't think it's a terrible choice I think I give like a B minus C+ but I think there was like a a slightly riskier but higher expected value option in Shapiro that that she declined so the Trump campaign calls you and then the Harris campaign calls you and asks for your advice on the two or three things that you would do in terms of messaging or tactics to improve their likelihood of a good outcomes first to Trump K Nate what are your thoughts on what we should be doing more or less of I'd say lay off the um anything involving race gender sexuality I think that's the Trump campaign at its worst and the temptation to do that with uh you know black indian-american women as the other nominee it must be tempting you know I think Trump has continued to Pivot to the center on abortion to some degree of course you know uh his party was happy about roie Wade being overturned but he's tried to down play that and I think in general moderation is smart and I think kind of you know focusing I think the two big liabilities for Democrats maybe three actually immigration is one I still think the economy is potentially a big liability for um for Harris and Democrats um it's good by some measures not as good by other measures we of course are facing a lot of volatility recently in the stock market who knows it'll be up and down on the day that people are listening to this um and focusing a little bit too on on tying Harris to Biden because Trump was beating Biden by four points or something like that in National polls by the time that Biden quit the race um that she's been the vice president that you don't get like a a race board once you've been the vice president for four years that you kind of own that track record maybe even owns the fact that like Biden's health and fitness are things that the White House has not been entirely straightforward about so those seem like it's pretty basic stuff but you know ta to the center avoid creepy race stuff and focus on the the problem she inherits from Joe Biden uh now do Harris go back in time and pick Shapiro but I guess it's too late for that now um look I think they have otherwise run a pretty good campaign they have kind of unapologetically triangulated to the center a little bit more they have tried out some new arguments this argument about calling Republicans weird for example I'm not sure it's fantastic and objectively speaking kind of most people who are into politics are pretty weird by democrat or republican but it's a new look and I I think she appreciates or her campaign team appreciates how much young voters in particular were tired of the same playbook for three elections in a row right in 2016 younger voters wanted Bernie but it was oh you have to hold your nose and vote for Hillary in 2020 they want to Bernie again oh it's a pandemic you have to hold your nose vote for Donald Trump right in 2024 no primary process at all and you know and Democrats were asking way too much of Voters I think to like to ignore the fact that Biden had clearly lost a step or two or three or four um and it just wasn't working at all and he was losing support among core demographic groups like young voters especially you know younger voters black voters Hispanic voters Asian-American voters of color so I I think she's been pretty smart so far apart from the VP pick I give her a you know a good grade for the first two or three weeks of the campaign so I agree I I thought I thought Shapiro was a Shuan I just looked at all of these boxes he checked and including you know being this incredibly popular Governor that would have delivered whatever it is the 19 delegates uh in a swing state have you done any my guesses they look they they're hoping that Waltz has that type of appeal across the region that he helps he helps their um case in in Wisconsin and Michigan have you seen any analysis around whether his popularity in Minnesota is cross border and is regional I tend to doubt it I mean remember like Wisconsin and Minnesota are big Rivals and football and hockey and things like that um and even the home state VP effects are are fairly small I mean look I want to read more reporting on why Shapiro wasn't chosen if they did a bad job of managing the internal process then it is like I think a little bit more worrisome for Harris because it certainly seemed like that was the direction she was leaning she scheduled a rally in penssylvania at one point on betting Market Shapiro was up to like an 80 or 90% favorite so I you know if they got cold feet then I want to I want to learn more about that because if you do get cold feet I mean there might have been like better ways of framing that decision I mean maybe maybe say that Shapiro has some alien family member he has to attend to or wants to focus on 2028 or something like that but it it was pretty strange to like tease at this kind of obvious seeming Bolder Choice and then and then kind of living him at the altar I I think maybe that is a little bit worrisome for how they for how they manag that but we don't know I mean there could have been like a vetting issue um they also moved up in the polls with the course of making the pick so they're a little bit ahead of trump instead a little bit behind that might have made them more risk averse and that's a bit more rational but but yeah it was you know it's somewhere between it's fine and maybe a more major mistake depending on the reasons behind it and you know given the timing of the show I haven't had reasons to read much reporting yet about exactly why she made this move we'll be right back so you've you're one of those guys who I imagine our listeners we have a lot of young people listen to the Pod who look at your career and think wow you shaped a really cool career for yourself give us a little bit of the origin story about how you got to where you are what do you think the most positive influences and decisions you made and maybe some of the mistakes you made because you you've carved out a really interesting seat for yourself I appreciate that Scott I mean I think look I think I also got lucky in a lot of different ways where I quit my consulting job in 2004 to play poker mostly internet poker um were you one of these guys in Costa Rica that was just online all dayline trying to take advantage of idiots like me that occasionally play online poker I was living in Chicago not Costa Rica I should probably have played more right I probably should have played like around the clock because it was a bubble more than a boom yeah um there were so many new players that like you were just printing money you probably had an expected value of I know 150 or 200 bucks an hour which is very hard to achieve when you're like in your in your 20s or something um so I probably should have played even more hours and grind it even more out um but what happened instead is that in 2006 the US Congress passed a law that basically banned Payment Processing to poker sites online so basically caused the games to get much worse now you have to have a you know a shady workaround to deposit your money and so some of the weaker players um left the game and so but that actually sparked my interest in politics um and it's 2008 I'm living in Chicago there's a youngish guy named Barack Obama who uh went to not went to taught at my university University of Chicago who's running for president meanwhile this is kind of five years after Moneyball and it's a time for the money Biz of everything so you know I had time for with my poker career having dried up I had time for something else and and started 538 and so there was a lot of luck and a lot of serendipity um but you know but look doing something you're passionate about and where your incentives are aligned I become like like literally like reacts as productive I think you know I mean like I I get a lot done over the course of a day or course of a week and like it's not like I'm you know I'm not necessarily working 247 I leave time for socializing and things like that but kind of owning your own work product and by the way I mean the biggest mistake I think I made was uh going and having 538 be attached to like a giant Corporation Called the Walt Disney Company for 10 years they were offering um a guaranteed paycheck but no actual business plan no actual incentive compensation or anything like that and I did work really hard for them for probably the first eight and a half out of those 10 years um but now that I'm back on my own and um have a newsletter subscription business and have my own podcast and uh do some Consulting on the side you know it turns out that actually I'm doing a lot better financially than they were paying me because the incentives are there and because like you know I kind of own my own image and work product and and it just way more it's way more my speed to be a little bit more entrepreneurial I'm not quite sure what I was expecting to get out of the big kind of corporate experience and just as we wrap up here given what you know about you know you write about politics you write about technology your advice to someone coming out of school or a younger person where do you think when you look at different Industries and you think that someone who's risk aggressive in this industry could do very well or sort of advice to your 25-year-old self what would those Industries or those jobs be I think being differentiated maybe that's a slightly too generic piece of advice but you know finding things that you're passionate about and things that you do like uniquely well right you know if you can be the best person ever writing about you know women's curling or something like that then it probably won't be a career for you but you at least positivly differentiate yourself one of the smartest things I did for the book by the way is just kind of talk to smart people a lot so you know having good conversations but I think we're in a world now where particularly with the rise of AI and I'm kind of a you know I'm not like a AI Doomer I'm also not an AI it's going to conquer everything person I'm kind of uncertain about it um but I think that will increase the premium on not being average because the AI will give you like a very good above average version of average if that makes sense right it can kind of synthesize all the text on the internet and put it together in a way it's a little bit dry and boring but you know plausibly pretty good and so do you kind of provide like a unique Vector I guess in the world that can't be replicated anywhere else I think that's a that's a valuable skill yeah I like what you said there I've always found that the specific crowds out the general and commit to owning something like you said women's curling commit to being you might think that's too Niche but if you're the best in the world at covering it then eventually you'll start covering ice skating or something or people will
