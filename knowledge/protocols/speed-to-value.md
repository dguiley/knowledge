# Speed to Value (Time to First Win)

> Customer retention is directly tied to how quickly they experience tangible value post-purchase.

## The Principle

```
Purchase → [TIME GAP] → First Value

Short gap = retention
Long gap = churn
```

> "The faster the customer wins, the longer they stay."

## Why It Matters

Delayed value realization:
- Creates buyer's remorse
- Allows competitors to steal attention
- Drains support resources
- Tanks retention metrics

## Implementation Tactics

### 1. Collapse the Gap
- Automated onboarding triggers
- First win within 24-48 hours
- Immediate visible progress

### 2. Speed to Lead
> "If you call them up in the first 30 seconds... the chance of closing it is just radically higher."

Response time directly correlates with conversion and retention.

### 3. Quick Win Architecture
Design your product/service so the FIRST thing they experience is valuable:
- Not setup
- Not configuration
- Value

### 4. Metrics to Track
- Time to first value (TTFV)
- Day 1 activation rate
- Week 1 retention
- Speed to lead (response time)

## The Automation Angle

AI enables:
- Instant personalized outreach
- 24/7 onboarding
- Automated quick wins
- Scale without delay
