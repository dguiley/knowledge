# Moving away from Agile McKinsey

This episode discusses the evolving landscape of software development as organizations transition from agile methodologies to integrate AI-driven processes and models.

## Core Thesis
The integration of AI in software development is comparable to past shifts in methodology, such as the adoption of agile practices. However, fully realizing the benefits of AI requires changes in organizational models and collaboration methods to overcome existing productivity bottlenecks.

## Key Insights
- **AI as a Paradigm Shift**: The introduction of AI tools in software development is creating a new paradigm, necessitating changes similar to those seen with the rise of agile methodologies.
- **Productivity Discrepancies**: There is a significant gap between the potential productivity gains with AI and what organizations actualize due to traditional bottlenecks.
- **Role of Specialized Teams**: Smaller, specialized teams with tailored roles improve performance and efficiency, moving away from outdated agile structures.
- **Importance of Real-Time Feedback**: Real-time customer feedback loops improve backlog management and speed up development cycles.
- **Adoption Challenges**: Effective AI usage is hindered by suboptimal adoption practices, calling for a reset in training and support to enhance usage and impact.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. **Re-evaluate Collaboration Practices** to align with AI-enhanced workflows and speed.
2. **Transition to Smaller Teams** for better agility and project management.
3. **Implement AI across Development Stages** to create end-to-end efficiency.
4. **Invest in Training and Upskilling** to improve AI tool adoption across teams.
5. **Establish a Robust Measurement System** focusing on outcomes rather than mere tool adoption.

## Notable Quotes
> "We’re at the precipice of another such paradigm shift."
> "These top performers are seven times more likely to have AI native workflows."
> "Building a robust measurement system that prioritizes outcomes and not just adoption is important."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
The transition from traditional agile models towards AI-integrated workflows can significantly enhance productivity and project outcomes. Wilde Agency can apply these insights to optimize team structures, refine task allocation, and foster a culture of continuous adaptation to technological advancements.
