# Build anything with Haiku 4.5

Published: 2025-10-17

10 years ago, you needed tens of thousands of dollars and a team of developers to build a software startup. Today, you can do it for less than $5. And that's thanks to this new AI model from Enthropic called Claude Haiku 4.5. And this model is not only better than GPT5, it's also multiple times cheaper. And this is how we can build a software startup for less than $5. And by the way, I predicted this exact thing a year ago. Take a listen. A year from now, we'll be able to build entire startups for less than $5. So yeah, if you want to be ahead of everyone else, make sure to subscribe. But let's look at this model because Enthropic really cooked here. It costs $1 for million input tokens and $5 for million output tokens, around 120 tokens per second, which is very fast. So open up your favorite editor of choice and just type in cloth. If you don't have cloud code installed, let me show you how. Open up Google and type in clo code. Click on the first link. This will take you to the enthropic page. And all you have to do is literally copy this command. Open up your global terminal. Boom. And paste it in. To launch cloud code, just type in cloud. Type in /model to change the model. And as you can see, we have three options. Sonet4.5, Opus 4.1, or HU. This is the new model. And this one is the fastest, which is what we're going to be using to build our startup for less than $5. And when I say less than $5, I really do mean that. If you watch this video all the way through, because most people have the attention span of a goldfish, you will know how to build your own software business. Even if you have super low budget and even if you aren't a programmer, so pay attention. Now, to see your limits inside of cloth code, just type in / usage. However, cloth code is not the most economical way to use this model. So, we're going to use one of the free open source extensions. I'm going to use kilo code here, which is going to give us exact overview of how much we're spending. Right? So, for example, I could say hi. And we can see exactly the token window and how much each API request cost us. So this one was $0.01. So like 1 cent. Anyways, let me clean this up a bit. Boom. As you can see, I have an empty project, no files. And if you're wondering, David, what are you going to build? Well, nowadays, everybody is trying to get Nats launch. We've seen, you know, OpenAI launch agent kit. We've seen uh 11 labs launching their own agent builder, Firecrol. Everybody is building a workflow builder. So, I'm going to show you how you can build your own workflow builder because this is actually much simpler than you think. People are scared of this, you know, drag and drop canvas and they think it's like something that needs years of development to create, but I'm actually going to show you otherwise. We're going to build it in this single video for less than $5. So, let's get started. So, when you're building a startup solo, you need as much help as you can get. So, we're going to be using this library, React Flow, which gives us the wiring for a drag and drop workflow builder. Right. Let's research the official docs. browse the web for the official React flow docs and tell me how to set it up in my codebase. Let's jump back into our code editor and we're going to use psycho here inside of kilob. So as you can see I'm running open router and the beauty of open router is you can literally choose all the models right. So, if next week Gemini 3 drops, you can easily switch to that, right? But right now, we're going to be using cloth haiku 4.5. Real quick, if you are still reviewing all pull requests manually without any AI help, you're honestly falling behind. And let's be honest, who likes reviewing pull requests anyway? This is where Graphite Agent comes in. It's a unified AI assistant that makes reviewing PRs easier, faster, and more collaborative. The moment you open a PR, graphite agent starts looking through it, sporting any logic errors, any unhandled edge cases, missing test or violations of codebased practices. But the best part is that it even suggest the fixes that you can apply with a single click. And inside of Graphite's PR page, you have a conversational chat panel where you can ask anything about the PRs, such as what changed in this PR, how can I test it in my local closed app, how should I implement my reviewer's feedback, or anything else. You can search related files, resolve CI issues, and even apply code edits all in one place. Look, if you run a software company like myself, or if you work at a software company and you have lots of PR reviews every single day, Graphite Agent will be a gamecher. Not only will it save you a ton of time reviewing PRs, but it will also catch bugs that you and even the most senior person on your team didn't spot because LLMs can spot issues that even 10x engineers can miss. And the best part is you can try it for free for 30 days. Get started today at graphite.dev. Oh, and thank you graphite for sponsoring this video. And I'm going to create a new task here. Boom. I'm going to switch to architect and I'll say, help me design a very simple codebase for a MVP project of an AI powered workflow builder using the React Flow library. So here we have a full report how to integrate it. Let's copy that. Let's jump back into cursor. I'm going to do boom report. Paste it in report. new folder named docs. This is good practice. And inside I'm going to create a new file named react flow dogs.mmd. Here I'm going to paste in the results of the research. And then here all I have to do is just tag in the file c react flow docs. The simpler the text tag the better. And the reason I'm using the architect mode is because we're architecting. It's for designing your codebase for planning out before jumping into development. Right? A lot of people when they get into AI coding, they get hasty. They want to start writing code too fast. But the secret is actually taking your time and planning, right? Kilo code is having trouble. Blah blah blah. Okay, whatever. Just like when building a startup, you have to do a quick pivot here. So, I'm going to switch to using cursor. I'm going to switch to Haiku here. We do need to track our costs. I mean, you know, cursor doesn't have the best reputation for this, but to their credit, they do have the dashboard. In the dashboard, we can track this and uh see how much we're spending, right? So, I'm going to say hi. And let's see if it's added to our cursor dashboard so we can accurately see if we spending above $5. There we go. Close for.5. Hi, coup less than 1 cent. Beautiful, right? So, let's copy the same prompt. Boom. And actually, this is kind of nice because cursor just released the plan mode, which is u what we're going to be using here. Look how fast this model is. This is like such a pleasure to use. I mean it literally I I was like amazed when I was testing it today, right? So for example, let me show you how good this model is at tool calling. List out my active tasks. So obviously vectal is a task management productivity agent and look at this. Boom. Just like that. This is not sped up. The model is that fast. It's kind of hard to believe that there are still people who manually manage their tasks using clickup to-d doist or whatever when you can use cloth haiku 4.5 inside of vectal to automate all of that and be way more productive. Anyways, let's jump back into cursor and let's see if we have the plan. We do. So, the beauty of this is that it always asks you how you want the app implemented. So, like I said earlier, this is actually the difference between beginner vibe coders and people who build serious software with AI. They do not rush into writing code and they actually spend proper time planning. So it's nice to see that cursor is building some of these best principles into their app. So in the plan mode again it asks you to clarify what workflow step nodes does your build need to support. Here are my answers. Number one, the simplest setup possible. So let's go with option C plus an H high coup 4.5 node that uses anthropic API to power the very simple AI agent. We want to make our workflows agentic. Next up AI integration level. What should AI do in this MVP? Just process the data coming from the node before it. Number three, backend requirements. Let's go with option B a simple NodeJS back end. Now before persistence should workflows be saved? Yes. Let's use SQL light for this. Again a very simple database choice. Say now get to work and design a very simple codebase architecture for this project using a proven and simple text stack. Okay. So thanks to the plan mode we clarified our thoughts. We refined the idea of what we're building and what we're not building. And this is what it looks like in the cur plan mode. It opens this markdown file and it gives you everything inside of a single file and then there's this button right here where you can save it. Boom. Save to workspace and it saves it into that curs/client. So you can actually reference this in the future. Yeah, I have to say great job to recursive team for executing this. So now all that remains is just clicking build and haiku 4.5 is going to get started on that. Let's see how our budget is looking because you might be thinking, "Okay, David, what if we are spending too much?" Well, let's see. So, boom. Let's look at these high cool costs. So, this one is less than 1 cent. Less than 1 cent. Oh, two cents. Okay, we have to be careful here. This one was 2 cents. This one was uh error less 1 cent, less than 1 cent, zero and zero. I think we're uh doing pretty fine. We're not even anywhere close u a single dollar. So, let's go back into cursor and let's see how fast this model can cook. It created 12 to-dos. Now it's going through the to-dos. And we can see on the right our codebase is taking some shape. We have SRC folder, back end. Let's zoom this out so we can see a bit more how this model is cooking. And yeah, it's progressing very fast. We go. There's some errors. We can fix those later on. Boom. Front end folder. Okay, we're going to be using Vite. Interesting. Now, while that's running, let me tell you a bit more about this model because this is one of the most important releases of this year and a lot of people are going to be overlooking it. So client which is another coding extension tweeted that this model is three times cheaper than set and two times faster than set and actually sometimes even more because um yeah sometimes it can hit like 130 tokens per second and it feels a lot faster and all of that while being equal performance to set 4. Now keep in mind just like 3 weeks ago everybody was using clot for set as their main coding model. So the fact that we now have something that's three times cheaper and more than two times faster is pretty amazing. Let's look at yet another benchmark. How cloiku 4.5 compares to set 4.5 and set 4 as well as GPD5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro. So obviously it's not as powerful as sonet 4.5 because in the anthropic family of models haiku is always the smallest one right but let's look at it right in terms of agentic coding it is better than sonet 4. incredible in terms of terminal bench aka actions it can take in the terminal while coding again significantly better than set 4 while being a bit behind sonet 4.5 looking at agentic tool use so we have three different types of actions retail which is like shopping on Amazon airline you know booking a airplane tickets and telecom like I guess updating your sim plan or something I don't know huge jump in telecom so I don't know this model can just uh save you money airline is basically unchanged and retail is a bit worse while Sonet 4.5 is obviously the leader in all of these. Now keep in mind that Sonet 4.5 is three times more expensive than Haiku while also being significantly slower. So let's look at how our codebase is doing. All right, so the plan has been executed. That was like what minute and a half. Pretty incredible. Let's see how expensive it was to architecture the whole code base. 1 cent 2 cents zero 2 cents 2 cents. Yeah, I think we're chilling, guys. All right, let's jump back into cursor here and let's see what's happening. So, 27 new files created. We have hundreds of lines of code, probably over a thousand. We have an error here, though. So, let's look at that. I'm going to tag the file fix the errors in workflows. DS. Boom. It can do that easily. Should probably initialize the Git repository. So, we're going to do that. Get init commit first commit. Boom. We don't have to connect it to GitHub now. No need for that. Also, we have a error here. No, we don't. Okay, there was a TypeScript type error. Boom. It's now fixed. Okay, let's see. How do we launch the app documentation? It even created readme file setup API. Okay, so let's open up setup.ts. That's nice. It gave us some docs. So, we do need to do npm install. So, let's do that. npm install. This installs dependencies. Then we need to Okay, we need to need to create an env file. I don't know if we have one or if we have a example one. Let's close this. No, we don't. Does it need to be in the back end directory? It does. So, right here inside of backend, I'm going to create a new file env. And here, as the setup says, we need two things. Our enthropic API key, which is going to be powering our workflow builder, and just the port. So let's get our enthropic API key. Now if you've never done it, just ask vectal, how do I get my enthropic API key? Give me step by step. Boom. And just I love haiku 4.5. Like this is literally becoming my favorite model. This speed is insane, guys. Consoleanthropic. Then we need to set up the email. If you don't have a cloud account, obviously you need to set it up. If you do have one, you can just loging in with the same account. But anyways, on the left, let's go into API keys. Top right, click on create key. Going to select my vector workspace and I'm going to name it yet another original workflow builder because we're building a super unique startup here. This is never thought of before. Now, do not share API keys with anybody except your YouTube channel. Just kidding. I'm going to delete my key before uploading obviously, but feel free to try it, guys. You never know. Maybe one time I forget and you'll get lucky. So, anyways, save the env file once you input your enthropic API key. And what else? Let's look at the setup. Okay, we have it. We need to run this command. We have some errors. I don't care. Let's run this command. Okay, we maybe we do care. So, I'm going to copy this. Paste it in. We are getting some errors. Explain what is going wrong. Do not make any fixes yet. This is another pro tip. Sometimes it's better to actually understand the error yourself before asking the AI to fix it. Right. So, let's see what's happening. Uh, command not found. Okay, we did run npm install. Okay, let's try again. npm install H. Now it works. That's strange. Okay, anyways. And then this will be the server. So, let's load that up. Local 3000. Nothing is happening yet cuz we're running into errors. So, I'm going to paste it in again. Say we still get errors. explain what these are saying in a simpler simpler and shorter way. Do not fix anything yet. SQL Lite is a native module. Okay, you know what I'm going to say? Let's just scrap SQLite al together and let's use JSON files as our DB. I know this is super unprofessional, but guys, we're building an MVP proof of concept, so calm down. Start by updating all the plan files and documentation so they know this and then simplify our app to use JSON files in the back end to store the workflows. We are getting errors here still let's keep this where's the error at the top express. So look at this. Haiku is going through all the dogs. We have all the MD files, updating it so that it clearly specifies that we're using JSON files instead of SQL light. Okay, so now it wants to delete this file because we don't need it. Let's approve that. Let's quickly check our API costs for 70,000 tokens. Oh, 9 cents. Oh my god, this is the most expensive we've gotten so far. Cash read, cash write. That's another reason u of benefiting. So wait, let me see. Cash. So yeah, look at this 10 times actually cash read is 0.1 and cash write is 1.25. So this is another benefit of if you have an optimized app that uses the enthropic cache. Well, you don't actually pay the full price every time because you only send new tokens for only for the new tokens you pay the full price. For the cash ones, you pay a lot less. All right, so the codebase has been refactored. We completely change our database and that was like what less than two minutes. Pretty impressive. So, I'm going to commit everything. Get commit changed db to just JSON files. Pretty crazy commits, I know. Uh, we still have some errors here. Express can find module. Okay, let's see. npm install. Let's Let's do npm install again. Boom. Clear. Make sure we're in the correct folder. We are. Let me ask you, do I have to be in front end before running nbm install? Maybe I'm trolling here. Okay, it should be run from root, which is what I was doing. Okay, so then I'm going to tell it to create a make file. Create a make file to make starting front end and backend servers even faster with just make front end and make backend commands. Boom. Okay, so npm install finished. That's beautiful. So maybe next we can actually run this for the first time. We can see our super unique workflow builder never before seen. This is a try harding way too much. But yeah, basically the make file is to simplify commands that you use often. Do make install. Boom. Make back end in a new terminal. We'll do make front end. And that's it. See if our app works. No, it doesn't. We're getting errors. Let's debug professionally. Right. Cannot get slash. We're not getting any errors here, though. So, let's do some screenshot debugging. Boom. Paste this in. Screenshot this. When I visit localhost 3000, I get these errors. Investigate why this is happening and implement a clean and minimal fix. Now I think we're seeing the rise of small models with haiku 4.5 because for a lot of use cases a very fast powerful model is actually preferable to a huge juggernaut that takes like 5 10 minutes to respond and there are a lot of examples chat bots real-time translation caption generation price drop alerts in a lot of situations you need a fast model and also it's kind of filling a gap in the market like last week as I was building vellan I was deciding what do I put inside of this organized feature which By the way, this is like oneclick way to organize all of your tasks. And right now, I have 300 active tasks, right? And let me show you how fast this can be done. And this is powered by Haiku 4.5 right now. Last week, I was kind of thinking like, what do I use? Do I use Gemini 2.5 Flash? But that feels like a small model, you know, feels like kind of low quality. Look at this. 10 seconds to analyze 300 tasks using 76 different agents. We're living in the future. Insane, right? And then obviously there is a reasoning for each tasks. Watch why this was selected for deletion. You can keep some of them you know by unselecting them. Boom. Delete. Yeah. This is the this is the magic of using the latest and greatest models inside of a fully integrated task management productivity app like Vector. So yeah, if you're still using to-d doist ClickUp guys, just go to vector.ai, sign up. You can get started completely for free. And in fact, I'm putting Haiku 4.5 as a free model. So all of you can use it. There's no excuses. And we have these built-in tools. A lot of people don't realize how much the chat agent has improved. Show me my tasks, right? Very simple prompt. And look how fast Haiku. Boom. Insane. Look how fast Haiku is able to like load up your task with this custom built-in UI where you can like see your tasks. You can click on any of them, you know, to open up the task details. Yeah. I mean, Vecta has progressed a lot. So, if you tried it like a few months ago, you need to try it again. It's a entirely different app. So, go to vector, give it a shot. now powered by Haiku 4.5. Anyways, let's go back to our app. Let's see if the error is fixed. Okay, looking at the serverts. Apparently, it is fixed. Let's reload this. Nothing is fixed. Okay, this is actually okay. I was on the wrong domain. All right, anyways, visit this. That's the back end. Why is back end meant on 30,000? Okay, whatever. So, that was my fault. But I'm here. This is our workflow builder. So, let's click on new workflow. I'm going to name it um not an A10 clone because that's what all these companies are doing. And there we go. We have our canvas. We going to do add an input node. Nice, nice, nice. Drag and drop. Works. Insane. Going to add a hiku node. There we go. AI processing. Let's see if we can connect. Connect. Beautiful. Next output node. Let's see if we can connect this. I think I'm ready to raise a seed round. Like if Mark Andre is watching this, I'm raising 10 million at $5 billion valuation. Okay. So, yeah. I mean we have this I guess let's see if our workflow works. So I'm going to say explain the secret of u machine learning. Execute error. Nice. We have error. I mean I I would be impressed if we didn't have any error. Look at this. Boom. We have this u mini map. We can zoom in. Guys, this is already kind of crazy. like the UI UI could be better, but man, we have our own NA10 clone. I mean, super original workflow builder, you know, like like all of these apps. You really have to follow me on Twitter for these um early hot takes. Anyways, so we need to fix this, right? Let's jump back into our cursor. Okay, wait. First, we need to monitor our cost. We cannot break the $5, guys. [Music] Anything more than 9 cents or 12 cents. Oh my god. 90,000 tokens. Okay, we need to do export here. We're going to export the CSV at the end and analyze all our costs to make sure I don't go broke here. It's kind of funny because I'm spending literally thousands of dollars a month on API cost running all the agents. So, but that's another thing. But now, maybe I can switch to Haiku and save thousands of dollars. We'll see. Okay, so where's the error? Obviously, it's not exposed anywhere. That's amazing. We need to add some debugging, some logs. Fail with status 500. Do we have it in the console? No. Execute. Okay. First of all, I kind of sidebar needs to be collapsible. Request fail with status 500. So, I'm going to blame it. We are getting front end errors, but no data, no feedback anywhere. Both our front end and backend terminals are empty. add a bunch of debug logs to help us identify this. Do not change anything else. Actually, maybe I should do a professional commit here because we have some changes. I'm going to do get add dot getit commit app finally works. Boom. So, it's adding some debug logs. Hopefully, we'll actually see these in our servers. Are these hot reloading or no? Yeah, I can see our context window is being u used up here. We have to be careful. Do our servers hot reload or not? Yes, both servers have hot reload. Okay, wait. Where is our workflow here? Reload. Let's load up. Did I lose my professional workflow? Anyways, add input. Maybe I didn't click save. Add haiku. Add output. Let's wire this up. Boom. We need to make sure this is all in order. Okay, all in good order. Let's save just like in anything. Um, who are you? Yeah, let's see. Super simple. We have error request failed. Let's see if we get some debugging console. Okay, nice error object. That's not really helpful, but it at least it's logging it. Back to closer. Paste it in. I'm going to paste in both terminals as well, so it has complete context. Here is the full context we have about this error. which is not much. So add more debug logs where it matters. So we can debug this ASAP. Do not change anything else. This original plan don't save API but the back end terminal is completely silent. No logs at all. This is just because it's not reaching the back end. Yeah, it's kind of a shame because you know we have spent a lot of time building this workflow. So we need more debug locks and actually in the meantime I have an idea. We can launch cloth code. Boom. Hi coup. So again /model switch ha coup shift tab to make it auto accept or say I need you to improve our front end design to be dark mode and more clean. Do not change any logic or functionality. Just make the UI more polished. Ultra think. Boom. Maximum power. So, I'm going to use a second agent to kind of start cooking on the UI because guys, we we don't want the investors to know that we're using React Flow, you know, we need to keep it secret so we can raise that um seed round. Let's see if we get the debug locks. Let's go back into our app. Let's run again. Execute. Backend is silent completely. Okay. Okay, whatever. I'm going to reload. New workflow. Second workflow. Boom. This one is going to be very different. Just kidding. It's going to be the same. Maybe the I don't know. Maybe the input isn't going into Who knows? Who are you? Execute. Classic error. Okay. Nothing in the back end. Wow. I'm going to create a new chat just to reset the context window. I'm going to paste in everything. Oh, our front end is transforming. It's amazing. Can't wait to see the new UI. In the meantime, maybe not the best doing everything at once, but hey, it's more exciting running two agents than once, you know. I'm going say we are getting errors, but our back end isn't logging anything. investigate whether the front end even connects to the back end successfully and give me stepbystep instructions how to debug this. Do not make any changes yet. Let's see what Clore is cooking here. Boom. Oh my god, a lot of changes. Okay, seems like that's done. Okay, not bad. Um, still the outline around nodes is white and looks ugly. Fix that. Also, the mini map needs to be fixed. Also, the mini map is white or light gray. Fix that as well. Make it dark mode. Our investors need to be impressed. Boom. Also since we're using cloth code and we'll say create a new file in root named cloth.md. Now update this file by adding the fact that we are about to raise seed round and that we need to impress the SF investors and that they cannot know that we are just using React below with enthropic API. They must think we have crazy big mode with custom models and insane proprietary technology. Literally, I just described like half of uh San Francisco startups. Okay, let's see. Still, okay, the mini map is fixed, but we still have these like white outlines around the input output nodes. So, I'm going to paste this in. Fix the UI of the input and output nodes. It still has that white around them. Okay, let's see. Whoa, we have some rejections. I can't help with that. Creating documentation designed to mislead investors. Okay, listen. This is not mislead. It's just business strategy. All right, whatever. I'm going to the file is created. So, I'm just copy my strat lod. Going to keep this. Paste this in. So now every single plot code will have this whatever. Make your answer simpler and shorter. Boom. Without reverting. All right, our UI is starting to look better. Why is the error message green? That's crazy. Make error messages red. Okay, let's see. Uh, execute. Watch the back in the middle. You should see. Okay, so if I click execute. Okay. Wait, wait. Something happened. Nice. Error is red now. Screenshot this React Flow. Okay. Boom. Is our back? No. The back end terminal is still empty, which makes me think that front end cannot contact it at all. Debug this and fix this. All right. Uh, our designer here is looking cooking. I mean, uh, make the left sidebar collapsible. This is, you know, taking up time. Like, we need some collapsible stuff. We're having trouble. Why trouble? Boom. Is the sidebar collapsible now? Boom. Insane, right? What? Where did our top go? Third workflow. We have to get rid of this toast. That's unprofessional. I don't think investors going to like that. Creating a new workflow still uses this lame toast. Create a proper model that is high investor value. Okay, we should do another push to GitHub because uh yeah, get I mean we're not using GitHub at all. Just Git get commit um UI redesign. That's the biggest change. No big deal. For things I have changed. Okay, what's happening here? Let me check the back is actually receiving responses. Backend logging isn't showing on me. Investigate. Found it. Kill that old process. What the heck is happening? Restart the back end. Done. There's old back end process running. I killed it and restart back end. Let me click execute. Wait, what's happening? So, we're using the cursor back end here. Wait, let me reload this. Professional model now. Very nice. Third workflow. Maybe first time is the charm. Boom. Input node. Very clean. Haiku node is the dragging your dragging is a bit broken now but can fix that later. Output node delivering crazy shareholder value not right now. Who are you? Execute error. Boom. Are we getting it? Okay, finally we have some traces. Finally something. It's kind of hard to debug when front end isn't connected to the back end. You know, that's what you get for speedr runninging a new app and having a $5 budget on building your own software company. Okay. Finally, we get some logs, read them and explain what is happening in a simpler and shorter way. Okay, this is the beauty of uh curs agent can run the terminal command and it can also see the output of it. Okay, so workplace zero node zero just pipeline has to find input node. There are none create a work. Wait, did I just maybe need to save? Well, okay. So, it's not finding my input node correctly. But I do have input node. Check our JSON database. Kind of a stretch to call it database to see if it is there. And if so, investigate why our back end cannot see it. Actually, we can see our third workflow here. It has input node. See, you can see the X coordinates. Our JSON database. Maybe I shouldn't be showing you guys my my DB data. Highly proprietary. Maybe that will decrease the size of my C round data is there work for free. Blah blah blah. Let me see. I found a problem. storage issue is when did you click execute? Okay, I'm going to execute again. Oh, Infropic API key variable set. We're progressing new errors. We're getting different errors. That's actually cause to celebrate. Okay, so now now our back end cannot find the envir despite me set what do I have it? I do have it. Despite me setting this in the env which is located in backend folder something is wrong. Maybe it expects it to be on the root. Not sure the env is in the correct folder. npm install.n social. No env exists anywhere in the project. Okay. I'm going to say dumbass. You just cannot see it because it's sensitive. I'm going to screenshot it. Maybe it'll prove cursor agent. Look at the screenshot. We do have env file in the backend folder. The problem is our code is not loading reading it correctly. You're right. Apologize. Backend process needs to be restarted. Okay. Is our terminal dead? Kill all local cross. Okay, wait. Let me reload this. Different front end. Did you also kill the front end? That's kind of unfortunate. What is at what port? Okay, same port. Nice. Back to our app. Third workflow. Let's run it. Hello there. Okay. Oh my god, it's run. It works. Okay. Wait, wait. We need to we need to make sure uh investors don't know what model we're using. So I'm going to update our front end so that nowhere it mentions plot 4.5 haiku instead. Okay, what is happening? We should call that node just AI agent higher perceived value you know and a lot of apps have this tendency of hiding what model they're using. We don't do that. Okay. So, I'm going to create get add get commit fixed enving issue. Boom. Boom. Okay. Let's see how refactor is going. AI agent. Nice. Nice. [Music] These should be replaced with icons. No big deal. Our designer can handle that. Replace these with icons instead. How is cloth doing? I would say good. I'm making cloth code better. All right. So, I mean our app works. It's u it's built. Let me export the CSV. I mean, we did some like cloth code redesigns, but that's not essential to the app, right? So, whatever. Let's see if how big this is. Okay. Read the CSV file in root. Tell me the structure. Do not do anything. Just answer. Okay. Now create a new Python script to analyze this CSV and output total spent on haiku for today date 1610 and tell me how to run that Python script. Do not do anything else. Okay, wait. It has total Python and again boom. Nice. So far we have $119. So we still have $3. How much? Uh 71 budget or 81. We have plenty of budget to working of our startup. Let's see any obvious improvements here. I think this is solid. You know we have collapsible chatb bar. We have uh Wait, did this replace? Oh, we have some errors. Uhoh. That's not good. Not good. Oh, we need to run npm install again. My bad. Let's kill everything. Um, boom. We have the Let's open up the make file. Make file. We have to these commands. Uh, make install. A useless command because you can just do npm install. Whatever. Make front end. Make back end. Let's see what what's happening. It's already running. What is the error? Explain what this error is saying in simpler and shorter. I mean, guys, let's be honest. You should probably learn error traces, how to read them. Uh, do not do anything else. But right now, we're on a budget and we need to develop the pitch deck as soon as possible. So, how come killing the terminal doesn't kill the port? Do that yourself and restart. back end. Okay, whatever. We're just going to delegate that to request agent managing our servers. It's 2025. Like, it's October. Like, why do we, you know, bother with the terminal, you know? Boom. Okay, so it goes. This is very risky, guys, by the way. I would not recommend that. Let's see. Do we have Okay, nice. We have these buttons, custom buttons for the nose. Sick. Yeah. So here is our uh not NA10 clone with custom UI proprietary AI agent powered by a mysterious model which is high 4.5. And all of that was built for a whopping how much? Did I lose my costs? Let's recalculate again. Who 19. Actually I over overd delivered guys. I told you it going to be less than $5. I mean this is less than $5 but you get the point. $119 is all you need to build a full stack app powered with enthropic API with react flow I mean proprietary technology. Yeah. So hopefully you see how much easier it has become to build a software company right all you need is the right idea. As long as you have the right idea and a bit of work ethic you can succeed massively in 2025 and 2026 especially in the years ahead. The people who will embrace AI agents and who don't make excuses are going to destroy everybody else. It's not going to be even close. I mean, the gap is going to be massive. So you better be on the right end of the spectrum.
