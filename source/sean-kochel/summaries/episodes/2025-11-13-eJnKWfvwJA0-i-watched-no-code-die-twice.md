# I Watched No-Code Die Twice

Sean Kochel discusses the evolving landscape of no-code tools and the necessity to shift towards AI orchestration and problem-focused development strategies.

## Core Thesis
As no-code and low-code tools become commoditized, their long-term value diminishes, particularly for technical innovators. By 2026, the critical skill set will revolve around "tool agnostic AI orchestration," which emphasizes problem-solving over tool dependency. The future demands abandoning traditional no-code approaches in favor of frameworks that prioritize problem identification and AI-driven solution orchestration.

## Key Insights
- The commoditization of no-code tools reduces their value for serious product innovation.
- Emphasis should be placed on tool agnostic skills, particularly the orchestration of AI to solve problems.
- A structured approach—like the "pro framework"—is essential for effective product development, focusing on planning, refining, and orchestrating solutions.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Shift away from no-code reliance and master AI orchestration for comprehensive problem-solving.
2. Use the "pro framework" to structure development: start by planning the project’s purpose, refine the plan based on user needs, and finally implement using AI.
3. Engage with community support systems to leverage collective knowledge and experience in problem-solving endeavors.

## Notable Quotes
> "Stop letting tools dictate what you can build and start letting problems dictate what you should build."

> "The real skill is learning how to use AI to rapidly understand the fundamentals and the principles that will make any product you choose to build great."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
- Understanding and integrating AI orchestration skills can enhance product development and innovation.
- Implementing structured frameworks like the "pro framework" can improve project planning and execution, aligning with client needs and industry capabilities.
