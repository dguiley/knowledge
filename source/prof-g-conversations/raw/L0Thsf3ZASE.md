what do people get right and wrong about the culture and in general the organization that is the CIA it's not like the movies at all you know it's funny when I when I revealed to my oldest daughter that I worked for the CIA her first question was a do you carry a gun and B have you ever lowered yourself into a hole on a rope you know like Tom Cruz in Mission [Music] Impossible Andy where does this podcast find you Arlington Virginia so let's bust right into it you've had a pretty robust career or interesting career from spending a decade as uh a US state department Foreign Service Officer of VAR US embassies in the Middle East to recently retiring from the CIA where you oversaw operations against foreign cyber threats and you've also been behind some of major US policy decisions can you walk us through your time in the public sector uh to where you are now just how how did you get how did you get here well an interesting uh Journey uh it started at age 18 believe it or not um when I applied for college I I decided to only apply to two schools much to my mother shrin uh the Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy I ended up attending the Air Force Academy did my four years there and then spent uh five years as an intelligence officer in the Air Force I fell in love with the overseas environment so took the foreign service exam joined the foreign Services you noted um and spent all of it uh learned Arabic spent all of it in the Arab world eventually you know uh migrating over to CIA and honestly I I thought before 9911 that I would be doing this sort of for about three four five years and then go back to you know where I was from the New York New Jersey area and do something different with my life but 911 happened that transformed obviously you know much of my generation uh but for me personally just changed the trajectory of my professional life and what I wanted to do and by the end of of September 11th 2001 I concluded what I wanted my life life's work to be uh to work in the National Security Arena and at least for a major portion of my career in the counterterrorism space what do people get right and wrong about the culture and in general the organization that is the CIA you know it's funny when I when I revealed to my my oldest daughter that I worked for the CIA her first question was a you carry a gun and B have you ever lowered yourself into a Hole uh on a rope you know like Tom Cruz and Mission Impossible and the answer on the first one is yes I've had to carry a gun uh in certain circumstances I don't own a gun uh it is issued or was when I was at CI was issued to me when I needed it and now I never lowered myself on a rope uh into a small hole um I mean I think the movies have to have a certain trajectory but if you ever had to pull a gun on an assignment CIA that was a very bad day and so at the end of the day it's some you know CIA is a lot of very smart people doing some very challenging work but frankly they're not any different than any other professional in any other discipline who takes their job seriously and wants to be part of an an elite institution it takes a different you know sort of person who wants to spend the bulk of their adult life overseas uh potentially in the third world or the fourth world or the fifth world if there is such a thing um and that's you know the major difference but again it it's not like the movies at all or Homeland although I I you know Believe It or Not CIA people do watch Homeland and enjoy it there are better rendition of what we do in CIA and I I could highlight a few of those for you at some point well give us one or two that you think when you saw what piece of work have you seen where you thought somebody there really understands us so Zero Dark 30 the movie that came after the bin Laden operation yeah you know the only fictitious part of it it it amalgamates a whole bunch of storylines uh into one you know two-hour movie script um but each one of the story lines you know for the most part was pretty accurate um um there's some politics associated with it but uh 13 hours the the movie that's associated with the attack on the Benghazi the conso and Benghazi and the the death of our Ambassador Chris stens um there's aspects of that that are not right but as far as like what Benghazi looks like what the compound looks like and what sort of transpired over that 13-hour period pretty accurate so before we bust into a discussion around cyber security what type of person when you meet a young person two people and you think this person would Thrive at the CIA this person would not do well what do those two people look like so in the director of operations where I I came from you know people a lot of people say you have to be an extrovert you have to be the kind of person who can rapidly learn foreign languages and and be comfortable comfortable in certain environments I I have not found that to be the case I found very introverted people to be you know quite good at at operations I think the most important attribute for a you know a futur future successful uh operations officer is to be self-aware and to be you know not brutally so but to be self-critical when one has to be and to understand what your skills and your limitations are uh professionally that's really what I've always as a as a leader in CIA that's what I've really looked for I haven't looked for any specific skill set like this guy's a great Mandarin speaker this guy's a great uh Arabic speaker it's really that self-awareness thing having you know a foundation of skills and intelligence but really being able to to operate in ambiguity in in difficult situations and know your limitations so give us a state of play around cyber warfare what what are the recent developments what are the key Technologies what do you see you know are the are the big forces shaping cyber warfare I'll go in reverse and and we'll get it because I I know you you and youve talked about artificial intelligence and what that means going forward especially in 2024 so I mean I think AIML is going to shape where we are in in cyber conflict so to speak uh in 2024 but um you know this is a massive debate in the technological Community but also in the policy and strategy Community here here in Washington DC like what is cyber warfare and how do we Define it that debate is not resolved I mean different countries use their cyber tools for different things the CH Chinese you use their cyber tools for intelligence collection primarily in in the realm of a intellectual property theft from health care companies all the way to the defense industrial base um and and essentially trying to lead frog uh over the United States technologically by utilizing our our research and development I like to say frequently that you know from a cyber perspective the Chinese are climate change the Russians are are tornado uh the Russians really like to use their tools just to disrupt the the current order uh as we know it what western United States LED they've also use their cyber tools for intelligence collection but also attempting to disrupt critical infrastructure but they as we've learned since the they invaded Ukraine those tools aren't what what we thought they would be uh and they there are quite a few limitations the Iranians they use their cyber tools uh in a very different and you know again this is in a position of advocacy it's a position of strategic analysis very effectively in the realm of coercive diplomacy they took down Albanian computer systems to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the albanians hosting the muad alh Hal an Iranian opposition group uh and demonstrated that you can use your cyber tools to achieve diplomatic ends and finally the the the North Koreans um they use their cyber tools to make up for the sanctions they don't have any money because they're sanctioned on on almost every front you could imagine so they use their cyber tools to steal cryptocurrency then attempt to convert it into fiat currency to fund their weapons programs uh and whatnot you know so that that's the state for the nation nation state actors I think one of the the biggest non- nation state problem we have is ransomware and criminal activity um and back to my point on AI AIML previously ransomware actors would would send poorly worded emails uh to to people and and ask you to click on a on a attachment uh and then that would infect your computer and they' either steal intellectual property or try to you know coers you know Ransom your data or what not but now with AIML tools chat GPT they can actually have chat GPT write those you know in and idiomatically correct English and use chat gbt or other AIML tools to build exploits even if they don't have any hacker skills so I think 2024 is going to be the year of criminal activity in cyberspace more so frankly than the nation state actors and that's kind of where I see 2024 going from a cyber threat perspective I just can't imagine how good it's going to be and even worse than the con is what happens when you can no longer trust anything I think that's what we're going to see in 2024 but the great thing is as technology advances in offensive capacity for criminal entities or nation states so does the defensive capacity and and I do think we're going to have you know plenty of companies and they're already coming above the water line uh attempting uh to come up with defensive software uh and or you know Security Services for small businesses large Enterprises uh to Def defend against this um I I also think what's important you know there's one thing if the private sector is focused on it the tools have have to be commercially viable obviously but the policy Community is actively engaging on this and and there was an executive order uh and a strategy put out on cyber security and and what we do with our US Government cyber tools back in the spring of 2023 and then late 2023 uh an an AI executive order went out which I think it's an extremely technical document for a document coming from the White House but what it demonstrates is a recognition of not only the promise of this sort of Technology but the threat it could pose you know not only to the security of your business or the security of other businesses but also just the entire way we we manage our Society up to and including disinformation and as it relates to democracy and all the elections around the world in 2024 so capacity and competence rank if you will the various nation states in terms of who does it the best or defends against it the best and how far ahead or behind are they the other key players in the context of a IML or just cyber security r large yes so so I mean I I I think the United States is is is Head and Shoulders above everyone else and in in in our Innovative capacity our ability uh to to capitalize on Academia and and all the work that they're doing despite you know the Press uh indicating otherwise I think where the PRC has an advantage is just the volume of humans that can throw against this problem set the the Cyber from just purely the government perspective in in China um I mean hundreds of thousands of folks are applied to their cyber their offensive cyber problems uh similarly they have you know hundred thous hundreds of thousands of folks working on the on the defensive side as well what also the advantage they have is is they control the internet the governments in in in you know China Russia or on North Korea uh it's it's not a a you know that they make reference to the great Chinese firewall it's sort of a a mirage in a lot of ways but they they they do control access uh to to Internet Protocol space in those countries we do not so that is a massive vulnerability but if I if I had to pick one of the two having the Innovative capacity of the United States of America versus having a vulnerable uh tech technology sector due to us living in an open Society I think I'd take the for this is an an elegant segue you have real domain expertise around the Middle East I would just love to get your sense of the state of play or what you see is happening in the Middle East and what the media is getting wrong and the role that cyber security or AI is playing uh in the conflict you know so October 7th I mean I think we'll look back historically you know a decade from now as being one of the most critical historical moments in the history of the Middle East and obviously specifically uh Israel um as far as the Middle East itself goes I mean I think up until October 6th the Arab world was in a trajectory slowly but surely of recognizing the state of Israel I mean the Saudis were on the cusp of doing that uh the amadis uh you know were were very close to to to basically normalizing you know fully relationships with with with Israel and I think in part that is why Hamas made the decision that they did when they did um because they were going to get left behind and arguably over the over the past decade they've already been left behind most of the Arab states have walked away from the Palestinian issue and Hamas didn't like that uh and put it you know on the on the the Forefront of everyone's mind I I think you know there are going to be governments in the Middle East principally the N Yahoo government who do not survive this um I think there's going to be a reset in politics I I I and I hope for the sake of Peace uh in the future that it's a government that that looks at not only defending Israeli territory but the rights uh of the Palestinian people destroy Hamas okay okay but the rights of the of the Palestinian people have to be addressed um otherwise you know it'll be again an Epoch of inata and non-stop conflict the idea that the the S Saudi Israeli reproach m is put on Ice in perpetuity I don't think that's true I think by the end of 2024 beginning to 2025 those discussions will reopen as long as Israel is not in all that war in Gaza still it seems as if the kingdom has been oddly quiet and it strikes me that that the two largest economies just have a lot of mutual interest in tying up together and uh what I have seen um I've been struck by how quiet uh some of uh the Arab nation states have been around this and that strikes me is that they're planning to hopefully let this cool down and then and then re-engage is that do you think that's a fair thesis I I do I don't have any concrete knowledge as I'm you know since I retired at the end of September I'm not really in those that dialogue anymore but my assessment is that that that will uh be be back on the table there's some certain hubs of of fantastic Tech technological innovation around the globe one of them is in Israel um some outstanding computer scientists uh cyber security folks and the Saudis recognize that and they want to partner uh with the Israelis uh because of that now Saudi Arabia is not perfect uh I mean they are the Muhammad bin Salan has has made a lot of progress uh has opened up the kingdom to to this to a great degree but um there are certain human rights issues that I do think you know are worth considering uh you know we can go back to a few years ago on Jamal kogi and what that all meant and and the murder of Jamal kogi so I mean it's it's not as if if the Kingdom's going to become a a a progressive you know jump foring democracy I mean it's just not going to happen is it going to be a productive economic partner uh for Israel for the United States uh for the rest of the Arab world absolutely um I think you know what what what has been forgotten in the press to a certain extent is the Saudis have initiated a reproach not not a full one but at least a dialogue with Iranian I think that may be one of the most important things to to to at least nip in the bud the potential for conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran and a a cross Persian Gulf conflict because that that you know would actually precipitate a a larger uh conflict that that just would be disruptive uh to the entire region if not the world it's interesting you say that because when I think of kind of rail politic would the US and or certain factions of the US government favor quite frankly somebody um turning Iran's Focus away from anti-western activ I mean didn't we lose a buffer and a natural enemy when we kind of took out of Iraq and that is we turned Iran into a superpower aren't there some factions of the intelligence apparatus and Congress would like to see uh tension between the kingdom and Iran I can say you know again this is as a private citizen but based on my experience I don't think anyone in the US intelligence Community would be wanting that sort of conflict to be perpetuated I mean the the US intelligence Community serves the policy maker and and the legisl branch in other ways um um if that is the policy of the United States which it isn't uh that may be the case um the invasion of Iraq in 2003 sort of flipped the boat on a whole lot of things um I mean I couldn't say this until the end of September uh of 2023 uh but the fact of the matter is I I wasn't a fan of the invasion of Iraq um it caused an enormous amount of chaos that is going to continue for for a generation at least and to your earlier Point yeah it the the the government of in Iraq under Saddam Hussein was a buffer for for the Iranians and the Iranians subsequently obviously moved into Baghdad and for for years really controlled the situation because you know we reduced our our our presence there um but but to your point of actually actively encouraging conflict between the S Saudis and the Iranians I think it's the opposite I think anything we can do to mitigate or prevent or delay a IIA peran uh conflict with with with the Sunni Arabs I think is in the interest of everyone we'll be right back so we're doing a bit of a world t tour here we talked about the chaos in the Middle East let's I would imagine one of the biggest losers from the conflict in the Middle East right now is zalinski and Ukraine because it just feels like we've taken our eye off the ball or people just don't seem to care as much how would you describe the state of play in the Russia Ukraine War and what do you see playing out given you no longer have access to confidential information but just as someone who's very good at observing this type of situation and just steing it down to a few points what are your thoughts on Russia Ukraine so so the risk of of it going off the the the front page uh and and it has since October 7th you're correct uh and I I honestly think the trajectory will continue as you know we have our 2024 election cycle I mean the the main risk of that is that there's not enough moment on the hill to continue to fund uh the president's programs uh and the aid programs the military support programs to Ukraine I really think that's the the only real issue there is certain Advantage uh for the ukrainians not being on the front page every day and that they can you know not quietly in Ukraine because everybody in Ukraine knows what's going on there U but they can continue uh their quiet offensive against the Russians and and you know attempt to succeed I I don't think you know there's a lot of press on the offensive the Ukrainian counter offensive uh stalling that is a real thing that that seemed to coincide with with the October 7th incidents I don't think that's a permanent condition I think ukrainians are Innovative uh theyve applied technology that hasn't really been used particularly in drone space I mean I think ultimately if we can continue to write the checks uh as US government to support the ukrainians they're ultimately going to Prevail I think they have to Prevail I think the whole structure of NATO the whole structure of how we secure Europe will be upended if they don't succeed uh and this idea that we're going to encourage the ukrainians to come to the negotiating table with the Russians is frankly an absurd proposition unless the ukrainians decide on their own to do so and I apologize for skipping around here but I'll put forward another thesis on another important relationship the West is struggling with inflation uh China is struggling with low growth we have IP Capital they have unbelievable manufacturing might aren't there just a ton of incentives for a thaw in us China relations I think there are and I I think in your 2024 predictions you you may have addressed that that the the biggest I think you I forget exactly how you said it but I think you said that the biggest tax cut we could have in the United States was a thwing of the relationships between uh China and the United States I agree but but there are you know very particular things things that the Chinese do you know again back to my point on intellectual property theft um you know prepositioning of cyber tools um what what Microsoft is called Vol tyone essentially the pre-positioning of tools and Telecommunications networks uh in Guam and elsewhere um I mean those are all very you know serious issues that we have to address but there is some Middle Ground where we we aren't necessarily allies with the PRC but we're not promoting an adversarial relationship and I and I I agree with you there there's too much at stake economically there's too much at stake from a just a a well-being of our our respective societies and and the Chinese Comm econom is in in Decline as you've noted and I think it's probably in their interest as well make the case for serving in the agency or more generally Public Service you're pitching a bunch of my students have gone to work for the government and specifically the agency make the pitch when you're recruiting talented young people to come to work for the agency or or our security apparatus so uh I had a wonderful retirement ceremony at the end of September uh Bill Burns the director uh was posted it and was the keynote speaker was an extraordinary event and then I was allowed to say my my my two cents and and what what I eved the agency for uh and and it by extension the state department and the Air Force you know the time I spent in the Air Force was giving me an extraordinary opportunity over the course of three plus decades to live multiple life lifetimes really a day in Baghdad uh was like worth two weeks back here in Washington I mean the things that I would experience the things that I would see um just you know only an infantes small group of Americans get to get to experience those are they dangerous Have I Lost friends of mine in situations like that yes but that doesn't negate from the impact that it had on my life so that was the key messages that I wanted people in the audience to have uh when I C was was just be thankful for being given the opportunity to to to experience such extraordinary things what I would say to people like who are in grad school now and it's a little different where where I teach because you know Folks at Hopkins at the school of advanced International Studies uh they all kind of want to go into the government but in in in other programs maybe even in an NBA program like yours at NYU I'd say yeah you can go to a uh be an investment banker right now after you graduate or you can make the decision to do some adventurous thing things around the the globe contribute to your government if for whatever reason your family situation wouldn't allow you to you know travel all over the world like I did there's plenty of ways to serve the United States government to serve the American people uh in capacities in Washington and elsewhere uh where you bring your your your talents to to really complicated problem sets and at the end of it uh you know no matter how long you serve for me you know over three decades but you know two three four five years you leave very satisfied that you had an impact on people you weren't getting paid enough but you can always make money so what I would say is you know don't don't burn your youth your 20s and your 30s making money you you can make money later uh do something that where you really you know exercise muscles that you wouldn't exercise otherwise and give give back to your country uh and and be in a position of federal service however you define that Andrew Bo is a distinguished expert in intelligence cyber operations and geopolitics he most recently served as the director of the CIA Center for cyber intelligence where he oversaw operations against foreign cyber threats upon retirement from the CIA Andy held the rank of senior intelligence service five the most senior ranked for career CIA Professionals in addition Andy has earned a number of recognitions including the intelligence medal of Merit and the presidential rank award he joins us from his home in Arlington Andy when I speak to you I not only feel better about America I feel safer uh thank you so much for your service thank you Scott for your time and I've really enjoyed our [Music] conversation
