the underlying theory of cognitive behavior therapy which is basically how you respond to it it's also essentially I I think what's interesting about these regrets is you know interviewing people about their regrets is that when people tell you what they regret the most they're telling you what they value the most they value goodness and they value love and I think that's very consistent that we have on human flourishing part of which tells us that ultimately at the end of our Lives what what's going to matter to us is do we have people in our Lives who loved us and did we love other people period full [Music] stop so let's bust right into it you wrote a book about regret the power of regret you said that the advice you uh give is to stay positive look ahead and never dwell on the past uh which is harmful why uh because we have completely misunderstood this emotion of regret um we've been told as you mentioned that we should be positive all the time never be negative we should look forward not back and that's bad advice it goes against the science uh it what the science tells us is that if we don't ignore our regrets and don't wallow in our regrets but confront them think about them look them in the eye it's a transformative emotion it helps us in a variety of ways well that makes sense I I don't my struggle is I I make mistakes every day and I can't forget myself and I don't know if that's regret but where does regret become unhealthy and a source of depression where you can never get out of the path past well I mean there's a big different so when it's a source of depression that's a medical issue what I'm writing about here is I'm not a doctor so I can't I can't opine on the medical dimensions of it essentially what we should be doing and I think there is some relation in how the the scientific ways to deal with regret are actually very similar to cognitive behavior therapy um which is essentially not looking at your emotions as who you are but as something that is going on as something that is going on in your life that is to examine them and so when you talk about Reckoning with a regret one of the first steps is something called self-compassion um and self-compassion is in some ways a triangulation between self-esteem and self- flagellation we tend to believe that lacerating self-criticism is the way to get us to perform better and there's no evidence of that um there's also very little evidence that kind of constantly patting yourself on the back and boosting your self-esteem is good what seems to be good is the work uh that Kristen nef has done at University of Texas on self compassion which is essentially treating yourself with kindness rather than contempt um recognizing that mistakes setbacks regrets are part of life and then using that as a stepstone to thinking about your regrets one of the things we see in the research on self-compassion is that people have a very many people particularly High achieving people have a very difficult they talk to themselves in ways they would never talk to anybody else so if I were probably to harness your self talk all right we were to use those those headphones you're wearing now and and create this magical thing that allows me to hear what you're saying to yourself uh especially in the face of a mistake it would probably be brutal it would probably be lacerating you would probably be cruel and chances are you wouldn't say that to somebody else and so what the research on self-compassion tells us is don't treat yourself better than anybody else but don't treat yourself worse than anybody else because it's not effective so all this just makes all sorts of sense right I've always said that and one of my things it's like three of my last five New Year's resolutions have been to to forgive myself self what is the actual cognitive behavior of the exercises to get better than this you logically it is impossible rationally logically not to agree with you what are the actual behavioral modification techniques for getting there I'll give you an example okay because this goes to some of the other ways that we deal with regret what seems to be a very effective technique on a whole range of things is what's known as self-distancing um there's a psychological phenomenon known as Solomon's Paradox which is that we human beings are pretty good at solving problems but we tend to stink at solving our own problems because we're too close to them so a way to be more compassionate to yourself is to is to say what you would say to someone who is telling you what you're telling yourself so if you have a friend who is telling themselves you're an idiot you're an impostor you don't deserve to be here you're worthless what would you say to that person I mean what what would you say what would you say to that person you you'd say for God's sake stop it and list off some positive metrics that's the kind of thing that you can say to yourself there are other great self-distancing techniques there's one of the best decision-making self- distancing techniques is when you're stuck on a decision is to ask yourself what would I tell my best friend to do that's a great very specific practical tip um in a business setting you can use the old Andy Grove technique where he said when he faced a tough decision back when he was the CEO of Intel he would ask himself if I were replaced tomorrow what would my successor do and he almost always knew and so the idea here in the research on self-distancing is that when we tackle our own problems our own issues we tend to look at them like scuba divers and what we should be doing is looking at them like oceanographers getting above them and there are ways to do that there's research showing that actually you can improve your performance if you want to talk about selft talk you can you can improve your performance by talking to yourself in the second person or the third person you know instead of asking yourself what should I do say what should you do or better what should Scott do in an effort to understand the difference between unproductive and productive regret have you been able to reverse engineer productive or unproductive regret any sort of identity or experience gender the way you were raised your approach to life not really I mean it's it I can answer that question in two different ways number one is that for this book what I did is I I I did two things I I did the largest public opinion survey ever conducted on American attitudes about regret trying to identify whether there were demographic differences and how people experienced regret or what they regretted so looking at everything from race from education level uh even things like introversion extroversion belief in God etc etc the one demographic difference that came out in this public opinion research was had to do with age and what it showed is that uh people in their 20s had about equal numbers of regrets of action and inaction that is in the architecture of regret you can regret something you did you can regret something you didn't do people in their 20s had roughly equal numbers of regrets of action and inaction but as people age the inaction regrets take over when you get to be your in 40s certainly 50s 60s 70s inaction regrets outnumber action Regrets by three and a half four to one so that's a big that's a big difference in in the in the content of what people regret but when you look at things like do men and women have different regrets there's some evidence there modest evidence showing some differences in my research I saw a tiny little bit not that much on Race a little bit on education level I found that that people with large amounts of for of formal education actually had more career regrets than people with less formal education which sort of is superficially surprising but perfectly understandable because if you have more education you have more opportunities which means you have more opportunities for gone um and so there the demographic differences in what people were regret were not massive now I also did a piece of qualitative research where we collected regrets from 26,000 people around the world and there I found that around the world people seem to have the same four core regrets uh that that go deeper than simply a regret about a career a regret about romance a regret about health a regret about Finance go deeper than those those surface domains of life are these the four you're talking about in your book Foundation boldness moral and connection can you say more about those sure sure the four regret so so again we have this pretty remarkable database of regrets from 134 countries um the the survey was up in in in Chinese it was up in Spanish and obviously was up in English and the the four regrets that people around the world seem to have are are exactly as you say Foundation regrets small decisions people make early in life that accumulate to terrible consequences later in life I spend too much and save too little and now I'm broke I didn't exercise or eat right and now I'm profoundly out of shape so that's a foundation of regret a boldness regret there's a very big category of regret you're at a juncture in your life and you have two choices you can play it safe or you can take the chance and overwhelmingly when people don't take the chance they regret it now that's not true for everybody there there plenty of people who take a chance and it goes south on them and they regret it but they are massively outnumbered by people who didn't take the chance and it and again what's interesting here is that it doesn't matter the domain so I have hundreds of people who regret not asking somebody out on a date hundreds of people who regret not traveling not starting a business not doing something that required a little bit more boldness than they were willing to offer up at the time third category moral regrets another time when you have a choice I can take the low road I can take the high road I can do the right thing I can do the wrong thing and overwhelmingly most people most of the time regret doing the wrong thing because most people are decent and most people want to be decent and most people feel crappy when they're not decent and then the final one are connection regrets which are about relationships and not only romantic relationships but the full spectrum of relationships in our lives so you've got a relationship that was intact or should have been intact say with a friend or with a sibling or with a parent or whoever and it comes apart and in many cases the way these relationships come apart is unexciting and undramatic they just kind of drift apart somebody wants to reach out they don't because they think it's going to be awkward and they think the other side's not going to care so it drifts apart even more and so those are the four regrets foundational regrets if only i' done the work boldness regrets if only had taken the chance moral regrets if only i' done the right thing and connection regrets if only ID reached out and it it's remarkable consistency all over the world in the way people talk about this regrets these regrets and the content of their regrets I love this type of research in addition to yours I read a lot of um what my colleague at NYU Adam alter has written about paliative care and end of life and it foots to everything you're saying the only the only thing we haven't talked about and it's sort of a mix of all of them or an Alchemy of all of them is that people the number one regret I've read is that people wish they'd been less hard on themselves they wish they'd forgiven themselves and that is one of my favorite sayings that's gotten me through a lot of hard times is nothing is ever as good or as bad as it seems and that when you look back on your life you won't be as upset about the thing that happened to you you'll be upset about how you responded to it your thoughts I think that's generally right I mean that's that is essentially the underlying philosophy of the underlying theory of cognitive behavior therapy which is basically how you respond to it it's also essentially uh an element of stoic philosophy which has become incredibly popular now um and so but I mean the other thing I mean I you know I think what's interesting about these regrets is you know interviewing people about their regrets is that when people tell you what they regret the most they're telling you what they value the most and so what we know from these four regrets is that people value stability they value growth and learning and not wasting their time on the planet they value goodness and they value love and I think that's very consistent with some of the other research we know on that we have on human flourishing part of which tells us that ultimately at the end of our Lives what what's going to matter to us is did we have people in our Lives who loved us and did we love other people period full stop I mean that's if you look at the research if you look at the the grant study at Harvard this lengthy multi decade longitudinal study of human flourishing that's what it that's what it shows and I think what's interesting about this research on regret and in general is is is also to your point Scott is most decisions we make in a given day don't really matter all that much and I think this is why it's important to think about our regrets you probably made a 100 decisions yesterday and it's today and you don't remember most of them but but there are decisions and indecisions that you made that we made human beings made each of us a year ago five years ago 10 years ago 20 years ago that not only do we remember them when we don't remember most decisions we made yesterday not only do remember a decision or indecision from 20 years ago but it bugs us that's a very strong signal that's telling us something and so we have a choice we can either plug our ears and say nope I'm going to be positive all the time or we can say oh my God I'm the worst person in the world and let it topple us or we can say huh that's interesting that's a pretty strong signal let me listen to this signal let me use it as data and when we do that there's a lot of evidence showing that regret can help us on a whole range of different things it can help us become better negotiators better problem solvers avoid cognitive biases strategize better find more meaning in life we'll be right back I think think of you as the motivation guy I I first came across your work I was excited that you agreed to come on the Pod because I remember literally 10 or 15 years ago I stumbled upon this video where you used an animation to kind of brilliantly and succinctly uh I'm sure you know the video it went everywhere and that was S I feel like that was sort of an inflection point for you um you were became kind of the you kind of owned motivation your book dried the surprising truth about what motivates us I loved the the way you broke it down autonomy Mastery and purpose can you say more about those three pillars of the of the motivation stool sure I mean what we know about especially motivation at work is that we we have this we sort of have this head fake going on we we think that a certain kind of reward what I call if then rewards are the secret to effective motivation if you do this then you get that if you do this then you get that and we have now 60 years of research showing us that if then rewards are pretty good for simple tasks with shorttime Horizons but not that effective for complex tasks with long Horizons and that for complex tasks with long Horizons what we want to do in the workplace especially is pay people well and then as you say offer them those three things autonomy Mastery and purpose so autonomy is do you have some control over what you do how you do it when you do it where you do it Mastery is are you getting better at something that matters are you making progress in something meaningful and purpose is do you know why you're doing it are you making a difference in the world are you making a contribution in your own little like terrain and those are the things that actually lead to enduring motivation these if then rewards are like it's like you I mean you can keep shoveling coal into the furnace but it burns up pretty quickly and but these these if these autonomy master and purpose which form sort of the trifecta of intrinsic motivation lead to enduring high performance what are the enemies of motivation I was default to the word now you want to write a book just start so many people come up to me I want to start a podcast I want to write a book I'm like okay start other than that I don't know what advice to give you what are the killers of motivation well I mean there are all kinds of killers of motivation I mean part of what it part of it is I mean what you're talking about in a way is is procrastination which is a problem of emotional regulation they sort of have this in Coit desire to to write a book but they don't want to deal with the discomfort of sitting down and writing the first sentence because that's really painful uh you know and so I I actually think that your advice to just start is is right I I think what you want to do is you want to try to change you want to offer people some scaffolding and some structuring on that so you know if you want to write a book and is set out in your calendar today 15 minutes to start writing and then do 15 minutes tomorrow and then do 15 in your calendar 15 minutes the next day and then expand that and over and over and over that's how you write books I mean I've written seven books you think I would if I were to have waited in until I was inspired to start writing I wouldn't have written a word I've written I was able to I'm able to write books because I care about what I'm writing but also because I show up in my office at 8:30 and write and do my job and then I do it the next day and the next day and the next day and I do it even on the days that I don't feel like doing it I do it on the days especially on the days I don't feel like doing it it's like it's like the famous Julie Irving uh quotation it's like being a professional is doing what you love to do even on the days you don't feel like doing it let's talk about that what is your process you it sounds one it sounds like you go into an office but what when you're writing a book that's kind of I think what you're known for what's your process you've written seven books how do you is there could you offer anyone some structure around how you get these things done I look at writing books like a blue collar job I think of it as being a brick layer and so what I do in terms of the actual execution of the book is I I'm talking to you from my garage office I I live 20 two steps in that direction I'm in Washington DC this is my garage office all right pinking World Headquarters is a converted onecar garage and at 8:30 in the morning when I'm writing a book I come into this office and I give myself a word count it varies depending on where I am in the process but I'll give myself a word count 600 words 700 words I don't bring my phone with me in the office I don't open up my email I don't watch ESPN highlights I don't do anything until I hit that number and then when I hit that number I'm liberated to do other stuff but nothing until I hit that number some days I hit that number at 10:30 11 other days I don't hit it till late in the afternoon and those are crappy days but I don't do anything until I hit that number and then I do it the next day and then I do it the next day so if you want to have process it's not anything exalted it's not like I sit in the corner over here with a smoking jacket on listening to go for God to dictate sentences to me no I show up in my Works Space and I do my work uh you're dad my understanding has two daughters and a son what is what is your work on motivation regret how does that change your approach to Parenting you know I I think I'm a pretty autonomy supportive parent to use that that kind of technical language um so I I try to support my kids autonomy so not be directive too directive about what they have to do now the underlying fact here is is that I mean we have 50 years of evidence that the effect of parenting on kids especially their intellect and their personality is very small so you know the unhappy fact of genetic research for many parents is is that identical twins raised apart are more similar in intelligence and in personality than fraternal twins raised together so you know arguably the most important things that a parent gives a kid in my view especially in America are genes and a zip code if you look at the work of Raj Jetty the most important thing parent gives a kid are jeans and a zip code now again when we're talking only about their outcome I mean you know I I I I I I gave my kids jeans and I gave my kids a zip code but more important than anything else I love them more than anything in the world and whether that has an effect on their outcome I don't know but you know it's what it's what it's what parents do but I don't I think a lot of parents are mistaken about how much control how much effect they have over who they kids become and what about being a good partner what about being a good husband when it comes to regret I think it's really important to talk to your partner even your kids about your own regrets that is a lot of times people sit with their regrets they they think that somehow they're the only one who doesn't have who has who has those regrets and there we have ample evidence showing that writing about your regret or talking about your regret it can be quite effective because it's an unburdening it's a sensemaking and the other mistake that we make this is true not only only with our kids and with our partners but out there in the world is that we mistakenly believe that when we talk about our mistakes or our screw-ups or our setbacks that people will think less of us when in fact we have some good evidence that people think more of us uh that they admire our cander they admire our courage so I think one thing you can do with partners and with kids is talk about your regret but not in a self flatulating way talk you know say here's something I regret here's what I learned from it here's what I'm going to do about it and that's a good way to normalize it and it's a good way to treat regret as as facts as as information as signal as data that's really the key we have a lot of young people to listen to the Pod and I look at you you know I look at your life and it strikes me doing something really cool really interesting you make a good living can you provide any advice around in terms of your lived experience when you were a younger man what did you do well what did you not do well if for someone out there who thinks I want to be a great Storyteller and make a really good living at it I want to I want to be Daniel pank like what advice would you give to someone maybe avoiding some of the mistakes or maybe getting there although you've gotten there pretty quickly what advice would you have for someone who says I want to I want to be the next Daniel pank I would say get a better goal than that for starters because that is that is a that is that is a terrible goal being another Scott Gallery being another ex that's a terrible awful goal that's the first and I would say that with with a degree of harshness I would say you don't want to be the next blank you want to be the first you beyond that you know I mean among the things that I've some of the things that I did right and some of the things that I did wrong um among the things that I did right were that at a certain point Y Young in my life relatively young in my life I I kind of stopped caring about what people thought about me um and I felt that earlier in my life I was fairly concerned about what people thought about did they think I was cool did they think I was smart did they think was accomplished and so forth and then I came to this startling Revelation about what people thought about me and that was they weren't thinking about me nobody was thinking about me because everybody's thinking about themselves and so that was like a great liberating moment so don't think too much don't think don't care about what other people think that's that's the most important thing I I'm you know the rest of it I think is pretty standard it's like I'm a you know if you outwork people and you take more shots on goal than people than most people you're going to be all right I mean if you if you don't care what people think you outwork them other people and you take more shots on goal you're going to be all right I mean I know can't tell you how exactly it's going to happen but it's going to be all right the the other thing that I would tell people is forget about planning in in any kind of detailed way um one of the things that I suggest that young people do is that they find a Scott Galloway they find someone who's doing something cool you know someone in their 50s or whatever who's doing something cool who's doing something interesting oh my God that'd be so great to have a pie oh it be so great to do that and I say talk to that person and ask them how they got there and I say I guarantee you that 49 out of 50 interesting accomplished people answer the question like this it's a long story because it was failure it was circuitous it was unplanned there was Serendipity there was good luck there was bad luck and so you know if you again outwork take more shots on goal don't care what people think be generous do great work you're going to be fine truly I mean you really are I mean it's easy easy you know it's easy to say from the vantage point of someone who was 60 years old but it's true um the one thing that I didn't do well Scott I think I relied too heavily on myself throughout my life especially professionally and I never like someone says who's your Mentor I said I don't have a freaking Mentor um I never had I never had a great I never had like a mentor I not because like people weren't kind and generous to me it's because I was sort of too arrogant to think that I needed something like that and so so one of the things that I could have done a better job on is finding mentors seeking advice from a wide range of people doing a better job of working through other people uh rather than simply do everything on my own that's one thing that I could get better at in the next chapter of My Life we'll be right back you're part of a year-long project with the Washington Post opinion section called why not I want to talk about some of the things that your readers uh or some of the ideas that your readers responded especially strongly too the idea of paying teachers $100,000 a year um you said that left turns and the busiest intersections should be banned and in another column you posed the question or you suggested that on your birthday you should give other people presents so pick any or all of them and say more so the column as you mentioned is called why not we take ideas that seem to be out of the realm of possibility and say well why not so let's Pay Teachers a minimum salary of $100,000 a year we're losing too many good teachers teachers are not respected enough so let's put our money where our mouth is and actually pay teachers a minimum salary of $100,000 a year I got an amazing amount of love and amazing amount of hate from that from that column which is a good sign um people saying this is the greatest idea ever other people saying what are you talking about no teacher is worth that amount of money so that's one um the best idea in my view is Banning turns in the busiest intersections in the busiest cities and this seems nutty but there is there's a guy at Penn State and engineer Penn State he's done huge numbers of papers on this and essentially in the busiest intersection first of all in the busiest intersections the busiest cities we have incredible numbers of of collisions and actually a shocking number of deaths and injuries um in those particular places uh we also have uh they also it also contributes massively to pollution and uh and climate change and so if we just ban left turns even if it requires some people to make three right turns what the evidence shows is that everybody gets to where they're going faster because instead of accumulating these SL you're stuck behind some I live in Washington right I'm driving up Wisconsin Avenue and there's some Schmo in front of me who's turning left and I'm stuck waiting behind him as he turns left onto Alam Marl or wherever all right and so but if you eliminate that all the way through people will get where they're going faster the math on this is in exorable and also we know that UPS in its tracking software generally requires its drivers to make three rides rather than one left because it saves massively on time and on fuel um and then there's giving presents on your birthday rather than receiving presents on your birthday I think it's a nice I think it's a nice tradition I did it on my 60th birthday basically as a way to bomb my existential crisis ATT turning 60 um and so what I did is I found you know 90s something people in my life who I was grateful for and I created these custom pencils because I love pencils as you can see see I'm holding a pencil right here and and I gave people these set of three pink pencils with a note telling them that I valued them in my life and I was glad to have them in my life it was a it was a cool meaningful thing to do and I sort of skated past the existential dread of that day I like that um I just drank a lot so they're not mutually exclusive there you go here's p as a drink stir you've been in the media game mostly through books for a while I'm curious how do you see how is the changing or the shifting media landscape you're technically a Creator I don't know your presence on social media how is the media landscape has the me changing media landscape been good or bad for Daniel pink and how are you adapting what you do based on changes in the media landscape you know what it's a great question Scott and um whether it's been good or bad for me I don't know I mean it's harder to contend with because what you have is you have this kind of perfect storm here where the barriers to forgive the cliche but what you have is the barriers to entry are essentially zero to create stuff and then the shelves on which the stuff sits are infinite okay and then you have something a device that allows you access to all that stuff and you carry it on your person all waking hours right that's a big freaking deal and that's very different from when I was was when I started out 255 years ago and so for me um you know I'm trying to I I spend very little time on social media um I spent very I just don't like it uh I don't find it interesting um but I think that things like podcasts are extraordinary when I when I promoted my first book I did a radio satellite tour when I promoted my last book I did 138 podcast interviews all right that's a different that's a different media landscape um uh I think that video and TV is actually really really interesting right now so you know if I were to I did a television show on a cable on a cable network you know eight or nine years ago um I don't think I'd do that again if I were to if I were to create a new television show I would go straight to Youtube and I think that that is I think that's S I think that's super I think that's super interesting and so um so you know is it good for me is it bad for me I don't know but it is for me and so you have to deal but it's been a big change I have to say and and I also think that books have changed Scott um you know I think that that that books are not I'm a writer so my muscle memory my instinct when I have an idea is to write a book and I am actually trying to check that impulse because it might that might not be the best vessel the best expression of that set of ideas that set of arguments that set of stories it might be something in another medium so that's how that's some of the ways that I'm trying to adapt to this this New Media landscape yeah Daniel pink is the author of various bestselling books on a range of topics including human motivation the science of timing and creativity his books include the New York Times bestsellers the power of regret a whole new mind and when as well as a number one New York Times bestseller drive and to sell is human he currently has a column with the Washington Post called why not he joins us from you're in DC is that right Daniel yes sir e
