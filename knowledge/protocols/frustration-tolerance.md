# Building Frustration Tolerance

> Your ability to do things you don't want to do, without immediate reward, for extended periods—is a learnable skill.

## What It Is

Frustration tolerance = doing uncomfortable things consistently when there's no immediate payoff.

This is the actual definition of discipline. Being consistent with things you enjoy isn't discipline.

## Why It Matters

Most entrepreneurs fail not because they don't know what to do, but because they can't sustain uncomfortable activities long enough to see results.

## How To Build It

### 1. Start Small, Build Up
Progressive exposure:
- Week 1: 10 outreaches/day
- Week 2: 20 outreaches/day
- Week 3: 50 outreaches/day

The muscle grows through use.

### 2. Use the Rule of 100
Commit to 100 reps before evaluating. This removes the "is it working?" escape hatch.

### 3. Remove Decision Fatigue
Don't decide IF you'll do it. Decide WHEN.
- "I do outreach from 9-11am every day"
- No negotiation with yourself

### 4. Track the Streak
Consecutive days builds identity:
- Day 1: "I'm trying this"
- Day 30: "I'm someone who does this"
- Day 100: "This is who I am"

## Common Traps

| Trap | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "I'll start when I feel ready" | You'll never feel ready |
| "I need to optimize the approach first" | Do reps, then optimize |
| "It's not working" | You haven't done enough reps |
| "I'm not motivated" | Motivation follows action, not the reverse |
