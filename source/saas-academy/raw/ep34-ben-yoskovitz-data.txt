the core philosophy in the book is use data to drive your decisions and I think if you asked most Founders are you data driven they'd all say yes but we found in working with thousands of early stage SAS companies sometimes perception and reality are too very different things in your business there is one metric you can use the mistake I think a lot of folks make is collecting almost too much data and so I think people say oh I'm data driven because I'm collecting a ton of stuff but they're actually not sure what to do with the data Maybe I'm making decisions off the data but I'm still not prioritizing the stuff that actually matters and that's where people drop the ball well been in preparation for our conversation I went to go to my bookshelf and pulled something out that I acquired many years ago and something I didn't notice was I looked at the back and I realized that we've got a a common friend the second I don't know what you call it like quote or promo on the back of the book is Dan Martel so I'm curious how how did you meet Dan oh geez uh well Dan's Canadian uh and I'm Canadian and so as you know all Canadians know each other um so so that I think that's how it happened honestly I don't remember when I first met uh Dan but but it's from the tech it is from the tech ecosystem uh and um and so I've known him a long time he was probably doing Clarity at the time like a a star start up that he was running back in the day I I think that's what he was doing at the time out east um so yeah Tech ecosystem it's it's it's a pretty it is a pretty small community in Canada yeah you just gave us all the ammo we need to to continue to I uh you give Dan some for being Canadian for the next couple of years because it does seem like you had me at oh you guys are both Canadian yeah well it makes sense that you're yeah yeah yeah it's mystery solved well cool I'd love to you know there's a handful of things I want to unpack in our conversation today you've had a real you've you have been at the epicenter of what of the evolution of tech over the last 15 you know 20 years and I Matt and I both got our start in Tech I would call it maybe I don't know which wave it was we started in about 2013 2015 exited our companies in 2019 but I've always I've read books about and and heard the stories of early day Silicone Valley and uh you that was where you got your start so I love this pick up the story in uh through lean analytics and um the I I think a lot of Founders the core philosophy in the book is use uh data to drive your decisions in the especially in the early stage of a startup when you're still trying to figure out what is the product who are we serving what's the model and I think if you asked most founders are you data driven they'd all say yes but we found and working with thousands of early stage SAS companies sometimes perception and reality are two very different things you peel back the layer and you realize if they're not so can you walk us through a story two of what it looks like to have lived out the lean analytics methodology what does it look like describe how a Founder actually interacts with data in a way that helps them um so maybe we help close some of the gaps of the for the gap for some of the founders that think they're being data driven right now and maybe maybe aren't yeah yeah it's it's a it's a great question because I think um the mistake I think a lot of folks make is um is collecting almost too much data so like especially now the like book is 2013 you know now it's 10 years later it's just it's even easier to collect more stuff and it's easier to read more stuff about data right because there's just more content out there benchmarks and this and you should this is what you should focus on so I think it's got even more overwhelming than it was and so I think people say oh I'm data driven because I'm collecting a ton of stuff but they're actually not sure what to do with the data or how to make decisions off the data and and that's really the principle of the book which was collect everything that's fine like you never know when some a piece of data or whatever might be useful but try to be laser focus on what actually matters now and and you know using first principles solve the most important problem now not something that just doesn't matter so I think it it's uh the the problems today are even worse than they were when we wrote the book is is one way of uh of thinking about it uh and and again like we when we and I say we because Alistair croll and I like co-authors of the book when we wrote the book we were um also doing a a very early stage accelerator called year one labs and uh it was right around Lean Startup we're like we're going to apply Lean Startup methodology and we we uh built and funded five companies um they all happened to be consumer companies that wasn't the intent it's just it's just sort of how it materialized but um we we we we took them through this model of okay first go validate what the problem is then go build an MVP then measure if people are using the MVP is it sticky and we were writing the book If you will as we were applying lean up and trying to make it more practical and so again to me I think what happens now is collect data Maybe I'm making decisions off the data but I'm still not prioritizing the stuff that actually matters and that's where people drop the ball I'm not uh that makes a ton of sense I think Matt over here within Arms Reach has got a hat that says I love data and if he had it his way he'd have a thousand rows of of of metrics and data even at the earliest stage of of a startup so I kind of want to i' love to pick up these two ideas Ben where where is too much data harmful like do you have a scenario where you started working with a a Founder early on and they were tracking too much and you had to go through because you work hands- on I love what you do Highline beta you you think of yourselves as co-founders to uh the companies you're working with rather than investors although you do both have you had to go through a series of pairing back data for a Founder to get focused on the most important thing yeah I think I think um yes uh we we've had cases where folks are again collecting a lot but uh not sure how to validate where the problem is so to me this is usually like use an example of um like a like a simple funnel right so we say okay I have an onboarding funnel um to to get to activation and people are coming through the top and I'm measuring traffic and I'm measuring conversion through the onboarding steps uh and I can see um you know people are dropping off at step four in the process uh and because the you know the data tells me like you know I start with a 100 people and it drops all the way down and and so a couple of things happen one is is my funnel good enough you know so like out of a 100 X come out the other end is that good is that bad I don't know and that that's hard to know because there's a lot of variables but also like oh step step four step four there's a lot of drop off in step four so then they go in laser focused on trying to fix step four in that onboarding flow except they don't actually know what's broken with it and so then they go into AB testing it um you know oh take the button move it from the left to the right do whatever whatever it is and now I've got all these iterations of this thing and at an early stage probably not even enough people coming through the top of the funnel to get any material measurement of it so like every change I think almost always improves things a little bit but not enough to know if I fixed it and so it's that's a good example you know we see when a company first launches a product or even before they launch pre-launch right and like just getting people to the site and seeing if they'll sign up but something's broken in that process and now I'm I'm just fussing around with it you know and and then I'm just obsessing over that thing as opposed to maybe focusing on something else that might matter which is look I think you got enough people through is anybody even using the thing and getting value right so it's just to me it's about prioritizing what actually matters I'll give you like another example although not as data well I mean in a way data oriented so I mentioned year one Labs one of the companies we were working on you know they launched their their app uh and they um uh South by Southwest I don't know if you guys remember the name Robert scoble Robert scoble still around but anyway he he was doing a lot of Media stuff and he um I think he tweeted best app at South Southwest and it blew up right the app blew up so now you're tracking all the users and I remember it like exploded in Japan at one point it was like right but then of course that was like a blip and then you know usage drops new signups drop and I remember the founder coming to me and saying if we could just get more PR it would solve all our problems you know and so you're watching the data because you get this huge Spike and then it it it dips and I was like but the people who got in don't stick around for more than a couple of weeks anyway whatever the number was I don't remember right but it's like that your problem isn't more people through the top your problem is is over here so these are just examples of people focusing on the wrong thing I think sometimes looking for a quick fix you know uh and hoping that the data will just then look better and they can move on with their lives but it's it's of course more complicated than that yeah I I actually it's funny Johnny was trying to TS up like there's going to be dissenting viewpoints I actually think we're pretty we're pretty aligned because you know um it's like what's the old saying right it's like when when you've got a problem to solve and something you can measure you can either solve the problem or solve the data you know you either fix the real problem or or change the way you're measuring it or you know Goose the one number that everyone's leaning on you about in order to make the number go up and make yourself feel better I think your PR example is is really really good um you know in the book one of the concepts that comes up is the the one metric that matters or some people call the Northstar metric and I'd love to get your your point of view on it first so I've got some specific questions but can you just walk through it um you know 30 seconds or so for people who aren't familiar with what the concept is yeah so so the the principle for us was at any given point in time in your business depending on what stage you're actually at there is one metric you can use uh to focus on and so and then all of your experimentation and your work can be against uh you know improving that number to a point where you feel like it's good enough or the experiments you're running are giving you diminishing returns on that and you need to move to the next thing and so it was never meant to be one number fixed forever um but really like and it could change at the early stages in particular that number could change quite frequently right because the the the frequency of experimentation is really high the frequency of change is really high as a company matures I think the one metric that matters um starts to harden you know it's like okay that doesn't change like we're into Revenue now and we're scaling the one metric that matters Pro something that really is becomes like a health metric for the business but early on it's like look you can't fix everything at once you got to solve one problem and then again the the the key is is like solve one thing just leads to another problem so then you you know shift the one metric that matters then focus on the next thing then focus on the next thing and keep going yeah I thought your maturity model around that was interesting right was it from empathy to revenue and then scale on the on the mature side I think at least for me with you know I see Founders they try to pick this concept up and use it and I'm interested in your Viewpoint here I feel like one of the places people go wrong with this is they think it's the only metric they need to measure just cuz it's the one thing that matters have you seen that too yeah yeah I've yes I have um and then the other I think and look these things are not easy right so it's like it's easy to be like oh just track this track that it's it's not as simple as that but so yes I think people get um Founders but people are always looking for the simplest framework the simplest solution that the like please for the love of God just give me the answer to the problem that I have right so the one metric that matters sounds really cool CU like oh you all I have to do is focus on one thing that's so amazing obviously real life is not like that um and so you know what we try to help people understand is there is like a health indicator for the business that tells you things are going well or not well um but there are going to be underlying numbers that you have to track at the experiment level at the pro at the feature level you know these are things that ideally as one number moves moves let's say improves it bubbles up and also has an impact on the one metric that matters because the other problem you see is if people pick too small a number uh you know like I'm building a feature and I want to track its usage well that like that makes perfect sense I I would do the same thing uh usage of the feature is you know launch the feature usage is good awesome that that feels great what I don't know is did anybody buy more did it help retain people more uh did it increase ACV like I don't know what it actually did to improve the business just because this one feature is being used so you know picking the Fidelity for that one metric that matters and then figuring out how you know a feature or a small thing I'm doing or an experiment I'm running impacts the business yeah that's where the hard work and and some of the Strategic thinking has to go in yeah I agree I think the other vulnerability that I've seen is it's like the the lower the the Fidelity or like the higher level the one metric is I feel like the longer the reflex time is right because it's generally like a aggregate or calculated result of a number of other metrics and so it's it can be difficult to manage it's great to your point of like a a pulse check on what's the health of the company especially if it's you know Revenue which is relatively far Downstream but it's it's one of those things you can't directly manage right it's at the the very end of a a causal chain of a lot of other stuff yeah it could be it absolutely could be I think as the company matures it definitely it it turns into that I think at the like you mentioned sort of the stages that we like the maturity model you know from empathy and then and then we went to stickiness which is really which is really usage to me um the one metric that matters can stay in usage for a very long time which is like is anybody getting value I measure value based on usage uh I figure out the right patterns of usage you know daily weekly what whatever the case may be what is an active user how do I Define that so I think the one metric that matters can stay there for quite some time which is an actionable sort of thing once it goes to revenue um it it gets uh it gets trickier you know one of the case studies um we had um like net customers like daily like net customers on a daily basis was was what one company was had as their metric so not Revenue because that's like really abstracted but they used um uh net customers so it's like how many customers came on versus churned at any given point in time so like that's a number where it's still hard to action because if it's going down it means people are churning or sales are crappy like I don't know where the problem is but at least I can go and try to figure out where it is off of like a health indicator yeah you said something else in passing just now that I want to shine a light on for the founders listening to this because I no one shined a light on it for me and it it burned me a couple of times trying to like rally teams around data you you mentioned really quickly defining what the data point is or I think even more specifically like defining very granularly how we're going to measure the piece of data that we're aligning behind I is it's gotten me so many times we give things a cute name like an mql or this or that you ask five different people what they are yeah and you know one person it's a demo on the calendar one person it's the week the demo is going to show up one person knows that we filter by a geographic criteria and nobody else knows it you know and so it's it's one of those bits of work that's super unsexy but like getting to the point where whatever organizational metrics you really care about actually defining them so everybody knows how we're what we're talking about you know I think is it's one of those hidden bits of work that can really mess up and you you see it I see that a lot in um in later stage I'm not talking gigantic comp right but even like series a companies because now they have departments yes and you know a user a customer is supposed to flow through the Departments like from sales to or from marketing to sales to customer success right and they're not like they're not actually speaking the same language most of the time and I do think data can be a common language that everybody should understand because most of these definitions of things should be relatively easy for people like I'm not talking like hardcore data analysis just like what you said Matt like what is an mql yeah like can we just agree the one that gets me all the time is active user yes yes that's that's the one right like that's the like what the hell is an active user and most of the time people really struggle to Define that because they actually because they're not even sure the frequency of usage that should drive value yeah and and so like if you don't know how many times somebody's supposed to use the product or how they're supposed to even use the product to get the value use product get value should be ideally a simple equation like how do you measure active at that point and and now we're into an even more fundamental question which is like are you creating value I don't I don't know which is like are you even solving a problem that matters like oh now we're really in trouble right so that's what I loved about your maturity model was like it's is like I enjoy this like I like play with spreadsheets for fun Johnny probably would have beat me up before in high school right but um right it's it's so tempting for people who enjoy this kind of work to grab something that works really really well for a later Stage Company and apply it to your kitchen table siiz startup you know it's just it's a it's like trying to kill a fly with a sledgehammer you know and so I love I love that the the daily active users or active users example is a great one because right you just heard my slip like you might pick daily active users because you're at a blog post that that's what Facebook measures so you're like well must work for Facebook but right you might be driving massive value for a user that logs in every 14 days but you've never paused to actually chew on that for a minute that maybe that's the behavior we're trying to create so we should be measuring it over over a two we period I want to I want to double click on on one thing just to help paint we're we've talked at a theoretical level and I I still want to help close the gap for the founder who either what act what are they tactically doing on a day-to-day basis that they say hey I'm driving behavior based on this data driven focusing on the one metric that matters most like are they over a spreadsheet on a regular basis is there a med the PE the companies you work with to do this best is there like a meeting where they decide like this is the metric and if so what's present in that meeting is it is there some way of visualizing the data is it just in a spreadsheet with some traffic lights is it on a canvas where we've like drawn out a simple flywheel of where the metric you know is living right now that matters like help me drop me into the organization that's doing it well so when you say hey if I could clone how they did this and every startup showed up this way we'd have more successful Founders and more Innovation can you help like describe it at a level yeah I think I think where it starts for me is what I what I call a systems diagram of the business which you know like sounds maybe more complicated than it really is but to me that's uh or another way describing is mapping the user or customer journey through the whole um experience they have with your business so if you can do a systems diagram which we did some examples in in lean analytics which is okay uh traffic comes from these sources hits the website they sign up for a free trial they activate by doing X or they you know they become inactive um if they activate they start using the product let's just make that a black box for a minute right okay using the product doing stuff um they pay right so that's another part of the thing or they upgrade or they churn and so if you map out that user Journey uh so that's where I always like to start with with Founders at at almost at any stage it could be early stage um ideally product in Market though because otherwise there's not a lot like to map right but so you're mapping customer acquisition you're mapping how they activate you're mapping what they do in the product um and and how they churn or whatever else happens after um so you start there uh and what I found is a company of two people uh they will draw a different diagram so imagine a company 10 20 30 40 50 people everybody at the company wherever they work should understand how the whole machine operates things come through here they do stuff here they come out here right like everybody should understand that so it starts with a systems diagram I've seen this done on a whiteboard right like as an exercise just to get everybody aligned I've also seen it in murro or mural or Google drawing or some other digital format where you literally map the whole thing once you've mapped it you get together with the team and you're like where is it broken the most like where do we have to focus the most right now and so that's a conversation of like again maturity model and Stage like let's just be honest about where we are and so you know an example would be we don't have to worry about upselling people right now because we haven't even gotten anybody to buy anything yet right simp simple example so to me it's visual first like a systems diagram oh that's the machine that's how the and if I poke here shit's going to happen over here too right um and what that allows you to do is like between each step in the journey there's a metric you can measure uh you know so obviously conversion metrics through a funnel activation metrics so so now I can sort of map the nodes the steps and I can map the metrics then I can have a strategic conversation with the team around where is this the most broken um and if I then we can go and run experiments on that yeah now it's like to me then it's a dashboard uh and like I I'm tool tic for the most part right so I need a dashboard and with the one metric that matters in the middle like okay great there's other data but like what's the one thing we're going to if we focus here we run a bunch of experiments here what's the number that's going to tell us these experiments are working or not working right we've increased daily active use we've reduced churn we've done something then if I get that to a level that I'm happy with and again how to define happy on that I have to look at benchmarks online I can talk to peers talk to my investors I can just I honestly I think to some extent it's like diminishing returns on experiments I've kind of hit a level where I'm like I can't get it any higher than this or lower than this I'm just going to move on but then the map lets me say fix problem a then logically people are going to get to step B and I'm going to have to go f so systems diagram um simple dashboard again that could be any any format but to me the getting everybody understanding the same thing is really the key uh like everybody should understand how the business works and it's shocking how often that's not true yeah man I I could not agree more I love how you I love I can imagine working in that environment um I love how you drill that down to a tactical level um I kind of I I want to share methodology that we've been working on and get your thoughts on this okay so we we we talk about the grow ceiling for a sass company we're typically working with the SAS company somewhere between 100K in annual revenue to 10 million in annual revenue but the bulk are between like 100k in annual and 2 million so by most people's definition still pretty early stage we see three main levers right you've got we turn ceiling is how many customers I acquiring you know what's my turn how much are they worth and we can kind of plot when's the business going to hit the ceiling and we what we're working through is you plug in the numberers see the ceiling and then so now we got to decide which lever is most impactful for us to work on and of course under each one if I decide to work on acquisition there's like 10 more levers that we have to consider is it traffic is it conversion whatever how regardless we just say the first layer we've got to pel back is the figure which one one of these three so then we we move into a um almost like an impact confidence and ease like what how confident are you that you could if pricing uh if we could fix your pricing and make customers twice as valuable as they are what's the confidence level you could have on that so if we put in what do we think we could do and how confident are we now we can chart and say okay well based on those inputs we should focus on acquisition first is there some parts it sounds like the answer is yes there's some parts uh science and then there's also now I have to take into the stuff that doesn't make its way into a spreadsheet of like how how how much more challenging is the next increment of improvement um how I guess to some my question how easy is it for you to drive consensus in the organization is there still some like oh it it may not just be a single metric that matters it could be you know two or three and we just got to pick the one that we want to focus on most right now we have the highest degree of confidence there's some you know lwh hanging fruit in this area we can make quick work of it and come back and and Tackle number two yeah I I think um the one metric that matters like is is uh like both it's it's something I I think people should really try to get to but also a message of simplify the data and simplify the decision making so like would you ever eliminate tracking everything just to say let's pick one number and roll the dice no uh but instead of getting caught in sort of an analysis paralysis with the data you're collecting so I think what you're talking about here Johnny for me is like how do I prioritize and prioritization is is hard so I think you know what you've described is a is a good way of thinking through that I think there's always an element of like confidence is an element of gut right so that's going to be pattern matching things I've done before where I'm like oh yeah another company I was at we figured this out and it was actually churn that was the kill killer and so we lowered churn and then that gave us you know let's call it permission SL theability to go acquire more customers I think to some extent some of it's logical uh you know and the systems diagram model of it helps you sort of take a step back and visualize and be like where are the hot spots here um I think Founders um struggle with the idea of like like hardcore prioritization because it's what if something else is the right thing so now we're more into a yeah you got to use your gut sometimes and you've got to keep the experiments short so I think that's the other component to it which is look we're prioritizing so we can execute work we're not prioritizing because we're 100% sure we're guaranteed to to be right so I get nervous like I i' I've seen companies run experiments for like months and I'm like I don't know like you better be you better be right at that point but if you tell me this is going to take two weeks to do it's like what the hell like what's the worst that could happen like we're wrong fine we invested two weeks we probably learned something well we learned something we were wrong you know uh and maybe out of that a better experiment idea a better prioritization approach comes you know emerges and and that helps us so I think prioritization always hard but easier if you're if you're doing things quickly yeah it's so interesting we when we run Founders through this gross ceiling the visualization you know 50% of the effect is actually seeing the numbers and taking a data driven approach we picking the other half of the impact is just in that they have counted the costs or the opportunities of the other thing of the other things they could be focusing on and rather than trying to make the right decision they have the confidence to just go make the decision right oh I decided to tackle pricing that means I'm not focused on churn and on acquisition we are just going to nail our pricing optimization in this next Sprint and uh I found that that commitment the um the ability to set down the fear of missing out on having focus on another opportunity is just as impactful as picking the right thing um I totally agree with that yeah I totally agree with that and I would say like in my experience and you you guys probably seen this also like as companies grow and they raise more Capital they hire more people uh that that's usually what what folks do and then they they those people get a bit siloed and then everybody starts chasing their own priority and then eventually the founder or Founders you know X number of months later say God we're actually going slower than we were before um it's I think it's literally happens every single time so I don't know that talking about it fixes it but nevertheless here we go and and that's a too many people with too many priorities all running all trying to be successful nobody's trying to kill the business but they're all chasing their own things and they and they go like this and and that I've seen that kill companies before and so you know to me it's like the the the the key is just pick something and go and then do it fast do it well learn from it and if you're wrong fine but when you get a 100 people and they've got 20 priorities then then you're probably doomed you back I think we lost you there for a sec little Frozen yeah little Frozen I don't know what's going on the last part you uh you mention or last thing I caught was like when you have uh 100 people and you have 20 priorities and then it and then it cut off um yeah it's my what's going on oh wait you guys there yeah we're here we got you okay yeah all I was saying was you know when you've got 100 people and 20 priorities and everybody's running in a different direction that that almost always ends in some version of failure yeah uh and so to me again like the the goal here use the data that you have but at the end of the day M like making a decision on what to go chase is the most important part of it as long again as long as that's doesn't take that long to do you know like don't don't make six-month long commitments and then be wrong because then you've you've probably killed the business yeah I love it um so we're talking about speed and I feel like you could sum that up and like not forgetting to behave like a startup but I'd love to I'd love to switch gears and talk about the earliest of startups and what you're doing in the Venture Studio world right one of the reasons I was really stoked about this episode you just get your hands into so much stuff man it's a lot of cool places we can go um but I think a good point to start with on this for our audience can you just walk through at a high level like what does a venture Studio do and how like when would a Founder want to work with one when is it a good idea maybe just set the table and then we'll sure go from there yeah I think I think the my my I'm going to say like my definition of venture Studio because uh it is one of those terms uh that is now means a whole bunch of different things to a whole bunch of different people and that's okay that doesn't that's fine like who am I to be like I own the I don't own the term Venture Studio but for me it's building and funding companies from zero so so you got to be able to build them and you have to be able to write a check uh so it's the combination of those two two things from from zero which is the VE day one so so that's how I like at a high level that's how I would Define it you're seeing Studios that are more on the build side um so you know folks like um Dev shops software companies Studio like product Studios that are um rebranding perhaps as Venture Studios because you know that term is having a bit of a a bit of a moment but for me it's the building and the funding from zero um uh so that's how I would Define it the methodology by which you do that uh you know that can of course vary and there's a whole bunch of different nuances inside of okay well how do you go about doing that but to me that's the fundamental got it and what um like what's the prototypical founder that you end up working with first time second time some type of experience like who do you look for yeah we it's been a mix for us uh you know so and and other Studios will have other sort of parameters around how they Define it most I would say are looking for repeat Founders that shouldn't be a terrible surprise because that's what everybody is looking for including investors so most of the time people are looking for repeat Founders we've done quite a bit with firsttime Founders um not exclusively uh repeat Founders but um so for us it's a it's a couple of um criteria we would look at one is uh um if you're not if you're a first-time founder we need you to be an expert in the space or the vertical that you're going into like I I we can't work with a Founder who says I want to go um you know solve sustainability uh because I care but I I I I know nothing about that right so first-time founder you have to be a domain expert that's often um uh like a a a a veteran of an industry I've worked 20 years in banking I'm I'm I'm sick of it I can't handle it anymore uh I've seen all the problems I I I got to go start a company but I've never started a company but I know the industry maybe I've got some money set aside so I can kind of afford to take a swing so that's one kind of version the other is the repeat founder been there done that and and those folks you can put into an industry or a vertical where they may not have experience but they they understand what it means to build a company um for us it's typically a solo founder uh but not always so you know often it's a solo founder to begin the journey and then we're typically working with Founders for about six to nine months during the course of that time we're bringing in um often it's a non-technical founder and then we bring in a technical founder once we know what the you know what we're actually building and what we're doing so we like them to leave the studio with a team but but often it starts with a solo founder uh and and what I would say is these are um age doesn't matter really although I mentioned experience in one thing um I think Studios have an appeal to more diverse Founders who don't have the same level of access to stuff that other folks would have like if you can get into why combinator Aventure Studio probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense to you um but but there's a whole swath of potential Founders that don't have access to that or don't live in the valley or don't know a ton of investors or didn't do an MBA at a top school right so that that's another component of the founder profile that I think studios are a good fit for I love that um and can you walk through on average I know that's probably a spectrum but like on average what does it look like like what kind of check sizes is event Studio putting in um what's the equity breakdowns look like or ask the question more directly what is a Founder gaining and giving up by working with a Founder with a venture Studio yeah and and uh it it does vary a lot and so my my advice to anybody listening who's looking at Studios is do your homework uh on the studios themselves like really research them understand what they do look at their portfolios talk to Founders that they've worked with because that'll be the best reference that you can do so you got to do your homework generally what we see our studios are taking um 20 to 40% is kind of the range on the on the 40 starts to get pretty high uh for for me like personally like I find that a little bit on the high end um but 20 to 40% some will be a little bit lower than that um that will be a combination usually of Sweat Equity I some portion for the services that you're going to receive those Services can vary and then a portion of that should be for Capital as well again this is where I think the capital piece becomes really important if you're getting zero dollars but you're getting just free like um service for Equity it can get sketchy really quick I'm not saying the studios that do that are are all bad I'm just saying it can get sketchy really quickly right naive founder maybe a first timer never done it before all of a sudden somebody comes along says give me 20% of the company I'm going to create all this value you know Money Talks at this point right so combination the amount of money um varies quite a bit so you know I would say it's um typically it's going to be 150k 250k first check in some will go up to a million bucks maybe even more if they have a fun structure they might be doing like 500 okay and then let's get this thing to launch and then we will follow on right so they could have a follow on structure depending on the um funds that they have so that's high level I can give you highlight beta's numbers quickly um like so we're by the way our numbers have changed on almost all our deals like I've never found one perfect model yeah um so we we still iterate on ours but we're typically about 10% on The Sweat Equity side and then we're putting in call it about 250 um uh like company we we incorporate the company yeah open up a bank account put about 250 in let's say right sometimes a little bit less than that um depends on the needs maybe there's friends and family at that point they're putting in we don't want to over dilute so we typically are around 18 to 20% and then we will follow on usually we think about that like let's get this thing to launch get the product built get it to Market get the initial traction and then we put in let's say another 250 so we're kind of the first 500 of a million doll preedee is kind of how we think about it um but again there's a lot of there's there's variables there yeah you know I've done quite a bit of um it's a model that fascinates me and has for years and one of the one of the foundational I guess differences of opinion that I'm I've seen out there on the on the interwebs from Venture Studio Founders is the right way to to pick the idea pick the founder and match them together and I feel like there's really two schools of thought on this the first one is you know we're going to incubate the idea internally maybe do some super early validation and then go search for the right person to be the quote unquote founder to drive the ball forward then I think the other school of thought are the people who are interested in the person bringing their own idea probably with the thought that the psychology is going to be a little bit you know be more strongly bonded to your idea because you came up with it so I'm curious do you have a preference do you guys create the ideas and find the founders do you want the founders to come with the ideas like what are your thoughts on what works best yeah we do both that's the simple you know like there's two schools of thought and I'm I'm in both schools uh that's that's how we do it so uh We've we've done we have we've done both um we have a third uh element to ours which is in some cases we're working with big corporate Partners we're validating the opportunity with them and then spinning it out so off the back of the work we do with a big company where part of that thesis is let's Leverage The assets they have customers data Capital domain expertise industry access can we leverage those assets to build net new companies that are benefiting from the corporate partner that helped instigate um so in that case it's sort of us doing the work first but with a corporate then finding a Founder we we do our own validation work in certain areas that we're interested in and then we'll look for a Founder um in in that model we tend to do that very quickly so this is where it's kind of like in the middle between founder with an idea and us with an idea so some studios will do like a year of validation work then bring somebody in and arguably at that point they're bringing an operator in right which is fine like if you if that's your model so be it they'll definitely take more equity in that case if we're chasing something on our own I would like to bring a Founder in within three months and and the argument there is kind of like look we've done something we have some Instinct that there's something here but we need somebody to pick this ball up and run with it and own it and that's why we tend to give the founder most of the equity in the company in exchange for the fact that we haven't done an enormous amount of work I also think if you do a year of validation you're still probably wrong on any number of variables anyway so you're still making a bet on the founders ability to win so at that point you might as well just incorporate faster put the money in and and run um so corporate we do our own but we also do look for Founders who have started to do their own validation work and I describe that as like a Founder that's almost ready to jump off the cliff but not 100% ready to jump off the cliff and we'll jump off with them so we do all of those um and it it just depends on any number of like the situation at the time cool I like I like it I like where you're at about the the good idea is the good idea let's figure out the specifics around it right you're optimizing for the quality yeah and if you look at and by the way if you look at our portfolio and I were to go through like company by company and say this one we incubated found a Founder this one founder came to us I don't first of all our portfolio is quite young still right so like TBD but off air if you ask me like like I think it would be a mixed bag I'd have to go one by one and be like oh we incub one like we've done um 18 Investments uh nine of those have been companies we built from scratch nine were just flat out preed Investments um of the nine we've done the the one we did with a corporate partner then recruited the founder was our first exit cool so I I TBD on portfolio performance I think will say this like I think if you bring the founder in early enough and they really are passionate about the space and you know that they're probably going to Pivot later on anyway I have not been overly concerned about how invested that founder is you know that the argument of like oh it wasn't their idea they didn't you know they didn't dream it up so therefore they don't care I I call BS on that a little bit if if it's the right person with the right mix of ingredients and they have the right upside in and incentives yeah so there's a few ifs there but that's I I just not black and white like find me a formula for building successful companies and and we'll just all do that but since it doesn't exist we'll just make it up as we go yeah Ben I heard you say in in a recent podcast that you prefer investing in the company as early as possible because it takes away from the only um successful outcome being that they're a unicorn they reach massive Heights that you actually get to participate earlier and even it does the is your model that you know when they raise the next round do you do you exit your share of the company at that point do you get to decide whether or not you stay on and after I thought it was super interesting that that you had to avoid the need for you to go you know one for a hundred on these like big swings and it still make sense having you know the 99 that don't work out it sounded like you you like playing a a a role much earlier on and that even that next round of funding represents a great win for the Venture studio and it doesn't mean that the founder has to come in dreaming up a hundred million dollar business idea um is that first off feel free to correct me if I'm wrong if I have an articulator point of view correctly and then is does that say more about just your enjoyment of that stage of company or about what you think you know later stage VC the pressure it puts on the business and the founder and just the model in general yeah I I I'm glad you asked about the enjoyment part because uh honestly I I can't imagine being an invest and I say that and then you'll we'll talk in 10 years I'll be like yeah now I'm a serious B investor but I I don't think that'll happen like reserve the right to change your mind oh good thank goodness um uh but I I I love the zero to one it's almost all I've ever done and so I I can't imagine being a series a series B seriousy like later stage investor it just I it's like too much math honestly uh so it's just not it's not exciting I like the the creation of stuff it's why we started the studio in the first place was like I love investing in in in Founders at the earliest stage because I love helping other people achieve their Vision but I also like building companies I don't like just sitting there sort of writing checks and I I think that creates a weird it is a weird dynamic right like oh I have all the money you have no money and therefore come begging for money is like just a shitty experience for everybody so I like building too um so so the enjoyment part is is a key um I think the the answer to the other part of the question on the sort of the outcomes and the math for us we think about it as optionality so probably don't try to get out on the next round but I would say at the series a level if there is an opportunity for a secondary or to sell a portion of our shares um we would look at that because at the end of the day our job is to return cash to our investors and so like we have investors they want to return and so if we can get out a portion early uh we would certainly look at that if that option is available to us and because we own let's say a disproportionately high amount of equity um compared to maybe like certainly more than an angel would own right like if you're writing Angel checks and you own own I don't know like 1% or below um you know we own let's say 18% uh some in common Su in preferred shares and so do we exit the common stake at that point you know so um that amount of equity that we own um affords us the opportunity to maybe get out early it also means that if there are early exits uh those can still be material from again a cash onh return basis now that doesn't work if our fund size is gigantic right like if we had a I mean I don't know what gigantic would be but even a hundred million fund which is actually not gigantic but let's imagine for a moment we had a100 million fund you can't early exit your way to to Big returns like you better hit some bloody gigantic home runs right but we're not necessarily playing an assets under management game I like we're not trying to grow a $100 million fund on management fees then a $500 million fund fund and oh crap now we need a billion dollars fund so we play a different game which allows us to generate return off early exits and again that's all just optionality if if we see something that's going to take off and we want to ride it we'll ride it like I have no problem like we we need some big wins too right you can't five million to10 million exit your way to Victory here you got to have a couple of big wins as well um but again optionality to to make those kinds of choices that are good for us good for our investors good for the founder also you know like again like I just I I I'm just super founder friendly or Le at least I think I am I'm saying that but like ask my co-founder he'd be like Ben you're too founder friendly I'm like yeah because I was a founder and it's hard and so if we can help them you know like a $20 million exit for somebody who owns 60% of a business is lifechanging money who am I to tell that no no don't take that let's ride it no man take take the money like take the money you know I that one I love it yeah yeah where so you this is an interesting component you have when you're incubating or when you have an idea you want to go chase down you're hiring someone who is essentially going to be a Founder right like how's that job description written up yeah and where do you find them yeah no so you know what we couple of different ways that we've done it um often what we do is we call it a Founder in Residence and we say come come in work with us let's say for about three months and let's date I think of that as a dating period you have to like us we have to like you so we're dating we're also dating the idea right so it's like it's a bit of a three-way um uh situation and uh and and so we do that and we hire them as contractors basically to start most of the time and then we get to this sort of no-go decision which is do we really like this person do they like us do we want to work together and do we have enough conviction in this opportunity if we really like the person we we've invalidated the idea we'll just go chase something else with them if we don't like the person or they don't like us we just break up and we move on with our lives right so that that's part of it like you can't do that with a hundred people to get one business right you have to be pretty good at like that it can't be a really sharp funnel yeah because otherwise you just be You' just be killing yourself working with folks um and then on the recruiting it's by any means necessary so this is mostly Network mostly referrals but we've done job postings on link mostly LinkedIn as well and and that I I that's my like rattle shake the tree strategy and see what falls out of the tree right because as as the popularity of venture Studios goes up and in our case like as highlight beta's brand gets bigger and more wellknown you put out a job posting we're looking for a Founder in Residence focused on uh Enterprise Insurance you are going to get good quality candidates just Ben what are you doing what's going on and and and that's so um recruiters like some studios use recruiters for this because they you know you just need so it's like any means necessary to recruit uh we get it wrong a bunch like that's totally fair um you know bring somebody in who's excited by the concept of a venture Studio but then they don't fall in love with the idea you know and they're just like I don't have the stomach for this like I I I can't dedicate the next five to 10 years of my life to this thing I'm like I totally get that and then we would have to go look for somebody else so it's it's a real mishmash yeah it makes a ton of sense I like the we recently started using a a term that we learned from Jason Cohen over at WP engine called a tour of Duty for uh like certain promotions or new positions inside the company where we're like not 100% not 100% sure that this role is going to continue to exist or this is the right person so let's put a label on it that makes uh makes if we decide to Pivot from this idea keeps it from feeling like failure and more so by design that it was it's one of the two outcomes we think is going to happen and in some scenarios it's actually more likely than it actually working out so let's make sure that we can all be friends and and we minimize the shrapnel if we do have to to go a different direction so I love that I I also want to unpack you this so in SAS Academy we have about 70% of our clients will be um you know firsttime Founders they've got some vertical experience um TR I would call it a traditional founder path the other 30% of people that we've worked with they come from service from agencies or from service based companies or or from more established companies and they're trying to either incubate or spin out a a SAS product and I failure is way more common than not in those not because they were bad ideas but because it's so challenging for them to actually dedicate the right person you know energy Etc to the the new thing when the main thing works so well like no matter how bad an agency owner doing three five million wants to get out of the agency and spend off this SAS product they can just never quite feel confident enough to make the leap and so it just keeps getting all the left over time but you have a whole half of what you're doing at Highline is focused on this this side or maybe it's not half but it's a it's enough for you to say there's two parts of the business and one of them is incubation so what have you learned about the the corporations that successfully do this what's true inside that company that is absent from the ones that have just you know a graveyard full of great ideas that never came to life yeah oh my it it's it's so hard to do what you're describing uh from the agency and funnily enough uh my first company was a web agency back in I started in 96 so it's a long long time ago built a web agency small uh we were Aqua hired by a bigger web agency in like 98 and you know chugging along and then we see.com crash coming and we like we better find another way to make money because all these crazy doc projects are going to go are going to disappear and this is a day when building an e-commerce website by the way was like $400,000 whereas now it's $29.95 per month right like just just Bonkers so we actually pivoted from agency to um uh software company we built project management software uh and and started selling that and people were actually buying it but balancing both like we I I live that experience it's so brutal uh and like we did pivot completely to the to the product but it never grew that much so I I wouldn't even say that that we did it that successfully but I've I've lived that experience um and it's really hard to some extent we live that experience like you said you know like today because we have a an agency model right that's a Consulting business that's how it generates revenue and we have a studio where we earn Equity so one generates Revenue one generates Equity um we had to build it up to a point where we had enough dollars that we we could have a separate team dedicated to the studio so like this is a long-winded answer but that's where we had to get to but it was also always our mission to build and fund companies so it also took us a couple of years to raise a venture capital fund so we started the business let's just generate Revenue let's pay ourselves something let's um hire people let's grow Revenue like any agency but always with the with the intent of building companies and investing in companies but we had to get the fund in place and other things and then have enough Revenue we could hire people uh so you know if you're if you're running an agency like what you described like three to five million bucks uh you're NE honestly like it's almost impossible to dedicate the time because you have you can take this work on for 100 bucks or you could spend 100 bucks building this thing you're always going to R you're always going to pick the $100 from revenue so you can you can do it by dedicating people to it you can do it by pulling the shoot right just like that's it here we go like give up the service business the other option I think and and again depends on your setup is hire somebody to run the service business which is tough for agencies to do but actually at Highline beta that's in in part where we got to like we put somebody in charge her name's Paige um she's been with us a long time and we put her in charge of the service business basically and said like look I'm still involved my co-founder is still involved of course but we said look I can't run that and run the studio and raise Capital all you know we just can't do all those things so you're better at this than we are anyway so you can level people up in the OR to take over parts so you can go commit over here uh but I mean that's sounds easy but it's obviously very difficult to do yeah the service the service base one is very common I've even seen it and I'm curious of the of the ones that you have even bigger like we work with a company that dig close to 80 million a year and they had four or five people assigned to a tech product and they had already put in more than half a million dollars into the product itself and even still like they have this kind of internal CEO of the product and even still it's it's very very difficult we've tried putting the label on the bottle to say look this thing these things have to be true a person at minimum has to be accountable for the success of this project and nothing else inside the company anything else inside the company it's going to keep on getting focus um I'm curious if you've distilled a couple of principles that you say like when we're working with a larger more established business these things have to be true in order for us to even have a chance there's already enough once you get the people in the room and try to go launcher thing is already enough but now you add this additional headwind of that there is a known path to creating profit that often times has a lot less resistance than the new one the new one might have this interesting ability to disrupt the main business and becomes a new thing there's situations that there's it could be a whole another business and something is sellable asset lots of benefit to it but sometimes that zero to one inside the bigger company is more challenging when you've seen it work what were some of the patterns that you even look for now I'm sure you have to decide you know Highline when do we dedicate resources to something or not when you're talking to these prospective you know established companies what gets you excited and then what is like oh this is I'm aware of where this ends they may not be that but this isn't the right one you know may not the right one for us yeah even with big companies like you know small agency you have the same you have a sort of a lack of resource problem as the company gets bigger it's not necessarily a lack of resource right oh we have a person dedicated there is a budget we still can't pull it off that's a combination of things sometimes it's honestly the talent it's just not the right people to do zero to one you know if you're an80 million business the there were Founders and maybe they're still operating the company and they remember what 0 to1 was but they didn't necessarily hire a whole bunch of 0o to1 people we've seen that in big big companies right like our clients tend to be multinationals super talented people super smart people they're just not zero to one people and so taking a high performer from a bank and saying you now are going to go build startups it doesn't high performance over here doesn't mean high performance over here so Talent is one of them often if people are if companies are trying to systematize this sort of like corporate Venture Studio model we encourage them to hire from the outside and balance it like imagine um you have a a team dedicated to new building new vent half of them should be internal folks so they understand the machine they can call in favors when they need them but half of them have to be from the outside more entrepreneurial who are like I I want to leverage these assets and and punch a hole in that space so so Talent is one I think the way capital is deployed is also broken in most of those models so most big companies $80 million company also would be this probably the same way annual budget uh and like that makes sense we can plan right obviously gigantic companies like you know they plan well in advance like what they're doing but you know zero to1 startups don't work that way and so you you don't have the right budgeting mechanism so it's like okay I need to know exactly where we're going to be in a year and budget that so I'll over budget probably hire more people than I need because if I don't I'm not going to get the budget uh and then if it starts to take off well there's no more budget so I can't grow now uh or if it's going sideways I'll pretend it's okay because if I tell them I don't need this budget they won't give it to me next year so the it's not budgeting like a this is where an investor mentality uh helps which is okay I know this is not a spin out I know this is not an investable opportunity let's say for a company like Highline beta but let's put an investor mindset on this thing what's the smallest amount of money we need to get an MVP in Market 50 bucks that's what we get 50 bucks right Let's ignore salaries for a moment right 50 bucks great what's the next stage traction how do we so now it's just going back to those basic principles of good zero to one execution but also the mentality of oh that's kind of like a seed round uh so let and and so the deploying of capital is also often broke out of necessity the way they deploy Capital not the right way um the the last part here and this one's really difficult is incentive models so incentive models in big companies are not obviously not the same as incentive models in startups startups you're doing it not for a big salary or the benefits you get um or the 401K you're doing it for the upside and in new Ventures inside of a big corporate entity there is usually no upside and so uh that's great because you have the security of working at a big company but you have none of the motivation to grow that thing materially and then the other unended consequence is big companies never fail obviously big companies fail all the time but they never fail right like they they they spend millions and millions of dollars on on stuff that doesn't work and it just gets swept under the rug maybe somebody gets loses their job but unlike small startups that are like experiment fail learn learn experiment fail learn on and on and on big companies don't operate that way so now you've put somebody in charge and said you go do this knowing that 80% of the time you're going to fail on the chance that 20% of the time you're going to get it right the consequence of that is that that employee thinks to himself or herself or themsel I can't fail like the I have to build a business so now they just execute some nonsensical plan to make it look like they're building a business right if you tell people you got to go do that thing God forbid you'd come back and be like that was a stupid idea I invalidated it and a big company rarely understands how to accept that or I don't like celebrate it but accept it as part of the journey so like those are the anyway again a long answer but those are the components that make it very difficult in now it's doable like again like I I love seeing companies try to incubate new things and I think every big company needs to F try to build their own stuff they also should be looking at investing and acquiring like all the tools in the toolbox yeah but but those are some reasons why building in house is really tough It's funny because it takes me full circle to something you said in the very beginning when we were talking about data and lean analytics which is like making your small bets on a two week 3 week four-week turn and not a six-month bet and then you look at the the large company who's only making bets on an annual turn when they do budgeting um and it's a it's a total it's the same thing like the ways of working are just so radically different yeah and like I think they understand it right again like people who work in big companies are not stupid they're super smart they're super successful like they built a giant thing or they're part of a giant thing they run a p&amp;l much bigger than any p&amp;l I've ever even seen so like these are really effective people but then zero to one is a a totally different game and there's so many missteps again maybe not colossal failures but so many missteps in that process and they can talk about Innovation that way and say we got to you know apply lean start up or design thinking or jobs to be done but talking about it or understanding the framework and living it are very very different things and uh and then and then the last thing I say is they they're they're not comfortable with portfolio management the way like an investor would be so to me the the the idea is if I'm a big company I've got to start a lot of things and I have to two things I have to realize one is many of them will fail and then the ones that work will still take years to work so if I'm trying to do this to juice my Top Line next year I I'm going to fail I I've had conversations with companies where they'll say things like we want to build a corporate Venture Studio or we want to do something because I'm being tasked with generating $200 million more in Revenue in five years I'm like well that's a that's very ambitious goal very exciting I'm like you should just go buy a company that makes $20 million a year right now and juice a 10x because you're never going to incubate enough Little Things to generate $200 million in five years like what are you talking about like that's a unicorn on top of a unicorn you know what I mean like I'm talking Revenue not I'm not talking valuation I'm talking right actual dollars 200 million five years I'm like you better just go buy something right now to get there right so portfolio management patience these are also things that bigger companies struggle with especially public ones because they got earnings yeah uh reports to do so it's interesting my I have a a specific question on this because this just the the Paradigm between big company thinking and zero to one thinking always fascinates me how do you or what advice would you give to a big company who's struggling with the tension between I want to start something should I build it as like an internal tool and try to spin it out later or should I focus on the market opportunity and you know the vend diagram sits where it sits right like how do you how do you see companies try reconcile that yeah I mean the the simple answer is hire Highline beta first and we will solve all of your problems so that's that's our tagline right so that's yeah and can't edit this piece out right but uh the the way I think about it is uh so big companies like really big companies will often have an m&amp;a team like a Corp Dev team they'll sometimes they'll have a a CBC a corporate Venture Capital group they'll have any number of innovation teams as well and they all unfortunately work in silos typically so the m&amp;a team is tasked with going in acquiring some businesses the CBC team is tasked with investing The Innovation team is tasked with building I would prefer or I prefer I I think the better way of doing it is let's go validate the opportunities in the market first so right back to the first principles what's the problem who has it is the problem painful enough for people to buy or use uh you know buy with their money or their data or their time do we have a right to playwin in this space and then what's the right way of doing it so if we believe there's a big enough problem we believe we have a right to play or win in the space we believe the market is interesting enough and strategic to us and we believe we can build a solution it's feasible for us to do something in the space sometimes there are regulatory compliance legal issues there now what's the right way build buy partner spin out or invest so to me the the best scenario is a small team it's like a Black Ops Team their whole job is to validate problems and then strategically figure out if our company let's say whatever company you work for has the right to play and win in that space and then decide what's the right way of realizing that thing so you know while you're doing that early Discovery into a problem or or an opportunity space you're also looking at the competition you're looking at the where the investment dollars are going you're looking at the startups in that market that's giving you a lens into why build it if we could just buy it or why buy it if we could just partner with it so it's sort of like start fundamental principles validate and then make a decision about how to realize it as opposed to I'm just tasked with buying stuff so I'm just going to buy stuff or I'm tasked with investing in stuff so I'll just invest in stuff so it's just a different way of organizing that work to try to get to using the right tool for the right job makes sense Ben you have shared a tremendous amount of content on on well just over the years in general you're a great follow on Twitter LinkedIn um you write a newslet called the focus chaos or Focus chaos some great resources in fact call out to the earlier part one of the things that I had had found on your site prior to our call was the the deconstructing and mapping the business system so it's great examples if someone wants to see a visual example of what you were sharing great free resource ungated um there which is cool I'd love to hear how are you is this a um a a creative outlet for you that doesn't have to turn into anything or is there are you applying some the lean analytics methodology and and is this does this grow up into a business or of well I'm sure it helps in many parts of your business now I'm curious like what's the primary intent behind what you're creating with the newsletter and focus chaos yeah I I number one for me was I I genuinely enjoy writing uh I find it challenging uh to to write well to to codify thoughts so I just enjoy doing it uh uh so so so I I launched Focus chaos last December I guess I was like I'm just going to do it it had been a while since I had been writing stuff and I and part of it was again ALS actually was having now run Highline beta for almost eight years I was like man Venture studios are getting popular people are talking about this a lot I've run one for eight years I think I have a perspective that could be interesting to other folks so mostly enjoy writing enjoy sharing uh helping others um genuinely en enjoy that um then the other part was just back to experimentation so I was like I'm just going to use substack what the hell let's see I haven't used you know I was like I don't want to use WordPress too complicated I want lightweight like let me just experiment you know so it's like partially that just experimenting with stuff uh and then and then I think third is I think the brand building exercise around something like Focus chaos does help Highline beta so strategically there is a good fit there without sort of trumpeting Highline beta Highline beta Highline beta and being salesy about it uh would not my strong suit U doing it through something like Focus chaos it it actually does help and then LinkedIn of course you know more than X or Twitter really like is is where the audience is for a Highline beta or or myself so fun like doing it challenging experimentation there's value I don't have uh I never had any intent of turning Focus chaos into a business but I do I think a lot about I just haven't done anything around experimenting with monetization just to try so actually one thing I just launched was a jaw board for Venture Studios I saw that that's cool yeah and I was like because you know what people started coming to me and saying how do I get a job at a venture Studio I was like that's a good question and then I wrote a thing in the newsletter about it and then more people started asking me and I was like that's that's a good question uh back to some of the earlier conversation they're all different I how do I find them like oh what the hell let me launch a jaw board so found some software launched it in a day put a pay wall on it of 25 bucks for job posting just to see if anybody would pay uh some people have paid most people don't want to pay because there's no traffic but that's also experimentation so not really to build a gigantic job board Empire uh but I did run a company in the recruitment space many years ago which was a failure uh and so I have sort of some PTSD around that and so the jaw board is a bit of an outlet so again a long-winded sort of story but no grand plan to uh really monetize Focus chaos which is why I I don't gate stuff but I May someday turn monetization on just to see what that experiment is like I'd be curious to see but there's a limit how much content I can create so you know that's what had me asking the question you have your hands in so many you have you know a lot going on with the the the portfolio you have and the the methodology you've taken be one thing if you said hey I've got a fund and I write checks and so you're evaluating deal flow but like you're you're in at the most challenging stage of a business actively taking on a a co-founder in a high support role yeah you're still producing content and I think Matt and I have been uh indiv you know individually on our own uh kind of Swan Dive Into creating content more frequently and and through that have gained a real appreciation of you have convinced as many of our Founders as possible to go do the same because the founder Le brand is really a really it's incredibly powerful and um compelling compared to the more salesy approach like just you show your work talk about how you're doing this and so um but we often times get to oh I'm I'm early stage on the one business are running and they don't have enough time to create content yet you've got you know your hands and a handful of them and you're still creating content so wanted to ask about the why why you felt like it was important and I think there is an element of find the version of it that is produces energy that is exciting for you there's an element of of the writing side you said helps clarify some of the thinking and and you just take joy and satisfaction in which I think has it shows through in your work man it's like really I appreciate that it's also by the way very good for networking uh so that that was the other one you know as you were describing it Johnny like founder Le uh marketing which I I agree with very good for networking and you know since writing lean analytics like there's been so much more amazing quality content great operators and practitioners sharing their processes their benchmarks how they think about things like a real evolution of stuff and I was like I got to get back in the game if you will of connecting with these thought leaders and influencers and people trying to collectively move the tech industry let's say forward so part of it was also just reconnecting and meeting a bunch of really interesting people in in in my business like I often say it's really just the business of connecting dots and you kind of never know when one dot will connect to another Dot thought it so unlike a running one startup where you're you go super deep I'm I'm you know um more shallow in more things and that means more dot connecting which means got to make more connections got to meet more people and I'm pretty lousy at networking in person so for me networking online through content is my way of connecting with folks in a in a meaningful way it's creating in its most like it's a through line in all of what you're doing right if you think about if you want to be great at creating value in our society like we can do that and by creating businesses which have so many little like you know things that have to fall in place you could also take the time to sit down and write a really wellth thought out blog post right or or article and I love that it's building that muscle so if this is there's a Founder listening that says maybe I should finally open the laptop and share something it's you you're at the end of the day you're in the game of creating value this is a awesome playground to go do that at a very micro scale to then go figure out how to take the bigger swings and um you know build the businesses The Venture Studios so Ben this has been a super fun conversation I feel like uh you told me 10 years ago that I'd be you know sitting down with the author lean analytics and jamming for a little bit I would have told you you were crazy still talking and still talking about lean analytics by the way as you were as you were talking there Johnny I was like but I'm no Dan Martell like that now that guy's a machine like there's there's machines and then there's there's Dan right so like well I think that it's a I think in Dan would say if he was on the podcast with us now it's like do the version that energizes you yes right no don't don't go try to be Dan Martell there's one of those I'll tell you that guy it doesn't does not feel like work for him I spent a lot of hours with Dan I could not do Instagram I'll tell you man like the way like I mean you got to look a certain way too so like kudos to him and the genetics but like man that guy's a that guy's a Content machine and and and like but he's again like this is not a this is not a a Dan Martell Schmo Fest but like that guy's created an insane amount of value for many many people you know like put more value out than you get back but it it comes back it really does and it sounds cheesy a bit but it it does you know you ask me about founder recruiting well guess what like writing Focus chaos attracts Founders to Highline beta it attracts Talent like it attracts co-investors so there's there's method to that Madness and uh and and and that there's reward that comes out of that so yeah it's uh it's a lot of fun yeah well if you guys if you're listening to the episode you made it this far uh you've got to go check out focus chaos uh it is a incredibly well done well written B I'll be following along really enjoyed our conversations today and um appreciate you taking the time yeah thank you guys I really appreciate it was a lot of fun [Music]
