I've been in business for 14 years. I run a portfolio of companies that last year did over $250 million in aggregate revenue. Few months ago, I broke a world record for the fastest selling non-fiction book and generated over $106 million in just under 3 days. Recently, I sat down with a 100 business owners where I shared tactical advice that I've learned from the past decade of business. So, everything from sales to marketing to hiring to productivity and even mindset. And so, I'm going to compress a decade of business knowledge that I've learned into lessons that you can use right now. Starting with number one, you're not disciplined if you like the thing you're doing. So, I'll give you an example. So, I used to work in the fitness industry and I had lots of fitness business owners who'd say like, "I'm so disciplined." Because they were like, "I work out at 5 a.m. every day. I never skip my my meals or my workouts or whatever." But the reality was I would then ask that same business owner, "Hey, how have you been doing with working your leads?" Ah, you know, I haven't been working them as hard as I should. Blah blah blah blah. And so, I would then look at them and say, "You're not disciplined because you only are consistent with the things you like." Discipline is about being able to be consistent with things you don't like. So, here's me going into more depth explaining that exact concept. Do you consider yourself disciplined? uh with things I like, >> right? So that's not discipline, >> right? And so I bring this up because I obviously have talked to trainers and gym owners for a long time. So I I know how to >> Yeah. >> I say this because um I just have a lot of people in the community that I ran be like, you know, I'd see them posting every day like, "God, I have discipline. Up at 5 a.m., like blah blah blah blah." And I'd be like, "You never work your [ __ ] leads, bro. >> Like what are you talking about? You like lifting. You like boxing. That is not hard." It's like I I there it takes no discipline for me to hang out with Ila. Zero. Right. And so because some people don't like hanging out with their wives doesn't mean I have discipline because I do like hanging out with my wife. It just means that they have a shittier life. Right? And so for you it's like you have to this might be a muscle that you haven't used. Like you happen to like boxing and so you did more of it and people said can you help me? And you said sure. If you want to get to where you want to go, your frustration tolerance, meaning your ability to do things that you don't want to do without an immediate reward for an extended period of time, is going to have to get stronger. >> And the good news is that that's a skill. It's not a trait. You can learn it. Which means you do 10 outreaches tomorrow and you're like, "This sucked. Nothing happened." And you say, "Great. Tomorrow I will do 20." >> And then you do 30 and then you do 50 and then you do 100 and you keep going. But I promise you, if you do the rule of 100, which is in that book, >> you do a rule of 100, you and you do that for a 100 straight days, your business will grow. >> Yeah, for sure. >> I And what's crazy is that people actually fully commit to it. And then like way before day 100, they're like, "Holy cow, my whole business has changed." But like, you have to commit to it. You have to go all in on it. And I say it's 4 hours a day. This leads me to business lesson number two. Most already know what to do, but simply don't do it. And the main question is why? Well, number one, because of an inability to delay gratification. Number two, because they don't fully know how to do something. This is the most common reason in more successful business owners. And a business owner asked me this exact question. When all the information is available, why are entrepreneurs still stuck? And so, this is what I told him. I'd say at the most basic level, it's because of an inability to delay gratification. And so, if we just think about like why do humans do things in general, it's because they're they've been rewarded more for doing what they're currently doing rather than changing what they're doing. And I think that makes sense from an evolutionary perspective that like more of what you're currently doing is safe. And so people once they find another point of equilibrium, it's very difficult for them to break out of that even if they're quote like mentally like I really wish I could scale. They they want to want to scale but what they really want is to do what they're currently doing which is why they're doing it. Um and so I think um being able to clearly articulate also like the actions. So how is just like such a simple word. It's a short word but has a lot of like depth to it which is um if I were to talk to a toddler and say I want you to scale a business they would just look at you like what um if you were to tell me hey can you scale this business I'd probably say yeah I can and so the specificity of a request is inversely correlated with the skill of the recipient meaning if you have somebody who has very low skills I have to say like okay here's how you turn on a Once you turn on a computer, then you're going to open up Safari. What's Safari? It's an internet browser. What's the internet? Okay, let's explain what the internet is, right? And then eventually you're like, "Okay, we're going to go to Google. What's a Google? We'll get there. Don't worry. We go to Google. Okay, finally we're going to sign up here. You're going to get an email. Once you have an email, I don't know how to type. Great. Let me teach you how to type." And so the thing is is like the lower the skill level of the individual, the more aggregate skills they have to learn in order to chunk up. >> And so sometimes people hear the word, oh, you just need to do outreach. But that is a bundled term that has a hundred things underneath of it which is like how do I warm up a domain? How do I set you know what's an opener? how do I integrate my you know clavia with my whatever right like how do I integrate these tools and so there's a hundred how's underneath of it and they'll usually get stuck on one of the hows and being unwilling to try because it's so frustrating of like >> I think I think what makes entrepreneurship feel slow is that you can try to learn something for a day and not have an outcome and then have to come back to it tomorrow and figuring things out is by nature a wandering activity which means that if you knew how to figure it out then you wouldn't have to figure it out because you'd already know it. And so it's people do deal really poorly with uncertainty. And so entrepreneurship, a lot of it is just the the ability to tolerate uncertainty, which feels very painful the entire time you're in the uncertain period, which is what I honestly think a lot of the pain of entrepreneurship is wondering whether the investment you're currently making today, the thing you know you're going to lose, the money, the time, the effort, the sweat, is going to actually pay off to the thing that uh you hope is going to happen. And you don't know when it's going to happen. And so it's almost like if you run a marathon, you know, it ends at 26 miles or 0.2, I don't know, for you runners. Um, but like for entrepreneurship, it's just someone saying run. >> Yeah. >> And like, I'll tell you when to stop. And even if you like just that idea almost sounds torturous of like just run. It's like well how long? It's like run. >> It's like but what if my lungs start hurting? Run. >> Keep running. And I think that's what what makes a lot of entrepreneurship painful. And then the idea of even me saying this, some of you guys probably had your heart rates go up, right? Even the idea of not knowing when something is going to end or in other words when you're going to figure it out. A lot of people just don't want to start that race. >> And so they know what they're currently doing. And it's they get more rewarded for talking about scaling, for talking about their goals than they do for pursuing them, which involves a lot of uncertainty, f pain, and frustration. So this leads me to the next lesson where I want to talk about one of the most important mindset/skills that you need to train yourself on if you want to grow as a person and your business and at least that's what's helped for me and that's actually self-awareness. So I go deep on it right now. The hardest thing for people is judgment which is like how do I how do I know to listen to this guy versus that guy right? That's the hard part because you will see conflicting advice and if you were to ask two people who are both wealthy what someone should do. If you were to ask the Indian question what should someone focus on? English might not be the first answer from Richard Branson. I don't know. Maybe it is. Um, it also doesn't mean that his advice is wrong if it were different than mine, right? Maybe his advice is more right. No idea. Um, but I think understanding what is right for you given your existing resources and skills is probably the most valuable thing, which is self-awareness. And so I think I've always had a decent amount of self-awareness which has allowed me to make sure that I'm picking the products, services, information that I'm consuming the most of around whatever I believe the constraint to be. And then I would say that I'm relatively maniacal in the focus that I have around whatever the thing that's limiting me is. And so when I got into when I was like, "Okay, we're going to start this family office." I think I read 15 books in like two weeks on, you know, different family office structures, different investment thesis, um, books by people who ran big hold just so I could get some better idea of this stuff. And I would say 15 books is not like a huge amount of information, but it was like just to give an idea of like I did nothing else besides read. Um, and so if I thought that sales was the issue, I think people try to solve a problem one way. I tend to approach a problem with like I don't care which one works. I will do all of them violently and one of I will I will will my will this thing through. And so if like I needed to learn sales, I wouldn't be like, "Oh, I'll read a sales book." It's like, I'm going to read many sales books. I'm going to consume all videos on sales. I'll hire somebody who's good at sales to teach me and review my stuff in real time. And I will keep doing this until sales is no longer my problem and then I'll be like more which what's my next issue and then I'll just bomb the hell out of that thing. And I think people take too little action around what the constraint is. So either they haven't properly identified the constraint of their business or they take insufficient action to solve it or both. And I see commitment and focus as as very similar like kind of sister twins um which is just the elimination of alternatives. And so I think most people are not that committed. And so I think I it's really it really comes down to that. Like it's one of the one of the things that's really difficult to explain. And it like there's a few lessons like from a human nature perspective or from a skill-based perspective that are very difficult to see unless you're there. And consistency is one of them. So is volume. And they tend to be the two things that are most required in order to get to where you want to go. And so like you can't witness consistency unless you are also consistent in order to witness it. So like you can't see me come to the gym every day at 4:00 a.m. unless you were there every day at 4:00 a.m. And you can't see me work all day unless you were also here working all day. And I can say it and it takes 2 seconds. But when you witness it and you see it every single day, it has a different impact. And I think that's what what a lot of people miss out on. And like I talk about volume a lot and I repeat it so many times and I talk about focus so much because like those are the things that really separate the people who end up winning and the amount of volume that it takes is just so much more than you're prepared for. And I think if people really knew how much volume and repetition it took they wouldn't begin. And so I don't even think it's a bad thing that people don't understand because like if you really saw how far away the goalpost was you'd be like I'm not I can't do it because you can't do it. You couldn't even comprehend that because you're so far away from that type of person or that level of entrepreneur who'd be able to do it that it seems unfathomable, but you think it's a couple steps ahead of where you are and then you get a little bit of better and then you realize it's actually this much further. But then you get a little bit better and then you realize it's this much further and then eventually you start to realize like when you look back at how much you did in order to get there and then you're like, "Oh, that's why." Now, let's expand on the topic of distractions a bit more because if you were to boil down most of the business wisdom that's out there, it's probably just two thing, which is focus and patience. So, I want to share some tactical advice on how I personally stopped getting distracted by all the shiny objects and new ideas that I have because every entrepreneur has enough new ideas to kill their business. So, I want to provide some examples to drive that home and give you my thoughts on how I approach new ideas. I'll tell you a story. I was talking to a friend of mine. Um, he just inherited a billion dollars. His father was in private equity. he now manages their family office. And so I was talking to him about acquisition.com and school and some of the other things and he was like, "Yeah, man." He said, "Sometimes the most profitable thing you can do is wait." >> And so I think that um that might be the most profitable thing you can do. Like doing nothing is something. >> It's an action. I mean, [ __ ] I mean, how much willpower does it take to not start new things? >> A lot. >> A lot. >> Right. And so I think you should give yourself credit for like I you're banking goodwill with the business. >> Yeah. Um Jeff Basos had a a speech recently that he did in Italy. Some of you guys I shared a story of it for those you follow my Instagram. Um but he talked about his his rate of releasing the work. And so basically he said if I had 30 minutes I could write a 100 ideas on the whiteboard that would destroy my company. >> And so you have you you absolutely have enough ideas to kill your business. >> So what we want to do is prevent that from happening. And so um this is super tactical but for everybody because this is like really really really dramatically changed my trajectory as an entrepreneur. I have a lot of ideas, which is like I kind of scratch my itch of ideas because I get to idea about other people's businesses and then I go home and then Leila's like, "Do you want dinner?" And I'm like, "Yeah." But I forgot that we have a business, too. So, I wasn't allowed I didn't I didn't I didn't have a way to mess that one up, right? And so, and so and so what I do is I have I honestly have a document that's called Alex's big list of ideas. >> And every time I have an idea, I totally flush it out. I I put, you know, I put a link on the dock to another doc that has a big memo that has like, "This is how it work. this is what we'd make, this is how blah blah blah blah blah blah. And then I keep living my life and then when I finally see the team looks like they have smiles on their faces, like they're well-rested, they have a glint in their eye, then I pull back out my big list of ideas. And what's interesting is that like some of the ideas that I'm like, "This is going to be huge." I'm like, "That's why would I think that's a good idea?" Um because you get so emotionally charged and sold on the idea while you're in the process of the idea, in the throws of the idea, but when you get a little bit of space, you're like, "Oh my god, this is how other people would hear this idea." And I agree with them. I think it's a terrible idea. >> But every once in a while, um I'll give you an analogy from uh um the Sandra Bulock movie with the the offensive lineman. Remember that one? >> Blind side. So she said that I actually think about this a lot with ideas. She said if you like a shirt, she's like, you know, don't buy it, but if you go home and you're still thinking about it, you know, a week or two later, like you should probably go back and grab the grab the shirt or whatever, right? And so I think about that with ideas. Like if I'm able to like I have this fear, what if I forget the idea? If I forget the idea, it wasn't that good of an idea. But the ones that like keep you up at night, that keep gnawing at you, those are the ones that like I'll flesh out more and more and more, but I still have to release the work at a rate that the business can handle. And so then it gives you respect for the output capacity of the business. And then what ends up happening, which you real like you realize as you scale up, is that manpower is almost always the limiter >> is talent. Which is why you see the the billionaires on stage and they're like, "Guys, you just got to get a good team, you know, find good people and get out of their way. But the issue is that good people don't want to work for you, not you. Entrepreneurs in general. And so that's why like we have to go through this kind of bootstrap phase sometimes where we have to prove that we can earn the right to get true A-level talent because if you had the best AI person in the entire world, you could have a multi-billion dollar company within the next six months. The problem is that guy doesn't want to work for you. >> And so it's like who do I who do I need to become and what do I need to build in order to get that level of talent to come with me? And so we actually like a lot of in my opinion a lot of the entrepreneurial journey is creating the proof that then allows you to attract the talent that's required to build the next thing >> like the level of talent we were able to attract after we sold gym launch versus while we were scaling gym launch night and day not even close and so I see that as the trajectory and what also ends up happening is that you end up becoming like a collector of talent um and so the like and if you do write by people throughout the entire process what happens is the stars stay around and they come with you from thing to thing. And so all of a sudden the bench of stars just keeps getting bigger and and they don't want to work with other people because they're like, "We we have a great team. We have a great culture. We know how we do things here." And so in the beginning of your career, you have no stars. You're the only star. And then and maybe you're a half star, right? Um but eventually you'll get one other star and you're like, "Oh my god." But the reality is like if everyone thought like, "Man, if I only had 10 of these people, I could be 20 times bigger." You will get there. It's just it takes way more not stars that you thought were stars that you then have to fire and replace with another person that's also not a star to get another person to then replace with another person that's not a star. And I fundamentally believe that the reason that you can scale so much faster the second time or third time around. Who here has been uh who here this is not their first business. Can you get raise your hand real quick? Okay, cool. Keep your hands raised. Um if you if this is not your first business and this this business you scaled faster than the businesses you did before, keep your hand raised. Right? And like why why is that? It's not like the physics of business changed. It's just because your pattern recognition improves. And in order to get the pattern recognition, it's like you have to just get punched in the face a bunch of times with shitty people. And so like for me, like I know a vertical stack of what a a salesdriven org looks like up to a few hundred sales guys. Like I know what that stack looks like. I know what an SDR looks like. I know what an SDR manager looks like. I know what a closer looks like. I know what a closer manager looks like. I know what a a director of sales looks like. I know what a VP of sales look like and they have different archetypes and they have different skills and they have different behaviors. But if you've never done it, then you hire a VP of sales and he sucks and you hire another VP of sales and he sucks. You hire another VP of sales and she sucks and then all of a sudden one comes in and you're like >> you don't suck. >> This is amazing. And then from that point going forward, either that person comes with you or you know exactly how to pattern match and so you find the person really fast. And fundamentally every level of the business, it's kind of like bricks, right? like keep putting these level of bricks as you scale. The problem is that only one of those bricks prevents you and sometimes for years because you are lacking this hole and you don't know what it looks like when it's right. >> And that's one of the big issues. And so the goal is like how can I how can I be willing to have a hard conversation which means that I might like this person as a person but they're not doing their job. And how quickly can I can I can I close that gap so that I can replace them with somebody who's good. The hard part is that we don't like having hard conversations. >> Yeah. And so it's like I mean I do like the quote like the distance between where you are and where you want to be is the number of hard conversations you're willing to endure >> and a lot of people just aren't. So to ask answer the original question of like why don't people do what they want to do. A lot of them just can't have a hard conversation. Real quick check this out. So if you aren't sure what strategic competitive advantage you should be doubling down on. Um I'd love to invite you out to one of our scaling workshops uh that we have here in Vegas at our headquarters and my team can actually work with you on it. But before you do that, you can download our free $100 million scaling roadmap um where you can plug in your information and it will give you basically your step where you're at in the scaling process and ultimately give you the things that you can help get to the next level. But like I said, if you want help from my team, you can book a call after you download this. It's free and we'd love to uh see if we can help you out. This leads me to the next lesson. The person with the longest time horizon wins. Fundamentally, there's so much competition. some of the only alpha that's left over, meaning arbitrage of value, exists for people who are simply willing to wait and endure longer. So, let's expand on that. So, I think the person with the longest time horizon wins as long as that time rise isn't is is reverse engineered to some level of reality. So, I think Elon is the richest man in the world right now because he has wanted to build rockets, wanted to build cars, and wanted to go to space since he was like seven. And so, he has wanted to do this one thing his whole life. And he said it in his I don't know if you guys seen this like his Zip 2 like when he was like hadn't even sold his first company he was like I think cars are really cool like electric cars can you imagine and like rock like he's talking about this then like this has been what he's wanted to do his whole life. Um I would say for me I would say that my time horizon is not as long as Elon which is probably why I'm not as rich as Elon. Um but for me it's like I can probably see like call it 3 to five from now. Um, and I plan for that. And beyond that, I'm like, I don't know. I might be in a different person, different life, who knows? But that's kind of as far away as I can see. It's very difficult to have vision when you have bills to pay. >> And so, you have to get that situated first in my opinion. You have to get your like personal stuff figured out. And then you'll buy yourself breathing room to think further. >> Yeah. >> So, in that case then, am I thinking 3 to 5 years? No, I think you figure out how to like go to a million dollars a year and like don't worry about anything else. >> Say that again. I'm sorry. >> I think you think, how do I go from 100K to a million? That's my whole focus. And you can do that in a year. >> Yeah. Um >> and like when you do that, because the thing is is when you do that first level of going to like, you know, 100 to a million or 100 to 300, whatever the number is, right? You will have more resources and more skills. And so what happens is your vision of the board will change. You'll see the way the game's played differently. Mh. >> And so I see the people who are like the best at the game as the people who see reality the most clearly. >> And so if you've been doing something for a long time in your business and it hasn't been getting you what you want, it's usually because you don't see reality as clearly as clearly as you think you do. You see distortions. And so I think as people go up up wealth, it's because they actually are better at predicting what's going to happen, which is why they make more money than other people. And so that's why I see entrepreneurship as one of the best sources of personal development because you get slapped really quickly to find out whether you were right or wrong. So I want to quickly talk about AI. It's a hot topic. Some people are very excited. Some people are very scared. And some people think it's going to replace everyone and everything. And so I'm going to share my views on AI as the next portion of this TLDDR. AI is not going to change the fundamentals that make business business, but it will change the tools available to the players and sometimes in the future even the players themselves. There's opportunity more now than ever before because the leverage of the opportunity has increased. And so if we define leverage as the difference between what you put in and put what you put out, if you can get more out for what you put in, then you have higher leverage. And so with AI, this is where they'll be the first, you know, one person billion dollar companies, 10 person billion dollar companies, etc. And so people who have um more a more AI enhanced business, which the business that you're in does have more of those levers, then yeah, they will get more for what they put in. Eventually, if they're like, "Well, no one will do it because AI can do everything." Well, if you take AI to the natural extreme on an AI can do anything that a human can do, then you can say that about literally everything. And so, I don't think it's super productive. And so, I reverse it to what what will this knowledge change about my behavior. And so, my perspective or I take the position that since the dawn of time, it has been man plus tools against man plus tools. And right now we just have man plus better tools. And so nothing has really changed. Until the day it is man against machine and the machine wins. And so until we get to the day where we're going headtohead against machines, it's still the same game it's always been, just more fierce. So I want to shift gears here a bit and talk about one of the most important components which is sales and pricing. So there are a few concepts that I want to cover. The first concept is how I go about pricing a product. The fundamental principle I follow is either sell extremely expensive to a select few or something super cheap to everyone. The middle is where people die. And so fundamentally big picture, if you will sell something that is not scalable, then you want to sell with the absolute highest gross margins to the people who can afford that ticket, which makes sense to sell to people who have lots of money to get the money from them. On the other hand, there's tons and boatloads of people who have very little to no money. And so if you're going to serve those people, whatever char whatever price you charge, if it's even moderate, it's going to be a huge percentage of their income or their savings, which makes them very needy, very hard to serve. And so the only way to serve that customer is develop a product that is truly scalable, truly unlimited scale. And that is when you serve the people who have small ticket things. Let me give you more context on the thinking process. I prefer I think it's a higher you you maximize likelihood of you making more money if you are a service provider to go up market and sell to people who have more money and then eventually you can create a business that can retain customers um that has almost zero incremental cost of adding additional customer >> and then in that instance you absolutely can sell to the masses Amazon sells to the masses right there's not I'm not saying Amazon is a bad business it's exceptional business right um but they also had to raise $680 billion dollars of capital in order to build it. And so what happens is entrepreneurs who are under capitalized and underkilled think okay I'll just serve the masses with this thing but I don't have I don't have the capital and I don't have the skill in order to actually scale it. That's the issue. And so for the vast majority of quote unscalable businesses or less scalable businesses that require humans. That's where I prefer to say okay well if you're going to do the same work you might as well get paid 10 times as much. Great. Because there is an audience of people that would pay you 10 times more because they just don't know you exist. The reason the reason that it's so tough to service the bottom end of the market is that for them the small amount of money is a huge percentage of their income or their savings which means they're going to be ultra needy they're going to want so much more because they're putting so much in relative to them like it's like their entire life and so like you have to have like therapists on staff and like customer success people who are just like here to reassure somebody whereas if somebody's paying you know $100,000 they're making $10 million a year it's like it's 1% of their annual income like they really don't care that much and so I think finding customers whose problems you can solve and then the solution that you have for them matters so little like is so insignificant an amount of money that they will gladly pay you and so I try to think through that lens which is who has the problem the most acutely where the money I where the thing I'm charging is so insignificant that they don't care or at least it's reasonable right and you'll know that it's reasonable because you'll get lots of people to buy if people aren't buying or they're being really hard to convince it's because the value exchange isn't there it's probably overpriced and so I think thinking through the lens of the customer rather than like what do I need to survive which is I think how most entrepreneurs price. Next topic I want to shift to is I want to talk about retention. So fundamentally there are three types of retention. There's the percentage of customers, the percentage of cash, and then the percentage or the actual gross dollars retained. And so you can have high percentages but low absolute numbers which doesn't matter as much or you can have lower percentages but higher absolute numbers which is better. And so let me explain. So let's say you have 100 customers. Let's say you lose 20% per month. 20 of them cancel. You're left with 80 customers. But what if the 20 that cancelled were your highest paying customers and they represented 50% of your revenue? You just lost half your business but only 20% of customers. And so sometimes you got to look at like where are you losing from a gross dollar perspective and not just a customer count perspective. And so where possible I always try to look at like the actual dollars being retained not just the customer count. And then the last piece, which is I think the hardest one to track but in my opinion the most important is gross profit dollars retained. And so if you think about it, if I sign up a customer for $100 a month but my net churn after I pay for my my seats, my software, whatever, is $20, I'm only netting $20 from that. And so if I have another customer that I have that's $200 a month but I only make $10 in profit, even though the revenue is higher, the one that I'm making $20 on, even though it's half the revenue, is more valuable to me from a a pure profit perspective. And so where possible, I think understanding the unit economics to the level of what is my gross profit per account is super valuable because then you know which accounts to go after. So real quick, let me talk about outbound prospecting because I think this is probably the thing that most business owners are terrified of and that's actually having to reach out to people. And so this is my position on outbound. So people ask this a lot. They're like, "How much content should I make versus how much outbound should I do?" And so I'll say it simply. When you want customers now, you prospect. When you want customers later, you post. It really is that simple. And if you think about it from a supply demand curve, when demand is low, you make the supply more available and so you push. And so you're literally door to door. When demand is high, you make the supply more expensive or quote pull. You pull back the supply. So post. When you're trying to make something scarce, you post less. When you're trying to get people to come to you, you post more. But you prospect until you don't have to. And so I'm a huge believer that most businesses, like the thing that scares them the most is prospecting and that's probably the thing that will move the needle the most. But fundamentally, if you break it all the way down, sales is the number one skill. And so what happens is you learn how to sell and then you learn how to get people to sell to and so I see prospecting as an extension of sales, which is just getting people that you can sell to. And so fundamentally, can you help somebody make or save more money than whatever you're charging? If you can't, then you shouldn't reach out to them. If you can, it is your moral imperative to reach out. And I think most people are so afraid of rejection. Like I've rejected more people by not reaching out than anyone has ever rejected me because I can always say, "Well, I never reached out to that person and so I rejected them by default." And so I think most people's fear of rejection prevents them from doing the thing that would actually grow their business. So I'll just like layer on one last thing here and this is actually coming from like some questions I got. So the question was you know like when they were talking about doing cold calling they said "Well I don't want to interrupt people's days." So? Like who cares? And that's what I mean about like you have to be fundamentally okay knowing that like 99% of people will say no and you have to be okay with that. And the thing is if you can actually help them they will be grateful. And so fundamentally if you're worried about interrupting people it's because you don't believe that you can deliver value and so the only way to fix the fear is actually make your thing better and then you won't have a fear at all because you know you can help them. Um and so I think most people's fear of outreach is actually a symptom of a different problem which is that their thing isn't good enough yet. Okay, so hopefully that was helpful to understand my beliefs around prospecting and sales. Now let's talk about skills, hiring and people stuff. So a lot of you guys know like my content around hiring has gotten a lot of traction. I also think it's one of the most important things. And so I want to share how I think about people and talent. So I'll start with the first one which is this. Nobody owes you loyalty. You earn trust, prove your competence, and deliver results. People follow winners. And so the leaders who complain about loyalty are usually the ones who haven't earned it. And so you know I've never had a I've never had a huge problem with with turnover at our companies because I think we we build good cultures. But what I realized very quickly is that like if you lose people, you have to look at why you lost them and not blame them. And in particular, if you look at the best companies, if they lose people, they lose them up. And so what that means is if you're at McKinsey and you leave McKinsey, you probably went somewhere that you got a bigger opportunity or you went to a client or like you got to you know become a partner at another firm like you left up and that's actually good because McKinsey gets a reputation for having the best and brightest. Same thing with Goldman Sachs. Same thing with Amazon. And so a lot of people leave those companies to do other things but they're leaving to do bigger, better opportunities and that builds the brand of the original company because everyone knows that company trains the best people. And so if people leave my companies, I hope they leave to do something that's even more remarkable than what they were doing for me. That means I'm building a brand as someone who builds careers, not someone who just extracts from people. And so fundamentally I think you have to think about from their perspective like what are they getting out of this? Like what's in it for them? Like why would they stay? Like what are they learning? What skills are they developing? Like are they being compensated fairly? Are you treating them well? And so a lot of it comes down to and culture is one of the most important things there because you can have mission vision values on the wall but if you don't live it, they'll leave. And so I think a lot of times when people say like "Oh people have no loyalty" it's because you haven't earned it. And the second one on the hiring front um I think a lot of people they hire and they basically like they're in love with the resume and they hire the resume and they hire what they hope that person is and what usually happens is especially people who are less experienced at hiring, they will allow that person to onboard themselves. And so the person will be like "Oh yeah I got this" and they're like "Great I don't have to manage you" because they didn't want to manage them to begin with because that sounds like work. And so what happens is that person's like flailing around doing their own thing trying to figure out this new company and they make their job up and then 60 90 days later the founder is like "You're not doing your job." And they're like "What's my job?" And so I think being very clear on what this person is supposed to do in their first day, in their first week, in their first month, and the first three months is really important. And so I am a big fan of 90-day sprints or 90-day plans with new hires that are very clear on like these are the deliverables, this is what winning looks like in this role in the first 90 days. And that forces you as the founder or the hiring manager to actually articulate what you need done. Because a lot of times we just want to like offload responsibility to somebody and we hope they figure it out. And the reason they don't figure it out is because you never clarified what the expectation was. And so I'm a huge fan of making sure that every single person has very clear KPIs, very clear metrics, very clear scorecards so they know whether they're winning or losing on a daily basis, not just waiting for you to tell them at the end of the week or the end of the month. And then the last thing on culture that I'll say here is your culture is what you tolerate. And so if somebody is behaving in a way that you say is not like your values but you let them keep doing it, that's your culture. And so it's not about like what's on the wall. It's about what you allow. And so every single person in the company is looking to the leader to see what's acceptable and what's not. And so if you have a top performer who's a dick and you let them continue to be a dick to everybody, everyone knows that being a dick is more important than or being a top performer is more important than the culture value of treating people well. And so you have to be willing to let go of people even if they're high performers if they violate the values because otherwise you're just telling everybody that the values don't matter. And I've had to do that multiple times. And it sucks every single time. But what ends up happening is every single time I've done it, the team has rallied because they realize like "Oh you're serious about this." And they see that you're willing to make a hard decision for the betterment of the group and that builds trust more than any words ever could. So I want to shift gears here and I'm going to talk to you about media, content, and brand. So this is something that I get asked a lot about because I've gotten a lot of traction over the last couple of years on on YouTube, on social, etc. And so I'll just share my position on it and hopefully it's helpful for wherever you're at. So I'll start with I think there's a continuum of awareness. And so you have unaware, problem aware, solution aware, product aware, and most aware. And what content does is it moves people along the continuum. And so if I can make content that makes somebody problem aware or solution aware, by the time they get to the product aware stage where they're looking for a solution, I'm top of mind. And so the way that I think about content is not like I'm going to make a piece of content that's going to make me a million dollars. It's I'm going to make so much content that eventually when they are ready to buy, they only think of me. And so it's a long game. Like brand is always a long game. And I think the hardest thing for entrepreneurs to understand is delayed gratification. And they want to they want the return right now. And it's like you're building an asset that will pay you for the rest of your life but it takes a long time to build it. And so fundamentally the people who win at content are people who are willing to do it for a really long time before they get any return. And so I made content for years before I saw any material return on the investment. I just knew directionally I was like this seems right. Like I see other people doing it and it seems like it's working for them. So let me just keep doing it. And then eventually it hit a tipping point and then it worked and now I have an audience and now that audience you know refers people, buys from me, etc. But it took a long time to get there. And so I think a lot of people they try content for 60 days they're like "This didn't work" and it's like well yeah because you did it for 60 days. Like try it for 60 months and then see what happens. So that's how I think about brand and content. And I think the the thing that I would say from a tactical standpoint is consistency beats quality early on. And so it's better to make you know kind of mediocre content consistently than it is to make one perfect piece every six months. Because you just learn so much from doing the reps. And so I'm a big fan of just do the volume, get the reps in, and then you'll get better over time. And that's actually how you get good. You don't get good by waiting and then trying to make something perfect. You get good by making lots of stuff that sucks and then iterating. Okay so I'm going to shift gears one more time and I want to talk about the concept of leverage and Moats. And so I'll talk about leverage first. So leverage is how much you get out for what you put in. And so the ways to get leverage are you can use code and so that's software. You can use content and media. You can use capital. You can use other people's labor. And so those are kind of the the core ways to get leverage. And so when you're thinking about building a business, you want to think about like how can I get more leverage? And so if you are trading time for money one on one with no way to scale, you have no leverage. That's why a lot of service providers struggle because they max out at their own capacity. If you can record your knowledge one time and then sell it infinite times, you have infinite leverage. That's the beauty of information products. And so I think understanding the leverage available in your business model is really important. And then the second thing is creating a moat. And so a moat is something that makes you defensible. So what makes you hard to compete with? And in general there's a few different types of moats. There's brand, which is people just know you and they trust you so they buy from you even if there's other options. There's proprietary technology or IP, which means you have something that other people can't replicate easily. There's network effects, which means the more people that use your product, the more valuable it becomes. Think Facebook. The more people on Facebook, the more valuable Facebook is. That's a network effect. There's switching costs. So if it's really painful for somebody to leave your product, they're less likely to leave. Think Salesforce. Like if you have all your data in Salesforce and you've customized it, like you're probably not going to switch because it's such a pain. And then there's economies of scale, which means you can do it cheaper than anybody else because you're so big. Amazon can deliver stuff cheaper than anybody because they've built out the whole infrastructure. And so when you're building a business, you want to think about like what's my moat going to be? Like what makes me defensible? Because if you don't have a moat, then you're just going to compete on price, and competing on price is a race to the bottom, and that's not a game you want to play. And so I think understanding like what's my strategic competitive advantage, what's my moat, is one of the most important questions you can ask. And for a lot of you, especially if you're early, the moat is you. It's your personal brand. It's your reputation. It's the trust that you've built with people. And that's actually fine. That's a great place to start. And then over time you can build enterprise value on top of that where the business could run without you. But early on, being the brand, being the face, being the person people trust is actually a really good strategy. So I'll end with one of my favorite concepts which is volume. Okay this one I talk about all the time but I'll say it again because I think it's it's the thing that people miss the most. Jeff Bezos has this quote that I love where he said "We have a very high bar for talent but we expect people to get there through many failed experiments." And I love that because it's like you're going to try so many things and most of them won't work and that's expected. Like Amazon expects that you're going to try a bunch of stuff and it's not going to work. And so I think most people are not willing to fail enough to succeed. And so the the way I think about volume is like you have to just do so much more than you think is reasonable. And I and the analogy I use a lot is like imagine you go to a casino and you sit down at a blackjack table and you play one hand and you lose and then you leave and you're like "Gambling doesn't work." Everyone would think you're insane. But that's what people do with business. They try outbound for a week and they're like "Outbound doesn't work." Like no you didn't do enough volume. And so I think the the core thing is when you find a thing that theoretically should work, meaning like other people have done it and it's worked for them, the question is not does it work, the question is how much do I have to do in order for it to work for me? And the answer is always more than you want to do. Always. And so I think people dramatically underestimate the volume required. And so I'm a huge huge huge proponent of just doing an unreasonable amount of volume. Like when we were scaling gym launch I was doing 20 sales calls a day. That's unreasonable. Most people would say that's crazy. But that's what it took. And by doing that volume I got so good at sales that I could train other people. I could create scripts. I could create the whole infrastructure because I had done it so many times. And so I think do a totally unreasonable amount of volume on the thing that you think is going to work and then after you've done it 100 times then you can say it didn't work. But until you've done it 100 times you actually don't know. And so that's where the rule of 100 comes from which is like commit to doing something 100 times before you evaluate whether it worked or not. And I promise you by the time you get to 100 the vast majority of people will have seen material results because you just got so much better at the thing. And that's really what it comes down to. It's not about the tactic working. It's about you getting good enough at the tactic to make it work. All right so I'm going to summarize everything here. Number one, you're not disciplined if you only do things you like. Discipline is doing things you don't like. Number two, most people already know what to do but they don't do it, usually because of an inability to delay gratification or because they don't actually know how to do it at the detailed level. Number three, self-awareness is critical. You need to identify your constraint and then take massive action to solve it. Number four, focus and patience are everything. You have enough ideas to kill your business. Wait. Number five, the person with the longest time horizon wins as long as that time horizon is rooted in reality. Number six, AI is not going to change the fundamentals of business. It's still man plus tools versus man plus tools. Number seven, pricing. Either go super high end to a few people or super cheap to everyone. The middle is where you die. Number eight, retention matters. Track gross profit dollars retained, not just customer count. Number nine, you prospect when you want customers now. You post when you want customers later. Number ten, nobody owes you loyalty. You earn it. Number eleven, your culture is what you tolerate. Number twelve, content and brand are a long game. Consistency beats quality early on. Number thirteen, understand your leverage and build a moat. Number fourteen, volume. You have to do an unreasonable amount of volume. That is what separates people who win from people who don't. All right. So hopefully this was valuable.
