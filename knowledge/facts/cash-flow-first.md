# Cash Flow First Principle

> First payment must exceed CAC + COGS to scale without external capital.

## The Formula

```
First 30 days cash collection > (CAC + COGS for fulfillment period)
```

If this isn't true, you need external capital to grow.

## Example (from trash collection business)

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| CAC (customer acquisition cost) | $67 |
| COGS (3 months service @ $14/mo) | $42 |
| Sales commission | $50 |
| **Minimum needed upfront** | **$159** |

Old offer: $89 first payment → **cash flow negative**
New offer: $102 first payment → **cash flow positive (barely)**

## Why It Matters

- Enables scaling without investors or debt
- Each new customer funds acquisition of next customer
- Eliminates cash crunches during growth
- Allows aggressive customer acquisition

## How To Fix

If your math doesn't work:
1. Raise upfront payment (deposit, first + last, etc.)
2. Lower CAC (cheaper acquisition channels)
3. Lower COGS (efficiency, pricing power)
4. Restructure payment terms
