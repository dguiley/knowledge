I do think we are going to see the expedited attempt [music] to replace humans. Yeah. And at the corporate level too like that is one of the interesting things about AI as a technology is that normally technology replaces [music] what we might call blue collar work but this is going after white collar work. It'll be interesting to see if it works. [music] I mean, CLA and Dolingo, they were some of the first companies to let people go and be like, we're going to replace everybody with AI, but then they had to hire people back because it it doesn't always work that well. That's the other funny thing about [music] AI is it it uh needs quite a bit of nudging still. It's still new technology. >> Kyler, where does this podcast find you? >> Um, I'm actually in uh Florida right now. Marco Island. >> Marco Island? Wait, you have grandparents or parents who vacation in Florida? No. >> No. No. I'm here for the equipment leasing and finance conference. Yeah. No, my grandparents. >> I heard it's a crazy party. Is it Is it gotten out of control yet? The ELF party? >> Yeah. Michael Phelps is here today. So, um it's fun. Yeah. I spoke yesterday, so I'm leaving later today, but that is where you find me is uh Marco Island. Yeah. Thank you for being here. I we wanted to bring you on because you had a uh what was I thought a really interesting and provocative u piece in the New York Times arguing that the American economy is really uh Trump casino you said. Can you walk us through that thesis? >> Yeah, so that piece you know the economy has always been somewhat of a casino but underneath the Trump administration like there's a lot more room for gambling. like you could see tariffs as a gamble on the American economy that our allies will want to continue to work with us that the dollar will remain stable but then also in private markets you're seeing a lot of gamblingesque things too like private credit is looking a little bit shaky venture capital firms are funling funding funding uh like that roulette startups um and then of course you have the AI bubble that everybody is talking about right now so it just feels like everywhere you turn around from the government shutdown to the stock market like gambling has become the status quo. >> Do you think I'm trying to reverse engineer this to something very basic and that is I think a lot of I would imagine so I would argue the geopolitics is just an administration that's somewhat ignorant and hasn't done the game theory and overestimates their power at the poker table. they show up with cards that they they don't actually have. Um, and that's I would call that poor judgment. I'm not sure it's it's gambling. But at the same time, on the other end, what I see is a lot of young people who are constantly reminded every day that they're that they're failing because they don't have, you know, ripped abs or aren't on a Gulfream or didn't make 300% yesterday on some meme coin. and they believe that that is a normal part of the economy taking these sorts of crazy outsized risks and are engaging in it and they have access to this type of risk-taking in their pocket. As someone who is um younger, have you done any research or any thoughts about how this it strikes me this gambling economy seems to be especially prevalent among your generation? Your thoughts? Yeah, John Cohen wrote a great book that came out a few months ago about the rise of sports gambling. And so he did a lot of on the ground reporting with young people. Like one of his primary interviews was a early 20s person named Kyle who was living in Colorado who had had his life destroyed by gambling. And so you do see a lot of people go towards that path. Like one of the theories that I've been testing is that there's this idea is that young people have like zero risk tolerance or like all the risk tolerance. So you see, you know, Gen Z becoming the tool belt generation going back to the trades. I think that's primarily to reduce risk. Like when I talk to people who are going down that path, they're like, I don't think a college degree is going to pay off, so I'm just going to take this staple job at the factory. And then you see other young people who are going into meme coins. They're going into sports betting. they're, you know, vetting it all on companies that are doing AI things. And so it has become increasingly prevalent, I think, because we people are just grasping for straws to try and climb the economic ladder. >> You outlined three likely outcomes for this casino economy. The more probable one being that we see smaller crises unfolding as low growth persists through a series of disperate shocks. Do you see any kind of initial signs of the trouble uh that you're monitoring in this casino economy? >> I mean I lots of people are starting to talk about private credit. I I think that's a bit concerning like we're seeing some of the auto lenders start to go bankrupt. Uh first brandsolor JP Morgan lost I think $175 million on that company going under um Primal Lind. So you're starting to see some ruptures begin to happen in the private market where all of this risk was like taken on and there was like zero regulation which is always a recipe for disaster. So, I think we're starting to see that begin to show up and then I think we're starting to see young people begin to suffer from the consequences of the unfettered access to gambling um which you talk a lot about as well and so I I think we are starting to see some of these pain pockets begin to pop up for sure. >> What do you think of these predictions markets? Like what do you one is businesses and two is a reflection on our kind of society and economy. I mean, I think it is kind of like gamble on everything. It's uh I don't know. Like, I think the idea makes sense and like if you're trying to find consensus for information, uh I think that makes sense and like sure, but I think what they incentivize is people finding some sort of way to gamble on everything. Like one of the comments underneath my New York Times article on Twitter was like, "How can I bet on how many views this article is going to get?" And so I think everybody is just seeing the world through the lens of gambling which is not a very stable or well structured society. And when I say everybody obviously like I'm you know being dramatic. It's not everybody but it is a lot of people. Um because again it seems like the one way to make money is to bet on everything and and that's concerning. Do you think some of it, and again I'm this is this really is a a question looking for illumination and and and potentially push back, but I wonder if some of it is we've kind of our our role models for a younger generation when I think about the president is always going to be a role model whether we want him to be or not and the wealthiest person in the world in a capitalist society. In both of these individuals, it feels like they're sort of conflating or creating an image where you can easily conflate masculinity and leadership with being incredibly aggressive and incredibly risk aggressive. Like doing things that have never been done before, saying things that have never been done before, shooting a rocket into space that scissors can capture. I mean, there's a positive side to this risk aggression, but it feels as if our leaders are no longer measured in any way that they're taking these outsiz risks and that sort of is that potentially what's going on here that our role models are just more risk aggressive on, you know, any angle. >> I think a little bit and like not all risk is bad. Like in order to grow an economy, you know, you have to be able to catch a spaceship inside of scissors. you have to take on some element of risk. But I think like the risk that is being encouraged now like when you look at the president just objectively like the guy bankrupted because he knows like he took on a ton of risk and and what you know that wasn't always successful but he had like some form of a safety net to catch him whereas a lot of people are taking on risk now are doing it because they have no safety net. And so I think people are looking at the billionaires, maybe soon to be trillionaires, and saying like, okay, they took these big leaps, like they figured it out. Like hopefully I can do that too. Um, but the path is not always that clear and it's not that stable and that those people had a lot of help along the way. But I do think it encourages uh behavior that might not be conducive to cohesiveness. Like when we think about Twitter and you know even just like quote unquote taking a risk on saying something uh polarizing on Twitter like a lot of people are monetizing their accounts that way. Um so yeah that sort of gambling mindset applies to both money and to communication. >> So we now have 10 companies responsible or make up 40% of the S&amp;P. The S&amp;P is 50% of global market cap. So 10 companies are now arguably 20% of the world's value at least in the public markets. That to me feels like a concentration of risk that typically we didn't like to have or tolerate. What are your thoughts on the concentration of of value across a small number of companies? >> Yeah, I don't think it's great because also it's you know 40% of GDP growth is coming from the AI companies and the 20% of companies that you reference are like primarily dabbling in AI. It's the big tech companies. Um, and uh, you know, there's 75% of S&amp;P 500 earnings growth. And so like our whole economy is becoming this like really big risky bet on AI, but when you think about, you know, the jobs that we're adding, they're primarily in healthcare and social services, at least the last time that we got data from the government. And so like these companies are taking on more and more value. They're growing bigger and bigger, but they're maybe not adding to the economy in a way that we would expect outside of building data centers. Like data centers don't add that many jobs. So you don't need that many people building them. Um like what the US needs is jobs. And so I I worry about that. Like I think I do worry about the concentration risk especially when we think about 401ks and people who are going to try to retire soon. Like all of the onus of their retirement is on them and therefore it's on the S&amp;P 500 continuing to succeed. And then I also worry about these companies really just sucking the life out of the market and then um not not contributing to the economy in a way of a growing labor market. >> Yeah. I parrot a comment you made that just sort of summarized um the economy right now. You said America is essentially a giant bet on AI and I thought that was just such a a kind of cogent distillation of what's going on right now. What do you I mean my sense of history is the stuff you're expecting to go right often times doesn't and the stuff you're expecting to go wrong often times doesn't. like upticks in the market are from areas we weren't expecting and uh crises you know 9/11 and co very few people were predicting those things. What do you if you were if someone said to you at your conference Kylo do you think it's a good time or a bad time to invest in this AI economy? What are your thoughts? I mean what I've been telling people and obviously like it's not investment advice but I still think it's important to have some exposure to the companies um not all exposure like that's kind of one of the issues with younger investors is like 70% of their portfolio will be in tech companies which is like you know decent rule of thumb but with the concentration risk I think it's it's pretty dangerous and so a lot of investment advisors will advise you to diversify across gold across utility companies um across like things that are a little bit more stable uh you know across international companies too. So not having your whole whole portfolio just exposed domestic. So I I think that's like one way to navigate the uncertainty and you know the potential bubble popping uh that we might have. So that's that's been a good rule of thumb. >> What does Kyla Scanland do with with her money? How do you invest? What's your approach to investing? Yeah, Kyla Scandlin does what I just said. So, yeah, that's what I do. >> Index funds or >> Yeah. Yeah, primarily. And then I, you know, I've been taking advantage of high yield savings accounts as well. Um, you know, the Fed is probably going to cut rates, so that's going to get less and less exciting. Um, but when rates were high, that was pretty cool. Um, but yeah, no, I'm I'm pretty exposed across uh ETFs. I'm a very boring, very plain, vanilla investor. I, [snorts] you know, put aside 20 bucks a month toward the S&amp;P and then I've been investing more and more in gold with the recent runup in gold that's been a bit like, oh, this feels a little little dangerous, too, which is crazy that like people are looking at gold as something that's too risky to invest in. Um, I have some exposure to crypto as well. So, I just try to like have a a diversification as uh one of the only free lunches in investing as they say. So, I try to take advantage of that. Yeah. >> And do you buy the thesis that the surge in gold and the increase in crypto over the last couple years is essentially the debasement of the dollar and trust in America? >> Uh I mean that's you know that's an interesting topic that a lot of people have gone back and forth on. I mean crypto is a levered NASDAQ so I don't think you can really say that about crypto. It's been unfortunate to watch that industry lose itself. And I I used to work in crypto and thought it could be something really cool and I I just think it's become also a part of the gambling economy. But with regards to gold, like I think the interesting thing there is that China is really trying to become the place where people park their gold reserves to kind of, you know, navigate around the US dollar. Um saying like, "Hey everybody, like invest in gold and then invest that gold with us." And I think that might work in some regards because I do think people might be trying to find some alternative to the dollar. I think that's going to take a long time if that does eventually happen. Um, but I think there's some element of truth and people trying to not have as much exposure to the US. Yeah. >> You said a couple things I want you to unpack there. Uh, that crypto has levered NASDAQ. What do you mean by that? And then secondly, you said you were in crypto but you think the industry has lost itself. Say more about that. Yeah, I mean I'm not the first person to call crypto levered NASDAQ. It's essentially like the way that tech stocks move. Crypto will move like three times bigger. Um so if tech has a big selloff then crypto will have a gigantic sell-off. Um if tech moves up, crypto will move up. It's interesting because uh you know now JP Morgan is allowing institutional clients to use Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral. Uh so there is like that institutional backing to crypto but that also means it tends to trade a bit like tech stocks because institutions have sort of um flattened it and like flattened the moves. So I I just think it's like not any different than tech which is probably a very unpopular opinion but to the point that I used to work in crypto. Um yeah I used to work with uh several crypto companies and and thought it was really great. A lot of my very early writing was about crypto and kind of about what it would look like to have the future of finance, like what decentralized finance could look like. Um, you know, what it could look like to sort of build this online world that was uh had its own form of money. And yeah, I mean, when you even think about Bitcoin, like the original proposal was a payments to pay like a persontoerson payment system, and I don't think it really can be that just because it's so speculative. So, it's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just I don't know if crypto knows what it what it is. It's definitely not a currency. It's just an asset. >> And you feel as if it's sort of lost itself or it sounds like your tone was you you soured a little bit on the industry. Why? >> This is just one of the things that happens when people get really really really rich is they forget what they're doing something for. And I think a lot of people in crypto, you know, saw tremendous wealth. And I I think you can kind of lose the plot when all of that money comes pouring in and you might forget the mission of what you're originally doing. I think Ethereum has kept to the plot pretty closely. Like uh Vitalic, one of the founders seems pretty focused on like what he wants that thing to be. Um but that's not, you know, that's not the whole industry. Support for this show comes from Adobe Express.

What do what do you think are the biggest stories unfolding that get the least amount of coverage relative to the impact they might have? What are we not talking about that we should be talking about? Everyone's I feel like we're on to kind of the AI bubble. There's a lot of there's a lot of media around that and which makes me think I feel like when any everything's something's overcovered it's either it's either going to continue this reminds me of 1997 and that is everyone had consensus we were in an internet bubble and the NASDAQ went up another 100%. It's when everyone decides we're in a new model and it's different this time and maybe all rules, you know, all bets or the rules have been broken. That's when you need to watch out. So I I feel like the AI quoteunquote bubble has been covered. >> So you think we're in 1997 right now relative to the AI bubble? >> The good news is when you're my age, you have some historical perspective. The bad news is you have historical perspective. And that is you want to make your life easier with pattern recognition. And the reality is most of these patterns are, you know, they history does repeat itself. Well, what is it? It doesn't it it, you know, it rhymes. It doesn't repeat. And when I look at all of this and the analog is the dot boom, I see a lot of similarities. These circular deals really worry me. You know, Nvidia investing hundred billion dollars in a company with the agreement they're going to buy their chips and that is accretive in the short run, but setting up kind of a house of cards in terms of, you know, capital structure, capital formation. I see euphoria. But at the same time, it's different this time in the sense that these companies their earnings growth hasn't matched their PE expansion, but it's it's pretty strong. These are real companies with real cash flows. But where I was what I was referring to is that the economist called the dot bomb implosion perfectly. They said how it would start, why it would happen, the damage it would do. Problem is they called it in 1997. And from that point, if you'd stayed in internet stocks, you would have made a ton of money. Now granted you would have given it all back but I don't you know what I have come to believe is that when everyone when all economists agree on something you should go the other way and it feels like all economists at least right now are saying AI is you know somewhat overvalued and which lends me to believe that okay it's probably going to run further. I mean, every instinct in my body is saying sell all stocks right now. But but but typically when I have that emotion, a lot of people are having that emotion and it's not the thing to do. But so yeah, I see echoes of it. But the reality is I don't trust I don't trust my gut on this stuff a lot because I try to be emotionalist and do what you're doing and that is just be diversified and not try to time the market and not try and convince yourself you're smarter than the market. But are there things out there that you know it's it's it's the iceberg you don't see that takes the ship down. Are there things you see you see that people that we're not talking about? >> I mean I yeah I agree with you that everybody's talking about the AI bubble and how bad it could be if it all explodes because it is such a big part of the economy. You know 40% of GDP growth is is no joke. But I I think like a lot of people are talking about it, but the government shutdown I feel like has not like we're kind of like, oh no, it's still shut down and we're it's like about to be the second I think it is the second longest shutdown ever. Um and you know a bunch of people 40 million people are about to lose access to food stamps. Um and I I just think like there's such a clear distinction and I'm curious if it was the same way in the 1990s. there's such a clear distinction and divergence between the stock market and the economy. So like with the government shutdown like that's severely affecting the economy but you have this huge runup in stocks and I think a lot of people are kind of covering that idea but when we talk about the AI bubble I don't think we necessarily talk about that idea. It's more like oh novidia gave open AI 100 million billion zillion dollars. So was it like that in the 1990s too like that did you feel that divergence between the two? It's a really thoughtful question. You know, in the 90s, I was I was building internet companies and not that thoughtful or I didn't have much situational awareness beyond the e-commerce company I was running, trying to raise money for, and trying to hire people. I didn't think a lot about big picture societal issues. Also, we just didn't have the concentration of wealth. We didn't have it felt like a more gentle time. You know, it was Oh, who was it? It was a It was George Bush who looked soft and cuddly back then. Although progressives thought he was evil incarnate, now we look back and think, "God, he was so adorable and so nice and there wasn't nearly the polarization." And also, we didn't have we were blessed with a lack of social media showing I mean, social media has figured out that I'm a progressive and that every video they show me of an of a mass person from ICE separating a woman from her husband knows I'm going to be so enraged that I'm not going to be able to look away from the phone. And so, I don't know how much, you know, there's an interesting statement, another statement I love is that we're not that divided, but we have the most powerful companies in the world trying to divide us. So it is different. I don't envy people of your generation whose media consumption is so anxietyridden, is so trying to tune you up uh to enrage you such that you'll be engaged. Um have you thought about I mean well one where does someone like you get the majority of your information? What is your media diet? And have you found and and this is more of a question around, you know, the psychological impact, but have you found that it takes a toll on you and people your age? I I I'm and I don't I can't figure out if it's I'm just getting older and angry or more depressed, but I literally have to have self-imposed blackouts from the media now because I find the algorithms are purposely trying to take me down really really ugly rabbit holes. Anyways, your media died and thoughts on the impact on your generation? Yeah, I mean my media dot is I I read a lot of the you know major news publications. So New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg. Um I also love like the other magazines like N plus1, Phenomenal World. So I read a lot. Um but I also use Twitter a lot and it's been or X. So, and and that's been like the biggest bummer in the world is that used to be such a place for economists and finance people to really get together and like talk about ideas. Like it used to be, you know, this this place to really connect and even back in 2021 and and now it's it's not. It's like so polarized and the algorithm is being tweaked to totally fry everybody. And so I definitely see that with a lot of young people. Um, and I have an account that I've tuned to be quite conser conservative. So the this is like a b like a burner account that I don't post or anything, but I just view that account to make sure I'm not missing anything because my feed is also, you know, pretty attuned to what what Democrats are up to or or the center left or center right. Um, and yeah, this account is is very MAGA oriented and it's wild. Like the amount of rage bait that that account gets served. Um, and it's it's pretty concerning. And so I also have to make sure that I don't fall down a rabbit hole because one thing that's really tough about these big companies is that they weaponize empathy, right? And so a lot of people are pretty good-hearted and they just want to help and they just want to make sure everybody's doing okay. And that's when you can get in trouble is because you watch these videos or you read these things like trying to understand, trying to figure out how you can help and that's really when it becomes dangerous. Um because you you know I think a lot of people care so much that they they go a little bit crazy and so I have to really watch myself with that kind of stuff. Yeah, as I think it sounds like you do too. You mentioned the the fissure, the growing disparity between kind of the Wall Street economy and the real economy and what do you what we've said on the show that >> [snorts] >> uh that the Dow Jones and the NASDAQ have been just incredibly damaging metrics because they give people the illusion that things are okay often times when they're not. and as long as the NASDAQ goes up or my thesis is as long as the NASDAQ keeps going up, the president can send troops into American cities and get away with it. Uh curious to get your thoughts on these metrics and also what metrics you look at that you think are better indicators of the health of quote unquote the real economy. >> Yeah, I I wrote this piece on my newsletter a few weeks ago called AI is the stock market and the stock market is the government. is sort of that idea where the government or yeah the government has a lot of latitude if the stock market continues to go up like if the market was selling off right now he would not be allowed to send troops onto the street I think Congress would have a lot more pressure to reopen the government and because so because the stock market is so disconnected from any sense of reality we're actually in I think deeper trouble than we should be and it's it's uh yeah it's like wild to watch this stuff where it's like, oh, AI earnings are going to continue to go up. Like, stock market's going to go up forever. It's just so bizarre to me. And even, you know, we got this inflation data the other day, even though the government shut down, they brought back a small team of the BLS because we needed to readjust social security payments according to inflation. and the stock market rallied on the idea that inflation was somewhat going down. Even though it's still 3% year-over-year, that the Federal Reserve is going to cut rates. It was like, woohoo, everything's going well. Even though like people can't find jobs, inflation is still very high and the Fed is cutting into that. Um, and so yeah, I think like the metrics that I try to pay attention to, it's a lot of anecdotes right now. um because we don't have of have data and I I know that's always that's a bit dangerous. But I you know I post videos about the economy almost every day on social media and a lot of people message me and tell me what they're feeling and what they're paying attention to and what they're worried about. And so I kind of absorb all of that and and try to get a better sense. But then in terms of like real data, the Chicago Fed has some real time labor market indicators that are pretty pretty useful. It pulls from public and and private data. And so I found that to be helpful. There isn't an inflation metric that I've found to be super uh good outside of the numbers that we get from from BLS. Um so I'm still trying to piece that together. And uh yeah, and then I think another interesting thing is when we think about the stock market, it's important to look at the number of companies that are booming that have no revenue. So, a lot of the boom in the stock market right now is being led by these companies that don't have a lot of profits. You know, they have essentially no revenue. And I think that's a good indicator for the actual underlying health of the stock market and the fact that it's not being led by fundamentals. And it tells a different story than like the Dow Jones going up. It's like what why is the Dow Jones going up? It's because these companies that aren't making money are going up because people are gambling on them. the administration trying to interfere with the Fed, what feels like social socialism or government intervention or attempted influence on private private markets, picking companies they invest in or want to get golden share in US deal tariffs, which is when I was in graduate school and I was a graduate student instructor in macro and microeconomics. It was just a case study and look at how stupid we were at one point in history with tariffs. Are I'm surprised. I'm curious if you're surprised. Are you surprised the economy is as strong or not as bad? I I would have thought the economy would not be holding up the way it is right now. What are your thoughts? >> You thought it would have imploded because of the tariffs or just because of everything else going on? >> All of it. Uh fear around fear around lack of independence of the Fed, tariffs, uh a move towards a cross between socialism and cronyism. I I just think all of these things to me the market would have had a stronger gag reflex and the numbers to be fair a lot of the underlying numbers are concerning but a lot of them are are stronger than I think people were expecting right I don't the inflation number is not good but it's not terrible and and job yeah we've had some job loss loss but there has been you know there's the AI boom I keep reading about this quotequote reindustrialism ation of America. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but I keep reading about it. I don't know how much of it is just propaganda, but are you what are your current thoughts on the state of the economy versus your expectations? And if you're comfortable talking about what you think might unfold in say 26. >> Yeah, I mean to the point of the re-industrialization of the economy, Iowa, a state that is very reliant on manufacturing, is like essentially in a recession. So there's a really interesting map and I cannot remember who made the map but it showed the number of US states that were in some type of economic contraction and it was over half of them I believe. And so I think when we like zoom in on these individual cases like states that were really reliant on manufacturing actually working out um you see a lot of uh a lot of that not happening. Like one of the things that Trump did promise was that he would bring manufacturing back to the US. And the way that he's doing that is through tariffs. Um which is not that intuitive, right? Ideally, you would use a carrot instead of a stick method in order to to bring people back. And it takes a long time to rebuild manufacturing. And so you do see these these pockets of pain for these um places that overwhelmingly did vote for Trump. And the longer the government stays shut down, like a lot of these red states that voted for Trump, they're heavily reliant on the social safety net. Like they're reliant on food stamps. They're reliant on Medicaid, the thing that is being the the reason the government is shut down, right? Healthcare. Um, and yeah, I think it's going to get more and more painful uh because people need those things. People need an economy that works outside of AI. Um, like they need jobs that are more than just data center. Um and the argument there is that like the economy has always gone through some turmoil with technology. Uh like nails used to be 0.5% of GDP like hammer and nails uh back in the 1800s. And so like there's always some shift. But I think like this this and I'm curious what you think about this like the combination that we have right now of political turmoil and technological turmoil is like quite pronounced and it seems the way that politics are unfolding just objectively as you said is like pretty destructive just net on net like it it's harmful and I think the market is ignoring that because of the AI stuff. It's like, okay, who cares if like the economy implodes outside of AI as long as AI succeeds because it'll take over everything. And so I think that's the divergence, but like this transitional time if it does end up working is really painful. But like how do you sort of see that combination of politics and technology like do you think they're feeding off of each other in a harmful way or protecting the economy? >> Well, I would bifroate them. I I don't think you can get in the way of innovation and that is AI is going to replace a lot of jobs. I actually think automation and GLP1 are perhaps even more impactful technologies than you know I just wrote a post saying I think GLP1 is more impactful on the real economy than G than GPT5. I just think people reducing their the fat economy or the diabetes industrial complex is just enormous right now. And if people, you know, if GLP1 were to permeate the households, like I think it's possible, I think that's going to have a bigger impact on people's lives. And quote what we we were talking about before the real economy with Trump. I just don't get these policies. I I'm trying to figure out it's as if I wanted to elegantly really screw the economy for the mid and the long term and reduce our prosperity inch by inch every day. I think this is a genius playbook. tariffs, cronyism, lack of respect for rule of law. Um, we're going to place tariffs on people. Young people feel bad because they can't buy a home. So, what are we going to do? We're going to tariff drywall gypson from Mexico and lumber from Canada and make building houses more expensive. I I just don't It's as if they look at every pain point and say, "How can we rub salt in the wound of this pain?" So I don't I have a difficult time understanding any of the rational or logic behind this or that there isn't quite frankly more sort of small revolutions um in our society. The what I would you said something there that I thought was really powerful and I want to pose on and that is America needs an economy outside of AI. I think that's really powerful and what you were saying before about data centers not having that not needing that many people to build them. They need even less people to operate them. They don't even need to turn the lights on during the day. There's just no one no one's needed there. The the story I'd love to get your feedback on that I think is the really big story right now is Amazon I don't know if you saw this. Amazon just announced they're laying off 30,000 corporate jobs. And I got to think when they announce it they're going to there was this seminal earnings quarter that I can't get over or call about three quarters ago. It was Meta saying they'd increase their revenues 23%. While decreasing headcount by 20%. I don't think any company's ever done that because generally the way it works is if you're growing, you tell your head of HR to hire more people. And I've said that AI is corporate ompic and that it's turn the switch off among CEOs that they need to eat more or hire more to grow. And I think Amazon is about to have one of those quarters where it announces great earnings or great revenue growth with a huge destruction or decrease in cost i.e. people being laid off and the stock their stock is going to surge their stock and their earnings are going to surge that we're about to see this arbitrage of human capital arbed into greater earnings and a surge in some of these information intensive companies. cuz I think it's coming at Goldman, JP Morgan, all of those companies. Anyways, your thoughts on Amazon and this kind of labor destruction or or the announcement they're laying off 30,000 people at corporate. >> Yeah, it's UPS is doing the same thing. Like I think they announced that they were going to cut 20,000 jobs and I don't know if it's at the corporate level, but they actually ended up cut cutting 34,000 instead. So even more. Um yeah and then Target I think is cutting a thousand jobs. GM is cutting a couple hundred jobs. So I think we are going to see more and more of that. And to the point of the investment banks like all of the AI companies are launching their AI excel like Claude Anthropics model just announced that. I think Perplexity has something like that too. Um I believe that one of the AI labs has employed former investment bankers to actually train an investment banking version of AI. And so I do think we are going to see the expedited attempt to replace humans. Yeah. And at the corporate level too like that is one of the interesting things about AI as a technology is that normally technology replaces what we might call blue collar work but this is going after white collar work. It'll be interesting to see if it works. I mean CLA and Dolingo they were some of the first companies to let people go and be like we're going to replace everybody with AI but then they had to hire people back because it it doesn't always work that well. That's the other funny thing about AI is it it uh needs quite a bit of nudging still. It's still new technology, but um so yeah, I think that's going to be very strange. And with that portion of the workforce being displaced, it'll be interesting to see how they respond politically. You know, what they start asking for, what they want. Right now, we have like zero regulation on AI. And so I think if this if all the big companies start cutting their corporate workforce, we could sort of see a lot more uh groups begin to coales around the idea that there has to be some sort of human AI partnership rather than companies just gutting people and and giving jobs to technology.

[music] We have our own problems. I mean, the stock market, the NASDAQ and the Dow Jones are doing really well, touching new highs, but it definitely feels like there's a lot of political division. People are more anxious. You know, it doesn't feel like the US is a role model for the rest of the world. But I have I struggle to point to another economy that's doing better. Do you when do you spend any time thinking about China or the European economy who is doing well or or also just a a followup I'd just love to know any thoughts you have about the ch the state of the Chinese economy right now. >> China is really interesting like China uh you've have you heard of Breakneck Dan Wing's new book? >> Uh yes I have. Yeah, I mean he kind of captures it pretty well. Like you uh China has like an engineer economy. The US has a lawyer economy. A lot of people have said that about other economies in the past. Like the US has always been this this sort of lawyerly economy relative to everybody else being an engineered economy. Um, and I think that's pretty true is that it feels like the US is having all of this infighting and then China is over there like developing bullet trains or I believe um they just found like a cure for baldness or something like that. And so it seems like they're able to like really capture technology and use it in a way that the US isn't. But like they have their own problems like they are also staring down a demographic crisis, right? and they also have the laugh flat problem where a lot of their young people don't necessarily want to work. Um, and so I think that's an economy that's really complicated and it works really well because it's a command economy. Um, the US is is not and therefore it tends to flounder. I think what's disappointing with the US right now is that we just have a bunch of money going into like the dumbest things possible and that's pretty frustrating relative to China. Like China also just announced that the people who post information about certain um sectors on tech on social media have to have like degrees in the subjects that they're talking about on social media or else they get fined. And I think that could be really useful um in terms of the polarization on the division that we see in the states is people actually being educated on the topics that they talk about. Uh and so yeah, I mean I think Europe is like a different case. they've just been struggling for a really long time to find their footing to grow. Um they also are suffering underneath the demographic crisis. Like I think that's the thing that everybody's going to have to grapple with over the next couple of years is we have a rapidly aging population. The economy is going to have to change to accommodate that. All of these economies and economies rely on an influx of young people to continue to grow as you've talked about. And I just I I don't know how we're going to fix that. Like that's the number one thing. That's the number one thing I worry about is is demographics. And both China and the US are are suffering from that. >> Specifically, the ratio of young to old is headed in the wrong direction. Do you think we can solve that with immigration? >> That's one way to solve it. It's, you know, immigration or or having more babies. Uh having more babies is hard to incentivize. You know, South Korea tried to pay people $1,000 and that didn't really work either. So immigration, high-skilled immigration is is one way the economic innovation group had has a good paper on highskilled immigration and like how much it does add to the economy. Like it is a boom, you know, paying taxes, adding to the local community. Um, but yeah, the politics gets in the way with that. >> Well, I want to pivot and talk a little bit about kind of Scanland, Inc. And that is I think a lot of young we have a lot of young people listen to pod and I think they probably have seen the ascent of your career and your relevance in the last 24 months and I think that is really cool like how did she do that? So any any tips for like what platforms have been you know breakthrough for you? What's worked? What hasn't? If someone thinks I would like to be the Kylo Scanland of art or of of fashion or of you know of engineering in Europe, whatever it is, I want to be a domain expert. I want to have relevance. I want to be invited to conferences in Florida. Like what what has worked and what hasn't worked is you've developed this you're essentially an entrepreneur. I mean it's my understanding is it's just just you or maybe maybe not. That's just me. It's just me. Yeah. >> And you put out that's extraordinary. The amount of content and the relevance you have as a sole proprietor is really extraordinary. Anyways, what advice would you have given yourself, your younger self three or five years ago in terms of where you would have invested more and where you would have invested less. >> So I I guess like very quickly the way I got started was it was during the pandemic. So I had moved from Kentucky where I'm from to Los Angeles to work at Capital Group. So byside firm um you know had majored in econ finance and data analytics and just really loved teaching and like wanted to get a PhD but my professor told me to go corporate first and I was like that sounds great. Uh, six months into that job, the pandemic hit and I was all alone in this 350 foot apartment in Los Angeles. Had no friends. And so I started making videos. Um, and the videos were weird. Uh, you know, they were skits where I was pretending to be Jerome Pal, which I don't know if anybody has, uh, ever done uh, besides me. And I just I just really wanted people to understand the economy. And so I think like that is always my biggest piece of advice is like do it in the way that feels very authentic to you. And so for me it was like these really bizarre strange skits where people are like oh I didn't know like you could have fun and talk about economics at the same time which is what I was trying to do. And I just had a a big I still have a big passion for educating about the economy. I think it's a total disservice that we do to the public, sending them out into the world and and not teaching them things. And so I started my company officially four years ago now. So I've been doing this for what feels like a long time, but really isn't even that long. And I just think it was consistency. Like I've posted almost every day um since. Uh and I've written, you know, hundreds and hundreds of articles. I wrote a whole book. So consistency, staying authentic to what you truly care about and messaging it in a way that feels relevant to you. Um, and yeah, not letting the fear of being perceived get to you. Like I'm an introvert. It's funny like my friends from when I was growing up or think it's so weird that I have this like public lifestyle cuz I I I do prefer to research. And so I think that's the biggest thing is like there is a whole big world out there and there's people who want to see what you want to message. You just have to do it in a way that feels good for you. >> But if you last question, if you look at all of the distribution channels and platforms, whether it's YouTube or Tik Tok or Substack or your newsletter or books, I stack rank the things that have worked the best for you. If you were to say to someone, all right, you have a limited amount of human capital. This is what So, we started doing 15 years ago, me and my business partner, my old firm, L2, started doing these videos called winners and losers on YouTube. And it was just breakthrough for us. No one knew who I was. No one who knew who L2 was. People thought they were funny. Sounds a little bit like what you did with mimicking Jerome Powell. So, YouTube was seinal for us 10 or 15 years ago. What has been what platform or medium has has really worked for you? >> Pointing is it was Twitter because that's where all the finance and econ people went to go hang out. It's not that anymore. Don't post. Don't I mean still post on Twitter but be careful. Um it's it's really become bad. Uh Instagram reels like the discoverability on there. I know you know we kind of talk down on Mark Zuckerberg sometimes but the platform is still pretty good for discoverability. Uh YouTube is still Yeah, it's still I mean you have to like you got to that's the thing is you got to keep from the It's the worst. It's the worst. But um it's a tool. It's a tool at the end of the day. Social media is a tool. If you can interrupt somebody's scroll with like really good information as you do about like markets, economy, culture, like that is worth it to go and use these platforms for what they provide. But Instagram reels, a lot of people have substacks now. I was had like one of the first substacks I think and and that was really cool like a decentralized newsletter. Um YouTube is still really powerful. Uh podcasts are really powerful like uh that's I think a really good tool. But yeah, uh Tik Tok maybe not so much right now, but it it's still the main platforms and kind of being in many places at once. So I think they're all equal in that regard is you want to have as many touchston as you can with people because they're all on different platforms. Um, but it's it's sort of >> it is a cumulative effect, isn't it? It >> Yeah. >> sort of a flywheel. >> Yeah, it is. Social media captures us all that way, right? >> Scary. Kyla Scandlin is an economic commentator, educator, and founder of Bread, a financial education platform reaching millions through storytelling and analysis. She's also the best-selling author of In This Economy: How Money and Markets Really Work. Um, so, uh, Cal, I think you are an inspiration. And one of the things I tell people is we were one of the I found you on Tik Tok, I think, and I remember forwarding I think this was like two years ago. I remember forwarding the Tik Tok to our producer saying, "We have to have this woman on. She's just such such a unique voice." And I love One of the things I do like about these mediums is that raw talent does break through. You didn't have to go to CNBC or be a junior reporter at the Wall Street Journal for 15 years and finally get your shot and then get guest appearances on CNBC and then some, you know, at some point like 45 or 50 finally get your own platform. I I really do think you're a case study and one of the more positive things around social media and I'm so enjoying watching you [music] have a you know your career ascend. I think it's I think it's just fantastic and it's got to give a lot of young people a lot of confidence to [music] kind of bust out on their own. Anyways, keep doing what you're doing and very much appreciate your time today. >> Oh, thank you so much. [music] [music]
