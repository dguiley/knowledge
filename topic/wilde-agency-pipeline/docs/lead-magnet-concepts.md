# Lead Magnet Concepts

Exploring calculator/assessment ideas for Wilde Agency lead generation.

---

## Core Insight

The lead magnet should:
1. **Qualify** - Filter for funded prospects who haven't over-built
2. **Expose** - Reveal problems they didn't know they had
3. **Demonstrate** - Show expertise before the call
4. **Capture** - Get enough info to personalize outreach

---

## Concept A: Project Scope Calculator

**Name ideas:**
- "What Will It Really Take?" Calculator
- "Startup Build Estimator"
- "Project Reality Check"

**Flow:**
1. Describe your project (free text or guided)
2. Answer qualifying questions
3. Get realistic scope assessment

**Output reveals:**
- Timeline reality vs expectations
- Hidden complexity they didn't consider
- Resource/skill gaps
- Go-to-market blind spots

**Qualification signals:**
- Stage (idea vs funded vs revenue)
- Existing technical assets (none = good, lots = harder)
- Budget expectations vs reality

**Pros:** Broadly applicable, exposes scope creep problem
**Cons:** Generic, everyone does "calculators"

## Concept B: Venture Studio Pilot Application

**Name ideas:**
- "Wilde Builds Pilot Program"
- "AI-Accelerated Build Application"
- "Venture Studio Partner Application"

**Positioning:**
Wilde Agency as venture studio using AI to rapidly build products. Limited pilot spots available.

**Flow:**
1. Apply to be considered for pilot build
2. Describe project, market, funding status
3. We select ONE winner for free/discounted build
4. Every other applicant = qualified, warm lead

**The Hook:**
"We're selecting 1 startup to build their MVP using our AI-accelerated platform. Apply to be considered."

**Application captures:**
- Project description
- Market opportunity
- Funding status
- Timeline urgency
- Why they'd be a good fit

**Qualification built-in:**
- Funded? (question)
- Clear vision? (quality of description)
- Realistic expectations? (timeline answer)
- Decision maker? (who's applying)

**Follow-up for non-winners:**
"You weren't selected for the pilot, but your project scored well. Here's what we noticed: [personalized insight]. Want to explore working together?"

**Pros:**
- Creates urgency/scarcity
- Self-selects serious applicants
- "Application" frame = they're selling to YOU
- Every applicant is pre-qualified
- PR/content opportunity (announce winner)

**Cons:**
- Need to actually give away a build
- Lower volume than open calculator
- Need clear selection criteria

## Concept C: Vibe Coding Assessment

**Name ideas:**
- "Vibe Code Health Check"
- "AI-Built App Assessment"
- "Is Your Vibe Code Production-Ready?"

**Two variations:**

### C1: "Is Your Project a Vibe Candidate?"
For people considering vibe coding approach.

**Flow:**
1. Describe what you want to build
2. Answer questions about complexity, integrations, scale
3. Get assessment: Good candidate / Risky / Not suitable

**Output reveals:**
- Where vibe coding works vs breaks down
- Hidden complexity that AI can't handle well
- When you need senior engineering oversight

**Hook:** "Vibe coding is powerful but has limits. Find out if your project is a good fit."

### C2: "Vibe Code Audit" (External Inspection)
For people who already vibe-coded something.

**Flow:**
1. Submit URL of their vibe-coded app
2. We run automated + manual inspection
3. Deliver report on issues found

**What we'd check:**
- Security vulnerabilities (exposed keys, injection risks)
- Performance issues (N+1 queries, no caching)
- Scalability red flags (no connection pooling, etc)
- Code quality signals (if we can infer from behavior)

**Output:**
- Risk score
- Top 3-5 issues found
- "Here's what could break when you scale"

**Hook:** "Vibe coded your MVP? Let's see what's lurking under the hood."

**Pros:**
- Highly differentiated (no one else doing this)
- Demonstrates deep expertise
- Creates urgency ("these problems will bite you")
- Perfectly positions Wilde's "adult supervision" value prop

**Cons:**
- More complex to build
- Requires actual inspection work
- Limited to people who already have something

---

## Concept D: Hybrid - Pilot Application + Vibe Assessment

**Combine B + C:**

**Flow:**
1. Primary: Apply for Venture Studio Pilot
2. Secondary path: "Already built something? Get a free Vibe Code Audit"

**Two entry points, same destination:**
- Pre-build founders → Pilot application → Qualified leads
- Post-vibe founders → Audit → Qualified leads with known problems

---

## Recommendation

**Primary: Venture Studio Pilot Application (Concept B)**

Why:
- Best qualification (application = serious intent)
- Flips dynamic (they apply to you)
- Built-in scarcity/urgency
- Every applicant is a lead
- Content/PR opportunity
- Aligns with "venture studio using AI" positioning

**Secondary: Vibe Code Audit (Concept C2)**

Why:
- Catches different avatar (already built, hitting problems)
- Highly differentiated
- Demonstrates expertise viscerally
- Could be automated partially

**Consider later: Project Scope Calculator (Concept A)**

Why not now:
- More generic
- Less qualification power
- Better as nurture content than lead magnet

---

## Target Avatar Refinement

Based on your feedback, two avatars emerge:

### Avatar 1: Funded Pre-Build Founder
- Has capital (seed, angel, or revenue from elsewhere)
- Hasn't built much yet (or willing to start fresh)
- Needs to move fast
- Values senior guidance

**Lead magnet:** Pilot Application
**Pain:** "I have money and an idea but don't know how to execute without burning runway"

### Avatar 2: Existing Business Needing Internal Tools
- Already has revenue/business
- Needs software for operations, not a startup product
- Has budget allocated
- Not emotionally attached to existing code

**Lead magnet:** Project Scope Calculator or direct outreach
**Pain:** "I need a tool for my business but don't have technical team"

### Avatar to AVOID
- No funding, hoping to raise after MVP
- Already built significant codebase with another team
- Looking for cheapest option
- Wants to "learn to code" themselves

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Choose primary lead magnet concept
2. [ ] Define pilot application questions
3. [ ] Design selection criteria (what makes a good pilot?)
4. [ ] Create landing page copy
5. [ ] Build application flow (Typeform? Custom?)
6. [ ] Plan "non-winner" follow-up sequence
