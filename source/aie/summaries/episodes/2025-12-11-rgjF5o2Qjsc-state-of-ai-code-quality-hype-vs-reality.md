# State of AI Code Quality Hype vs Reality

Edomar Friedman, CEO of Kodto, presents a comprehensive analysis of AI's impact on software development, emphasizing the need for quality management amidst the rapid adoption of AI code generation tools.

## Core Thesis
The integration of AI in code generation significantly boosts productivity but introduces critical quality challenges that can lead to outages and security issues. Effective code review processes and dynamic quality frameworks are essential to harness AI's potential fully.

## Key Insights
- Up to 60% of code is AI-generated or influenced, but this leads to concerns over code quality due to frequent outages.
- Over 67% of developers express concerns about the quality of AI-generated code, highlighting a need for improved review frameworks.
- Developers report increased efficiency yet spending more time resolving issues, pointing to a deficit in current quality evaluation frameworks.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Implement rigorous post-generation code reviews to ensure AI-generated code meets necessary quality standards.
2. Develop and maintain dynamic quality frameworks to manage AI-related variability in code quality.
3. Invest in AI-powered code review tools and testing methods to boost trust and reliability in AI-generated outputs.
4. Establish a context engine to maintain and enhance the quality of software development data.

## Notable Quotes
> "We need to be rigorous about how we deal with quality."

> "Quality is your competitive edge over your competition."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
Investing in AI-powered code review tools and dynamic quality frameworks can improve product reliability, reduce development time spent on resolving issues, and maintain a competitive edge through superior software quality.
