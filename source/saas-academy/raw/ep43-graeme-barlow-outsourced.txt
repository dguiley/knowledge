how do we make sure once we're started working together that we we contribute to success rather than you know sabotaging the relationship you should spend a reasonable amount of time doing design work ux work and product requirement definition before you write any code so that you have a very clear understanding of what is being built going through the process of like not having clearly defined goals not having a very clear understanding between founder and agency of what is being built what will it look like what will it feel like um and what is the effort required there does not set anyone up for Success it's August 2024 and there's a lot of chatter and excitement around AI I think it's still somewhere between novelty and utility I'm curious you you can't possibly be in the industry you're in and not be thinking about and observing what's happening with AI how's it impacting the work that you're doing and where do you see it going today we're talking to gra Barlo an entrepreneur investor and business coach you got over 20 years of experience founding five companies you've coached hundreds more and sold two companies first million dollar exit coming before the age of 20 which I was not building businesses at the age of 20 I was chasing a a golf baller on a golf course so uh first exit on your belt then you went on to build rocket Al which is a game development company that you would then go on to sell the private Equity you co-founded prop pet software um which no longer involved on the daily basis in that business but doing has over 5 million monthly customers doing over 10 million in annual revenue and then as if you needed anything else on your plate uh you are the CEO and partner at ioft a software development agency uh which you've got a team of over 50 people and are doing eight figures in Revenue in that business so I'm super excited Graham welcome to the podcast thank you for having me I'm excited to be here yeah it's GNA be fun this is I got to say I'm excited and nervous because I am non-technical so I have ton to learn from you I'm super excited about I feel both qualified and unqualified to be having this conversation um but man there's two things that I'd love to get out of this and what I'm sure we'll find lots more but um I'd love to talk about the good the bad the best practices of using outsourced development if you're a software founder whether you're technical or non-technical you've definitely you you you're confronted with the decision either to or not to go down that path and so I'd love to just like tap into your years of experience in that area and then you also have a track record of company building of getting results through other people figuring out a way to scale companies becoming the Lynch pin that keeps it from growing or being able to be sold so I think there's a lot to unpack there so let's let's start off with there's a lot of Founders especially non-technical that treat Outsource development the same way they treat getting out of founder Le sales and that is that they're out of it the day they make the higher and and I say so frequently you know when you're getting out of founder Le sales you're just moving into founder Le Sales Management um so you don't get to be like oh cool now the revenue is coming in and I think that that's the same thing that applies on when you're Outsourcing your development team you know talk me through the best practices especially around when to even consider like who's this right for who's it not right for you know when should someone be Outsourcing their development yeah the honestly awesome questions and such an interesting topic to jump into especially for non-technical Founders that might be approaching it for their first time like I'm sure we have all seen in our inbox probably hundreds of emails from firms all over the world being like cheapest Dev resources hire a team tomorrow we'll get you into Market 30 days like you get your first 60 days of devs free join us and like the noise in the space is crazy and I mean you see a lot of the talent locally as well and for me there's a couple big things that typically skew towards it is a good time to look at an Outsource team um and one really comes down to your founding team because and I say this kind of irrespective of discipline like we're going to talk about development right now but this this applies to a lot of the other roles is if as a founding group or if you're especially if you're solo non-technical founder and you don't have the expertise yourself to know how to hire attract and hire good technical Talent your odds of success are going to be significantly improved if you can find a partner that knows how to attract retain and vet good talent that that's kind of the Baseline so if you're looking at a technology build and you don't know you haven't run sprints you don't know what scrum means you haven't run jira or Source control or like if all of these words are foreign to you it's probably a good bet to find a partner to work with at least for your first build um until you get to a point where you can bring in the right technical expertise in house to help you build and run a team as either a co-founder or a CTO or like a senior leader like if you're at that stage where you don't have the capacity necessarily to bring in that senior technical leadership and you're you are going to rely on a partner to get you to the first big milestone or through the first big milestone um I I think there's a ton of value in that you have to be we'll talk about it after you have to be very careful about how you find that partner and who you choose to bring in as an outside agency um but for me that's one of the biggest things the other time where external uh Talent works and this is actually where ioft kind of got its start in this space is if you are a technical team but your domain expertise is say in one of the verticals like say you've got a very good web and backend team and nobody in your group has touched mobile hiring a mobile partner to kind of run in parallel with you and accelerate that so that you're focused on core product and core technology and not distracting your energy to try and go learn a whole new Tex stack and whole new QA process and buy a 100 devices to test on and all of that stuff I think that can be very powerful um on the flip side if you have great access to good talent and I see this a lot in like uh startups that spin out of like computer science schools in Canada the good context is like waterl um if you can get a really strong technical founding team and you're all pushing together keep development in house you don't have to push it outside but in that case probably find coaches mentors other people that have done scale up of technology to bring in and kind of teach you guys what you don't know um yeah so I think that's maybe maybe the longer answer of like when when it makes sense okay now what are the different models that someone can engage with Outsource agency are we trading Equity are we you know just as an hourly are we you know is it Project based how how do you typically engage with Outsource development yeah so again interesting question and I think you'll if you if you jump into the market about Source development you will see every model Under the Sun there there are kind of venture Studios that like to do product development in exchange for Equity that can be a very interesting model sometimes very expensive um the default behavior that I see especially from kind of firsttime Founders or business owners that are getting into software development typically look for or are aiming for a fixed price contract so so they're like I have a generally Loosely or somewhat poorly defined technical scope of work of what I want built and I want an exact price and a guarantee that I'm going to get the thing for that price um and then you also have kind of more of a retainer model where it's I'm going to have a certain amount of resources for a certain amount of time at a monthly cost and we're going to build towards a scope of work I have personal bias towards which which one of those I think is is strongest but sorry I think you're going to jump into the question no yeah I'm I'm just curious like what are the pros and cons if someone's if they don't want to learn from you know the School of Hard Knocks what are the models that you see have some Merit and then what are the ones that maybe were you should stay away from yeah so part of the answer I think depends on scope and complexity of the project if you're looking at smaller projects and simpler Solutions I'm a big fan of fixed bit I think if you're if it's kind of a 30 to 60 days worth of effort you want very concentrated Focus I think having an exact price for that is absolutely a great model to go after everyone kind of goes in eyes open and understands what's what you're going to get what effort is involved and companies can price it usually fairly well where I've seen that model run into a lot of trouble and people get burned and relationships get really St strained is when you try and use that fixed bit model over 6 12 18-month projects where there's a lot more complexity um anyone in software development I understand it's like nothing ever goes kind of exactly the way you anticipated it upfront and especially in a product Journey for a new company there's usually a lot of decisions that pivot over time as you get more customers as you get more exposure and what I find in fixed bid is everyone starts out excited but ultimately the alignment and the goals of all companies aren't really aligned very well um the purchasing company or the founder is looking to get as much value and as much functionality as they possibly can for the kind of contract and the price they went into it with and the agency or the Outsource shop is trying to protect as much profitability as they possibly can in that fixed amount of money and time and so they're going to their project management team will be tasked with keep customer happy but defend budget at all costs and when faced with kind of right but more complex decision or fast and works for now decision will defer to fast and works for now hopefully and every time there's a change in scope or a change in product requirements which happens every good company pivots every good company shifts when they get more feedback and they learn more about their product you're in this contentious position where it's either a change request or you're trading features and I just I've I've not seen it work well for large projects it's great for small projects It's usually the first model people jump into when they Outsourcing work even if they're doing large projects but I haven't seen it work well what I've seen work well is more of the retainer model with a scope of work here is the goal poost of 10 of 12 months and you run it iteratively in weekly or bi-weekly Sprints and but not so fixed that you eliminate the flexibility it means that the companies on both sides are aligned to like make the best decision in that Sprint for the product for the end goal and if you overd deliver if you succeed you kind of renew and keep going um and so at least in in 15 years of doing this through hoft that's where we've seen the biggest wins biggest success and some of our largest accounts have been with us for three four five years now and I think our longest is 11 years years running on on models like that and it's it's something that took me a long time to realize why the more obvious model which like is the fixed bid didn't really work long term um but it's been that's been kind of the biggest learning for me so let me make sure I understand the the ideal model so the challenge with the fixed bid is you're exactly right there's the incentive for the agency is to stay just above the we're going to get fired line so least amount of resources deployed to keep keep the client the unlock to a better model is making sure that those are smaller projects that they that the big project is chunk down is that what you're getting at so it's still fixed bid but it's smaller scope projects along the way so you kind of earn earn the right to continue working together if fixed bid is the model you want to go for finding yeah finding more package deliverables like smaller scope things single feature sets um simple MVPs that works really well but as soon as you're in kind of a long-term build and sustain I haven't seen it work well what yeah what is the model of your long-term building sustain like because I I would imagine there's Founders listening to this conversation that say you know I I don't ever plan on hiring internally you know I I was had enough to get the business off the ground whether it was through an Outsource agency and I'm growing up in in and working with a different one um or or they've started on some low code no code solution and now they need to actually own their product they're saying hey I I'm I'm going to use an Outsource team long term what's the the model how do you keep so incentives Drive Behavior right so how do we keep the incentives aligned to the outcomes of the business not just of getting more work um especially for a tech you know a Founder that's non-technical yeah so two things that I would say are important to that um one is going to be renewal cycle it's like I love the retainer model retainer model um and I mean selfishly as an agency longer retainer is better however I think as a client if your if your renewal cycle is kind of a six-month basis it's enough time to get significant work done and hit significant Milestones but not so long that there's complacency on either side we like oh we can really underperform or underd deliver and we're just guaranteed work forever like if you if you're kind of fighting to show value every six months and you're doing that at Cadence I think that it's at least where I've seen kind of The Sweet Spot of those longer term team retainers I also think as a Founder um if you're working with an agency fight to understand the rate you're paying right like I'm I'm not a big fan of kind of Blended hourly rates for long-term engagements because there's so much that gets packed into and buried in that you can find agencies to work with where you have a lot more transparency like kind of here's your base team salary costs and like if you have super senior people it's going to be more expensive if you have super junior people it's going to be cheaper um and then what are the markups that are added to that and do they seem fair and reasonable for the value that you're getting for not having to manage that um one trap I do see sometimes um early Founders that are maybe new to the space fall into is they look at the raw salary of like I could hire a Dev for 100 150 200 Grand whatever it is the location you're in Industry you're in whatever um and therefore that's the cost I should be kind of paying an external shop and remembering that there's a lot more that goes into kind of retaining that person because you also don't want a company that has high turnover you don't want to be constantly teaching new people what your project is even if it's not your problem to go find them and hire them guess what you're still paying for the time to train them and onboard them and the lost efficiency so one of the things I look at when we look at external partners for ioft or honestly for any of our other companies is like go on glass store if the agency or the company you're talking to has really bad reviews on glass door from employees and seems to have really high turnover they're probably going to have really high turnover on your project team and even if that's kind of hidden behind the wall and somewhat obscured um that constant ramp up ramp down time on your team is extremely expensive uh so yeah digging digging into that can be can be huge when when you select and it's not always a like inherently obvious thing to go look for Graeme let's let's build a little bit of The Hit List the hot principles or processes that should be in place if we're trying to build an ideal scenario what I'm trying to give the founder listening to this call is almost the litmus test to be like hey am I getting the most out of my development team if I do consider working with an Outsource development team the benefit of listening into a conversation like this is that you don't have to go to the School of Hard Knock to to learn learn how to work really well with an Outsource team so let's give some you unpack for me of the the clients and the characteristics of either the companies that you've ran that have used Outsource development or the clients that you've served at ioft what are they doing that leads to a successful relationship with their teams awesome let's I mean let's try and maybe make a top five hit list of what to what to look for if you're hiring if you're hiring an external company first thing I would say is talk to other clients that have worked with the agency MH it's crazy how many people I know that hire agencies marketing software or otherwise and they look at a portfolio sheet on a website or they look at um I don't know a slick sheet that they get in a deck and don't dig further we do more checking references on 20 to $50 an hour employees than we sometimes do on million dooll agency hires so first one is like talk to other customers active and past actually talk to them um if somebody's especially if they've got smaller companies on their portfolio whether or not they're willing to introduce you reach out reach out on LinkedIn reach out and just say hey what was your like I see your brand on this company site what was your experience with them good bad indifferent um hugely valuable the other one we touched on is check out the company on glass store um this is true marketing and software agency like you want to find a partner that does not have crazy high turnover and has some degree of employee satisfaction because again you don't want to be picking up up the tab on someone else's poorly man managed HR and recruitment process and whether the costing is transparent or not you're paying for that if there is turnover there's a lot that the founder has to contribute to the success of this relationship right so I'm curious like what what do they need to do to get the most out of the you know this is you know maybe it's clear communication maybe it's like you know there's probably some element of a product management role in there to make sure we're building the right stuff like you know let's we give the founders some ownership in this too let's assume we found a great agency how do we make sure once we're started working together that we we contribute to success rather than you know sabotaging the relationship I love it so you I think you hit hit the nail on the head on that product ownership side um one thing and I I'll I'll be entirely honest like this took me probably six or seven years into software development to properly appreciate and have the patience for the product role in general but if you're looking to Outsource we've all heard kind of proper preparation the I don't know the acronym but like preparation it's a big thing um spending time upfront whether you do it internally yourself or with an agency that you're selecting you should spend a reasonable amount of time doing design work ux work and product requirement definition before you write any code so that you have a very clear understanding of what is being built and this is something that like has become part of our core process at ioft wasn't five years ago um but again School of Hard kns and like going through the process of like not having clearly defined goals not having a very clear understanding between founder and agency of what is being built what will it look like what will it feel like um and what is the effort required there does not set anyone up for success and I think the founder ownership part of that is being very accountable to the fact that once you've set that it's okay to change and it's okay to learn more from customers it's okay to Pivot the vision but recognizing kind of the consequences of your actions and so being able to have a very clear and open relationship with your partner or your internal team or wherever of if you get inspired at midnight and want to jump in and be like okay instead of this feature I want this feature and you're I don't know two sprints into building that thing understand the impact that can have on timeline and budget for that change so sometimes that change is worth it sometimes it's not this is actually where on the business coaching side I spent a fair bit of time with Founders being like before you just parachute in on your team and change something go talk to a bunch of customers go validate this with a a meaningful amount of people before you change the the thing that's already running on the tracks because there there's significant impact there the other thing especially for non-technical Founders that I would say is is huge is build a network of trusted technical advisers or resources outside of the agency relationship that you set up or the internal team relationship because it's very easy especially for us and it's I I love that you credit me as a technical founder I have I've kind of like been able to run Incognito as a quasi technical founder for a long time um the last time I wrote any meaningful code was like 22 years ago um I I I set up like geoc city sites and basic scripts way back in the day and since then I know enough to like look at what I what I see but I deal with the people side of it but I navigate that by surrounding myself with phenomenally smart technical people so that when I'm in a situation I'm like ah something doesn't feel right why why is this thing taking longer than kind of my gut intuition feels like it should before I jump down on a team before I go ask a bunch of potentially difficult questions I have two or three people external that I can go and say hey here's the thing we're doing here's what I'm concerned about does this make sense to you and 50% of the time I get a good response it's like oh yeah no that's super weird go dig into that other times it's like oh you have no idea how complicated that is it's a miracle you're getting it done as fast as you are and it's like okay back in lane and uh go focus on sales so that kind of support network is huge all right cool so I've got when we're selecting the agency make sure we check the references make sure we check the glass store ratings to avoid a agency where there's a lot of turnover on the founder side making sure there's clear product ownership and preparation right the Outsource development is going to go where you are pointing them if you're pointing them in a direction that you're not certain about or it's not very uh defined we can go but we might not where we want to where we want to be and then uh fourth is building a network of trusted advisers some people who can kind of triangulate as you're learning about this relationship what good looks like you have some people that you can come in that could do a thirdparty audit that can help you P you see if something passes a smell test while you're learning the ropes on on what it looks like anything else uh the other one is just I think maybe speaks to founder impatience a little bit um and you can get some pretty negative signals that some people think are good signals what I mean by that is if you talk to an outsourc company and they can kick off development for you or kickoff a project next week that's a massive red flag for me and I I'm a big fan of speed I'm a big fan to go fast the reality is if you're looking for a quality partner and somehow they just magically have a bench of people sitting around doing nothing waiting for you to walk through the front door and be like let's go um I would be very concerned about the sustainability of that business model the good agencies we've worked with and our own world is typically anywhere from 30 to 90 days to get something kicked off to have capacity to have the right people to do it and I mean generally that's the timing that's going to happen in the background anyway um but sometimes sales organizations just be like oh yeah know we'll we'll launch this tomorrow and it's like with who like your bench of people that were Idol what if I hadn't shown up were you guys going to shut down like MH so that for me is always an interesting one to just watch for when I hire third party vendors like I want I want somebody that's busy that's fitting me into their capacity because they're in demand not somebody that's like oh thank God you walk through the front door now we eat tomorrow like yeah yeah yeah that's that's a big one I'm sure you've seen a few wins and a few losses um if the goal of this conversation is to help Founders learn from other people's mistakes when have you seen this go wrong yeah so unfortunately forun fortunately we we have definitely seen our share of horror stories over the years um one thing that might be potentially surprising if other people are kind of in the similar space is a a pretty significant amount of R deal flow actually comes from being brought in as third-party Auditors to either boards or senior Executives they're saying we're not sure about the state of this project we don't actually know how to go check can we pay you guys to come in sometimes anonymously sometimes visibly and publicly um and just check check what's going on because it's been longer than it should be or we're way over budget and we can't get a clear timeline um and honestly oftentimes it's been a bit of a failing on the part of the company or the founder not having that network of technical advisers or kind of trusted resources to be able to dig in and like we've been brought in by Boards in the past check projects that are in the seven figures that are years or month like significant amount of time in and and think typically it's been overseas teams where we're being brought in because communication has broken down for some reason or deadlines have had missed and in the most extreme example we got into a bunch of source code and source code is probably generous this team have been supposedly working on this for about two years what we ended up finding was a bunch of screenshots that were kind of animated made it a map together and virtually no code and unfortunately any external technical resource brought in before probably would have caught it pretty quickly but there had been it it was a very cheap shop it there's a lot of other things going on in the business and so nobody was really paying attention and as long as they kind of sort of presented pictures at each each check-in quarterly it was allowed to go on longer than it should have um and so yeah it's it's a tough space and so do do the work to make sure you're protected like trust good partners and I think that's amazing but good partners are also not going to be upset if you say hey here's our fractional CTO they're going to do a quarterly check-in on where things are at to just make sure decisions are aligned with where we want to go with the company and the budget makes sense like I think if if you end up in a situation where a partner is very resistant to that I that would also be a big red flag for me so yeah makes a ton of sense uh it's August 20124 and there's a lot of chatter and excitement around AI I think it's still somewhere between novelty and utility I'm curious you you can't possibly be in the industry you're in and not be thinking about and observing what's happening with AI like where do you where do you how's it impacting the work that you're doing and where do you see it going yeah Al so I mean I love AI as a topic I I think it's super interesting it's where where do I see it in my world I think every inbound conversation we have with a company is some flavor of what should we be doing with AI how do we build AI how do we integrate AI um what is AI and I think you nailed it on the top of the head in terms of like where it's actually at today is probably further ahead than a lot of people expected it to be but not as far ahead as the media and a lot of people make it out to be if that makes sense so like we're we are playing with it in every facet of the company from marketing I think I've tested or tried every AI LinkedIn outbound SDR tool on the market with virtually no success um we've also tried a lot of the AI code compilers we're seeing phenomenal results from AI co-pilot like code oversight um it's very powerful in content marketing um we've got some internal test pilots that are super fun where we've got a bunch of AI agents where you can give them kind of a scope of work and it kind of creates agents of itself doing project management product management ux code QA and then you see it all run um that's pretty surreal and crazy and we've been able to have it deliver fairly functional web apps um completely falls apart today doing mobile work um don't know why don't have the depth of understanding to really explain why but that's that's what we've seen so far so I think it's getting there where I've actually been resistant and we've pushed back on a couple clients that have come to us asking to build like super custom AI tools for them um has been the rate at change at the big players I'm a big fan of building stuff that integrates and works with the kind of existing leading llms and allows you to leverage them somewhat interchangeably a little bit like how we look at kind of cloud infrastructure right now it's like nobody really thinks about like I don't know too deep on what cloud hosting is as long as you've got the right partner and you can plug into Google cloud or AWS or Azure or whatever um I'm I'm trying to approach AI at least for the level of client and the level of investment we're dealing with in a similar way of like let's build stuff that leverages the llms Builds on top of it but isn't going to wipe out your project investment if open AI releases this thing tomorrow so like how do you how do you build on top of but not become dependent on um because we've seen so many product companies just get murdered every time a new version of GPT comes out every time a new version of Cl comes out um and so I'm trying to caution people about how and where they're investing to build tools that are augment and grow from it um like we're seeing so many customer service chat applications um access and interpretation of data that literally is just if you've got a core data source and llms can give you better access to it for your employees for your customers for your Ecom optimization I love that because that only gets better as everyone's AI advances and gets better stronger faster um if you're going we want to build our own model to do better Instagram tags and posts not not keen on that because may maybe you win maybe you get wiped out by the companies that are spending billions of dollars on this on Engineers you can't afford so that's that's kind of been my take I I have no idea where it's going to be in the next two or three years we're trying to be as agile as possible and create as much space in the organization as we can to experiment and we've kind of at least from an ioft perspective we've taken the philosophy of like one or two champions in each department get to go live in the weeds of the news and the updates every week everyone else kind of lives with working with tools we've picked and learn how to use them really well and integrate them into a process what I don't think you can do is have the entire organization consuming all of the updates every day every week because there is new AI stuff every day and every week and it is an exhausting route race to try and stay on top of what's new what you should be pivoting to how you should use it Etc um yeah it needs to be on the road map you need to have some intention of like staying on top of it what's doing in your in your industry and how do you how do you leverage what's working today but don't get caught up in the fantasy of like oh it's going to completely replace senior strategic direction tomorrow it might in a year it's not there today and we sorry one one last thought on that because this is common we've had a lot of requests of like can I feed it this Excel doc this database this whatever of kind of unstructured stuff or can I build a tool where my clients can feed at this stuff and at least what we've seen is none of the models today handle unstructured garbage particularly well so in in the dream of like it will just interpr 40 flavors of a p&amp;l and meaningfully understand how everybody has set it up and structured it it's not there yet it's it's just going to spiral on bad data um I think it'll get there but um it's still in the stage where you need to put good stuff in to get good stuff out yeah yeah totally makes sense as a customer success guy at heart that has done hundreds and hundreds of data Imports to get a client onboarded I know there are a lot of people looking forward to the uh the innovation in that area uh man too many hours spent you know fixing Excel files to get them ready import ready I'm curious though um lots of low code no code Solutions popping up in the last several years uh I can't tell you the number of SAS Academy clients alone that are built on some type of wh labeled solution and I personally love it for the MVP like it's it's incredible while you're in the in those early stages trying to figure out what the product needs to look like really cool how quickly you can iter iterate now challenge is a lot of times Enterprise Value is it really takes a hit if we're built on some type of um you know white labeled solution and uh if you're going to build a company to sell you probably need to be you know be able to own your own code and IP I'm curious you're also an investor how do you see no code you sit in this really cool intersection of someone who evaluates the value of software companies and then also you know is has to be impacted by some of the low code no code stuff how do you see that Trend playing out I love that Trend I love it so much and I think it is so unbelievably powerful for companies to leverage early on for MVP prototype even early days of scale up like you can do you can do a phenomenal amount of stuff on a lot of the no code tools and I think in some Industries like like we've we've talked to a lot in like the influencer space that want to build communities or want to build their own Ecom ecosystem like I think if you can lean into no code all the way through on that amazing um for companies that are doing more of the SAS play where they are going to grow up into Enterprise and they are going to hit a stage where you need more complex Integrations where you need better data and analytics tools you need kind of to grow up on an even security or sock compliance side of things um you very rapidly outgrow it and so I I I like a model where um especially in SAS companies you you see kind of a no code very much MVP version to prove sales and marketing engine can you can you deliver value is the is the fundamental idea good but very early in that road map i' be looking for an engineering plan that says okay here's our first 24 months running and selling on no code 12 months in is when we start building our own version and by month 36 we've kind of shifted into our own ecosystem fully where we have control and we can go into those Enterprise environments and we can really achieve scale because um I've also lived through building on no code Solutions on no code platforms that then go under and disband and shut down and typically the the code behind the no code because there is still code um isn't great to try and get access to and fix or build if the underlying company that provided it dies um and that's a huge vulnerability for companies long term like I think there's big enough players on the space that you can kind of bet that they're not going to go anywhere but I say that and I also live through the Facebook games era when we were building rocket all where Facebook was turning on and shutting off features in their games ecosystem on a weekly basis and like you build around one feature one day and two weeks later' be like in a release notes thing of like oh we deleted that move fast break things and it's like yeah Jesus if you're if you're in somebody else's world you are at their will and long term I don't like companies that are staked on that but I think it is one of the best ecosystems ever for launching and prototyping companies if you can get to the functionality that you need to prove value yeah cool I love it um let's shift gears because you are you are a company Builder you are someone who has despite the number of different uh you know roles and industries and companies you've been in you've figured out a way not to get stuck as the Lynch pin where the business built around you in fact when you and I were chatting prior to turning this on you said something you said I'm I've become allergic to being the most important person in the business can you say more about that yeah well it's it's it's funny people people always ask like what's your superpower what's your what's the thing you're good at and I joke in that um one of one of my superpowers I think is that I'm kind of allergic to hard work um and it's not to say that I don't like doing hard work building companies but I I I do not like and have like a physical visceral reaction to being the person that is responsible for doing the thing in the business and that that kind of always been the case largely because I've always been surrounded by people who are way smarter and way better at it than I am and so I've gotten very good at being able to see Market opportunities where we can create value but not building in a way that I am the person that has to deliver that I'm building in a way that I can I will go find the client I will go find the pain I will go find the problem and on the other side also go find the people who are really good at solving it and kind of build the company by by matching the two and it actually took me a little while into kind of building to realize that that's not necessarily a fully normal way that a lot of people start companies and so a lot of a lot of work that I've done since then is helping um generally people way smarter than me and Founders that have kind of built companies around their core skill set learn how to extract themselves from that because if your whole company is built on you doing the thing or you owning the delivery of the thing unbelievably hard and stressful to scale that business um which isn't fun so but if you're a Founder a lot of times the success of early success in a business comes from this hey I I I get done like I'm the person that rolls up the sleeves and I'm the motor in the business if this is all you've known I can imagine someone you know listening to you talk about being allergic to doing the thing in the business and it almost sounding like a foreign country a foreign concept so how does someone know how do we start to wake up a Founder to know if they've built the business around themselves in a way that at some point reaches a ceiling um H how do you you coach Founders yourselves how do you work them through this chall yeah well the first the first question is always and this is a fun one because you can kind of see the reaction in their face before they say anything was if I could bring you enough customers tomorrow to double your business how do you feel and typically Founders that have a good system around them and aren't in the weeds are like oh that's awesome bring it on let's let's talk about that more often than not you see Panic F first reaction is panic like if I had twice as many people to deal with I feel overwhelmed and I don't know how to deal with that and I would just have to work every hour of every minute of every day and it sucks and getting to that point of realization like literally the thing you're talking about wanting to do like if we doubled your business or 10x your business or whatever um if that induces Panic you need to recognize there's something wrong in the system that you've built and we need to start working you out of that process and I mean like this has been this been a curring theme business forever I I I mean I know SAS Academy and like Dan buy back your time like same kind of philosophy right of like do not get stuck but so many people as you said they start off doing what they know and they're really good at it and there's so many layers of that trap that gets built up over time like if you've built the brand around you and your charisma and your specific take you also kind of get stuck in the mentality that like I have sold me to my customers therefore it must be me doing the work therefore must be me taking the calls I've even talked to SAS Founders that are like it must be me doing customer service because that's how my customers know me and came on board it's like ultimately you got to you got to shift that from me being the thing doing to my vision and then the machine that I have built to deliver against the vision and the value that we're pitching and the value that we're proposing under guidance and oversight versus kind of your hands hands on it every day it's such a tough shift for some people to make especially psychologically when your selfworth a lot of times comes from the what you have known as productive the definition that we set up for productivity and it you you start to accelerate the growth of your business when it shifts from being the things that you accomplish yourself to the things that you accomplish through your team and man if you can push through that that uncomfortable Zone it is a skill to be built it just shift from hey I'm building a product or a service to I'm building a company and look that doesn't always have to be you might say I love I love being in the product and I love being in the service but it's knowing what lights you up and then hiring a team around you that if you have Ambitions of growing a company that is building Enterprise Value becomes more profitable and maybe even one day sells you you H you cannot be the Lynch p in the business and we have to be able to to remove you from the day-to-day operation and the business keeps on running so um I'm curious when did you make that shift personally like was this just something early on you just this was the default or did you have to get through that cycle of the thing that builds self worth is not the things I achieve but the things that I achieve through through the business Al the good news is I seem to like to just keep relearning this lesson over and over again um so like in our first company we were we were kids and what we were doing and that was like my first exposure to even basic programming and I very quickly realized I had way more fun dealing with people on eBay and talking to like customers than I did trying to figure out and solve programming problems so that was one where I like self- selected out of the technology side and just like the rest of you seem to love this I like dealing with people in the comment section on eBay or the transaction side on eBay so like I'm going to go do that you this and we all kind of scaled up that way at Rocket owl I learned it painfully um when I started out owning everything related to game design and the economic modeling in the game because I was super excited about i' I've been a gam my whole life I was like oh my God I get to build a game and then I was like six months in of spreadsheets and calculations and being like I'm bad at this I I I I thought I was good at this I like the idea of this but I'm like 18-hour days over and over again and then I sit down with somebody that like actually is good at this and like oh that's broken that's broken that's broken and I hit a point where it's like I can either learn to be really good at this or get the hell out of the way and hand this to somebody else and that was like time to learning of like don't just put your head down and grind through it because you think you should um recognize that no no matter how good you are at what your thing is there are other people that are better and equally passionate and if you can kind of align them on a vision that gets them excited and hand it off to them and get out of the way uh things tend to be way more successful um I went through the same thing at ivosoft when I first started out like we when we when I joined we were a team of six and really didn't have sales infrastructure really didn't have stuff and I kind of took ownership of sales and marketing and growth and again very quickly suffered from my own success got a bunch of sales opportunities got a bunch of leads and then just died in the paperwork and the Nuance of like make the proposal do I was so much energy doing all the calls and meeting all the people and connecting everyone and then like grind to a halt and just like suffer in the like doing of the detail stuff and then do it poorly and then have people catch mistakes in it and again very quickly was able to start reflect a couple months in like I am miserable and if I had twice as many opportunities I'm not excited about that that would suck that's a lot of paperwork and then hiring and recognizing that we found people that were like I love building proposals I hate going in unprepared to in front of a bunch of people and trying to sell stuff but like give me give me the details give me the documents and I was like oh my God this is great and yeah so that was it it's been I don't know self-inflicted that I put myself into roles that I realize I really don't like and don't thrive in and then fortunately been able to kind of pull myself out of pretty quickly once I recognize that that's not the place I should be and every time I've done that and I've done it over and over again every time I hit these layers where it's like oh my God I'm drowning in X whatever whatever it is and then I'm able to kind of build a team replace it and get myself out of it we go faster we go bigger we unlock and I end up happier so it's easy to forget that lesson when you're in the thick of it but if you keep kind of looping back to it and learning it it's it's crazy how much of a pck it is and how much you actually build enjoy what you're building yeah I love it man where can people follow along if they've uh Lear want to learn more about ioft want to follow along your journey where can people follow yeah I'm gram Barlo on all social media platforms or gram bar.com um and if there's anything I can help with hit me up on Instagram I'm always always excited to uh chat with Founders that are that are growing we also invest in early stage B2B SAS companies um yeah would love to would love to connect I love it man lots of stuff that we unpacked today as a recap I love talking about you know when to bring on the when to bring on an Outsource development team for that first build making sure you got a partner or trusted advisor someone that you can work with if you're non-technical founder to do that first build uh we talked through the different models the challenges with mixed uh with fixed bids the uh misaligned incentives and some ways to properly structure a work with an Outsource development team to get the most out of them we talked the five hot principles to make sure that not only are we choosing the right person but that we are managing that relationship well so that leads to success we got some uh insights on the evolution of AI where we at in the time onine here revolution's coming we're somewhere in the middle of it um and then the right ways to be building it into your product uh today um and then we shift it to the company building side and avoiding the Trap of being stuck as a Lynch pin um and really building that muscle of attracting the the right team and uh letting them go to work to build a vision so uh Graham tons to to extract from today's episode really appreciate you taking the time to join um but it'll be uh it'll be fun staying in touch and appreciate you taking the time thanks for having me man this was awesome appreciate it [Music]
