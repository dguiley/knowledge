Published: 2024-06-04

in this video I going to show you how you can come up with new business ideas find new niches that you would probably never have thought of within trust Pilots but we are not only going to use trust pilot of course uh we are going to go through a series of steps and use AI so we can extract as many information as we can about the companies we find as well as extract informations about what the the customers are saying uh we are going to scrap manually everything so we can run um this prompts that I have prepared and we will come up with like potential uh Improvement of the product new ideas sub niches and so on so if you are in the process of finding a new business idea um researching a certain market for your product then stick until the end because you might find uh a lot of value in this um video and maybe find your next business idea by the end so how are we going to do that um the first thing is uh I'm going to just have a quick look at trustpilot what it is and what we are exactly looking for then I'm going to go to walk you through the whole process here in figmma uh and then the third part of the video will be me doing the exact process uh from scratch without I decid I wanted to do it with a niche that I already found so the video would flow a little bit but I thought it would be a little bit more interesting if I go without knowing what I'm going to find so we are going to do it just together okay before we go further I just want to mention two things the first thing is that the file and the prompts I'm going to show you in the video you will find it for free in the description below so once you are done with ing the video you can just go ahead and download it directly the second thing is if you follow the channel already uh I would be really grateful if you could like the video right now if you have found values in the previous one so it would already help the video to be seen a little bit more and if you are not already following the channel it's okay you can wait until the end once you have found the value then I will just ask you to to like uh as well but not now now let's go into it so what is trust pilot trust pilot is basically a Marketplace I know it's not the world you you would thought of but it's a Marketplace between companies and customers but it is a worldwide one one right uh it is huge and it is made to create trust between companies and and customers the second effect of that is that this is a place where you can find pretty much every every company or at least every company that has a certain amount of customers so every company that has a certain market right and at the same time you can see how are customers Satisfied by this company or unsatisfied and there is this page which is quite awesome uh with trustpilot is the category page which is basically the page that contains every single Niche that you can think of so that's already really good start when you're looking for a business idea to ideate and and look at different Market that you you wouldn't have thought of right and this is this will be the starting point of our little journey so what we are what are we looking for on this page we are looking for high demand services or products with unmet expectations what it means is companies that have a large market share but customers are not happy with the service the company provides it also means that if the customers keep coming to the company it is because they don't have a better solution or it is also because the company has an unfair Advantage like let's say they are out there since 30 years they have Hugo traffic but that we are going to figure it out our goal is really to find things that we can use for us to start a business and how do we start the business then we could for for example focus on one single sub nich if we find a company that has a huge market then we can decide okay people are not happy with this specific part so let's focus on this one only or we can create a better offer or better product or even create a new solution using AI using new business models subscriptions whatever or we can also find a new acquisition Channel going back to the example I said if a company is us an SEO as the the most of the the market shares then we can decide to go on YouTube for example to promote the same kind of offer we already know there is a demand but that's enough for what we are looking for let's go back in the second part of the video which is the process we are going to go through so I told you already about the trust pilot category page this is where we are going to ideate and it will be the start we just pick a niche that attracts or trigger our interest then we have this huge company's list and we want to look at the highest number of reviews so we see the biggest ones and then we are looking for three four stars uh kind of range why three four stars um first because five means the the company is probably meeting the expectations of the customer customer and it is there is maybe there is an opportunity but it's harder to find uh so we are going to look at lower than that and one would be like the company has maybe a major problem or it's a scamming company or I don't really like um to go too too far but three four stars are basically where the customers are kind of happy not really they wish something a little bit different would exist but they didn't have found it yet so this is what we are going to to look for like this company this company for example would be good fit for us to start our research but we also want to find companies that have um high amount of reviews in this case for example it's not huge but it is fair enough it means there is a market uh when we go too high U those are huge company um generally um that own the niche uh so I suggest to stay in the range of uh yeah around a thousand reviews it is it's works well it's already a good Market okay now we pick a company to analyze the first thing we want to do is just to actually analyze the company before we go into the reviews for that we start by checking the website just to see if it's something that resonate uh with us like is it something that we want to to build um potential solution for this Market okay if yes uh I've prepared this prompt that is going to um gather all the information about the company just by giving it the we are going to use CH GPT we give the URL plus the prompt and we are going to get a complete document uh with all the different aspects and products of the companies as well as um potential keyword we can directly check on Google Trends which gives us a good idea of the market the company is evolving in just to know if we are going to pursue the research at this point we we don't want to do the rest if we haven't validate that here it is something worth postering okay what else are we checking from the company the traffic sources why because as I mentioned before we want to know if there is any unfair Advantage uh and what is the main source of traffic so we can think of potential different source of traffic first thing is always to um go and check every social like Facebook Instagram YouTube whatever just to see if there is any activity there then we want to check Facebook ads if the company is running ads uh in this case for example this company is not running ads um which is really interesting because this company had traffic and we want to check organic traffic whatever the website you want to use this is a suggest uh we want to see if there is is um a huge incoming traffic organically that was the case for this example okay now we decide this is a company we want to analyze that will potentially gives us more insight about the market what do we do now so the first thing we want to do is to sort them by most recent and just to scroll down to see if the last reviews are recent if the reviews are from last year probably the company is not really active uh anymore so it's not really um a good Insight that you would get so that's the the first thing to validate then we want to sort to only filter by two to four stars reviews for the same reason I I mentioned before we just want to keep these reviews because they are the most insightful don't pay attention here you will see one reviews because when I took the screenshot uh I didn't filter them before it doesn't matter okay then we start having a look if you want you can read them that's fine but then we are going to copy all of that and copy the next page and the next page as much as you want not too much but you want to gather all this Insight these long insights where the customers are explaining why they are not happy what they would like to find and so on and so forth and with that data that's pure gold data we are going to use this prompt that I've created for you which is to find Opportunities and it what it will do is um explain the con context um and ask for um finding new insights from Brand and the um customer reviews that we are going to give it and two things here sorry I know it's a little bit confusing here let me okay so as you can see here you have name of the brand major pain points so we have one part that is dedicated to how can we do the exact same thing but better and then Alternatives it is more like uh can we create the same product but focus on sub niches or different niches or can we use the same Market but to sell this Market with a different solution can we get some new solution from this Market um on new acquisition model and what are the different similar markets uh related to this um this BR and this is not meant to give you like the idea uh in a box for you to use it's more like you find something that has a good market so it is already good inside uh you make sure that the company is making probably making money but has some problem it means there there are some opportuni is out there and then this prompt is really uh getting the juice flowing like the uh it will give you ideas that will triggers something else and then you can go on on and on and make further research but at this stage you end up with this complete list which normally um is a very very good start for you to to continue your research okay now it is time to go and do the thing we were talking about hey just a quick break here the sponsor of this video is just me so I'm putting a lot of effort into creating things that you can uh really use and not only giving you strategies that are missing a lot of information uh and for that I would be extremely grateful if you can like this video and comment U anything you find valuable in this video as well as potential other topics you would like me to do videos for um that would help the channel to grow and to help more people like you to start their business so if you haven't already uh if you're not subscribed you can subscribe uh you can subscribe to the channel and um yeah like the video and we continue right now sorry for the interruption okay I really have no idea what we are going to find so don't be judgy please I will try not to um to edit it too much so you can see the mistakes and what's good and what's wrong okay um so let's first have a look at the major um markets so Beauty um pets pets huge market and obviously there are more than that as sub nishes but that's fine Home Restaurant shopping um government okay Health construction that's cool uh education V Co electronic okay what are we going to go for let me think a minute okay I got one office spaces and supplies so as I mentioned before we want to start location United States or your um your country obviously unfortunately it is not possible to have the whole world which would have been nice but you say it's a huge market and um so we are going to go with that highest number of reviews okay probably this one is I don't know I'm not from the US you might have recognized that I'm French so I don't know this company but I guess it's a huge one and that's not that interesting okay this is a well sell Market here really well uh okay HP I don't think it's interesting optimal prints okay and usually I find something in the first one um color pen that goes against what I mentioned before we want to ah this one what is that shoplet I have no idea what it is let's check it out as I said we want to check interesting well I can't because I'm not from the US that's bad let's go back uh we have this one which could be also interesting let me close that what are they doing key feature full service local de local print direct mailing first turn around okay let's put it on the side and explore a little bit more we are going to pick two companies uh level let's check this one check the website B fast easy interesting let me check that they have a fair amount of traffic 100,000 satisfied customers okay there is a market let me just check if um the reviews are recent hopefully so so we have something cool to talk about Apple 12 well that's not crazy that's not crazy but for the sake of not having a long long long video we are going to go with this one hope you don't mind okay next step uh I have my company here I just want to get to copy this or I would go back back and copy it let me open J jpt so I want to start with a new conversation then I just come here grab my prompt and PST it here something is wrong here I don't know why but this is wrong so for some for some reason I can't make it work um I don't know why so we are going to use um CL three for that here I am same thing but with a different model I have my prompt then I pass it here and normally it asks me the uh URL so I go back here copy the URL and give it to it let me just pause so you don't have to wait actually we can talk about it so we have key features here benefits um uni setting proposition sh for comp comprehensive range of label solution from blank label to custom print label um capturing divers customers needs with high quality product competitive pricing and exceptional customer service uh target audience small medium sied businesses main problem finding reliable high quality level solution and customized to specific requirements with on to buy label provides a wide range of label fast shipping and excellent customer support okay blah and then we have those Google Trend keywords so we can just open Google Trends I've talked about Google trans in my previous videos but um let me quickly introduce you to some things uh always make sure that you compare what is comparable which is search search terms are um are lot broader than um no a lot narrow than if you use um topics here for example if I would do that if I so that is a company you need to make sure you're not looking for that and that is a topic but it is too specific so let's have another another example so maybe you will understand better what I'm saying printed labels printed levels here here if I if I want to compare with this one then I need to compare with the search time because if I compare with the topic topic is a lot broader and will gather a lot more information so because I didn't have a topic here then I'm looking at the search search ter okay so no surprise here we are on the very stable but solid Market um I don't show it to you here but you can use Glimpse uh which is let me quickly show you yeah so Glimpse is a um an extension uh Chrome app that is going to um first you can find uh interesting Trends here but you can also use it with Google trans so you see the volume of search because the trans is never showing you the volume uh you can have a high TR with a small volume but Glimpse is giving you this information uh as well okay so maybe last one just to see if we see something interesting because here is basically where you can find uh something that you could like focus on product level label materials now they are quite the same sticker printing let's have a look at that ah sticker printing interesting this is something that is a little bit more in demand so what does that mean sticker printing sck oh yeah I have German websites I don't have my VPN custom stickers online here I'm just sorry I I I'm lost into research but basically what I'm doing here is just I want to understand what are the potential opportunities before I go further okay so this is a little bit different here uh see we we started with label company but then using the prompt brought us to uh something a little bit different which is sticker printing we can see that this is the same demand but this one is uh is we have a trend going up which is exactly what we want we can go with a stable Trend but if it go if it goes up it's even better and then we found a little bit of what it means tocker Printing and apparently this is something that we could pursue later okay uh I stop with that if otherwise the video will be extremely extremely long let's uh go back and have a look at the next step so we wanted to check uh Google trans we have done it and then check all the social um here you could also choose actually to to change your research and to go for the the more exciting one but for the sake of this video we are going to do just uh with this company okay I find it here too that's amazing so I check everything I guess they are not hug on Twitter oh that's okay can close that there oh interesting I wouldn't have expected that but they have traffic coming from Instagram that don't have a huge amount of followers but you can see here there is a very very good engagement the amount of like from the uh the the number of customers for a company I I can tell you it's it's huge they are doing really well on Instagram so that's something to keep in mind they are trff they have tring coming from Instagram Pinterest not huge and um what we want to do with Facebook here generally when you see a lot of followers it's either they're extremely um uh old or they're running ads so let's have a look she go about page transparency Pages not running ads okay but they were founded in 2009 and fair Advantage last thing we want to check remember is the SEO and for that uh I'm not a huge expert in SEO I just use the free tools to have a glimpse of what it means what kind of traffic do they have if you have better tools just go for it uh I think it's yeah keyword research no that's not what I want I want this one and search Let Me pause one second okay uh actually I realized I made a mistake I was on Sid audit um but I should have been on keyword research keyword overview um so this is what I just did here and we can see that there is a huge amount of organic traffic okay let's step take a step back here before we go further what do we know about this company first we know that there is kind of it's a huge Market um we have seen that on Google Trend then we see that because they have a lot of reviews although they are out there since a long time so they are probably not the only ones there there but there are also different kind of markets that we can be interested with like stickers um that could be one then we know that this company is not running ads okay this is because they are old but they are doing really well on uh Instagram which means there is kind a kind of appeal here that you can use if you do something similar uh to attract people's attention to your product uh and it works well so this is definitely something to be inspired by uh what they what are they doing exactly and we know that they have a huge traffic from SEO which is the reason why they are out there and probably the most reason why they're making money and we know yeah they don't run ads I don't remember if I said it okay uh from there already you know it gives you a bit of uh different um track to pursue but we are going to go through the next step which is find the opportunities so let's go back to our page here I'm going to just close everything and okay uh we want to sort them up by most recent and 4 three two stars only obviously it will be less recent ah yeah that's a shame that's a shame that was the reason why the the example was not that good but it doesn't matter I'm going to show you anyway uh then you can find Once ideally you have those kind of uh reviews you have them here um quite often this is when you find a big company sorry if I'm confusing here so I am just copying all that okay contrl C then I open a text block okay then second page don't have to go through the the whole pages because then it will be too long for the The Prompt so two pages are are enough but you can reproduce it several times if you want okay and then okay now I have a long list of um post reviews from customers what do I do with that uh so we have selected TRS we have sold them up by recent and copy past now it's time for the prompt so let's open uh po again and you want to be on the same conversation that you previously had so the the the AI is already aware of the company that you are um analyzing and it's important because um it is in the company in the The Prompt it refers to the company we previously analyze so you want to uh absolutely keep the same chat okay now I just pass the prompts then I open my file I copy everything and then I pass this one and let's see what it does I hope it's not too long because that's a very very long one major pinpoints labels are sometimes damaged during shipping causing printer jams don't know what's the printer jams but I guess every time so here you have the what the customer said about that um gold foil labels have issues running through laser printer smoothly okay uh FSH level up okay so those are problems remember that you probably if you would like to go for the same kind of product those are things you need to be uh really aware of and to to really be careful that you make them right potential offer improvements provide options for customers to choose shipping car on website yeah allow customer to pay custom fees uh all at once during checkout okay they have a problem with International order interesting uh product Improvement protective packaging uh add subti delation like a thin border or shade background to make Lael Edge more visible yes okay not extremely interesting this part is really if you want to create the same kind of product okay now Alternatives now it's more interesting same product focus on sub nious labels optimized for specific printer models okay don't know exactly industry specific level design food Beauty industrial so you can do the same thing but yeah exactly for you are the expert in design and and printing labels for food brands um so obviously it's more Niche more targeted and you can advertise and find clients um easily not easily easier sorry uh label unique or trending material holographic craft paper Okay small batch custom labels for et sellers crafter ah okay interesting so you there is something related with that I didn't think of that but that is a good combination already e label okay obvious uh same Market different solution custom label designed for software tools okay print at home label kits okay same Market but that's a different solution if if you want to create your label at home uh label applicator machine same thing custo customizable pre-printed label templates okay that's kind of ety business uh and level Subscription Service okay potential new solution a level design assistance okay so this is now a different business here it's a basically a SAS augmented reality label preview app why not I'm not sure I wouldn't go for that online community for sharing label design chips maybe in some niches it could be something on the you know this for example would be like what does that mean uh let's dig a little bit into that and find if there is any communities that has some label to shares to labels to share sorry on demand label printing service with 24 hours turn around so this is the kind of the same thing but with a specificity like FedEx you know you get your label right away label material sampled back for testing that's not really another solution uh potential new acquisition Channel um okay partnering with um e-commerce platform pretty tough YouTube sponsored content there were not on YouTube at least we didn't find it uh we know that there is a strong appeal a visual appeal so YouTube could be something as well as educating about uh label so they are not there that's the maybe the place to go social media contest and giveaways a referral reward program and targeted direct made catalog that's yeah why not similar Market custom packaging product tax equals business card gift level okay so now we have it we have um a bunch of different ideas for a market we starts understanding and I think if I were it's a shame I I closed it let me reopen quickly if I were to to want to create um um a product a company business in this area I would probably look into this one and go back to um to trust pilot and start my research from there see if there have something here sticker up so they have a lot of customers but they are excellent but it means they are probably there is a huge Market we have seen it on Google Trend uh then we also know that it is possible to go um on sub nishes and I would use this uh insights and ideas to kind of combine it uh into something that is new basically if we go back on the uh figma file we found something that is high demand service with an UNM expectations for specific company but it brought us to another idea another area where we can create a better offer focus on sub nishes or find new acquisition Channel that's it for this video uh I hope it gives you already a good framework to go and look for business ideas for yourself and opportunities to fill um if you are still in the process of looking for ideas market research I recommend you to watch this video which is the same principle with um different prompts that you can use different tools but for Reddit and if you are already having an idea and you want to test it out then I have this video which works you through the complete framework that you can use to to to test your business idea before you start building it and all the other parts are uh all the other videos sorry are part of these videos uh which goes much deeper on how to create the landing page using prompt so you need one hour to create the landing page uh as well as for ads campaign uh that you can create in an hour uh and so on and so forth I let you just go
