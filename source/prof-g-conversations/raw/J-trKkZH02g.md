we set up this system where you have a much you know it's the longest period of great power peace in human history um it's the greatest explosion of global economics and trading in human history the lowest number of conflicts uh in you know in human history is that all going to go away because we're going to allow a return to the Jungle of real [Music] politic fared where does this podcast find you I'm in New York at my at my house oh nice uh so let's bust right into it your new book age of revolutions progress and backlash from 1600 to the president walks The Reader through pivotal revolutions that have shaped world history the economic Revolution the French Revolution the Industrial Revolution and four present day revolutions globalization technology identity and geopolitics let's start with the past revolutions stack rank them in order of how they changed their trajectory of History what if you were going to write a book on one of them which one would it be it would be the Industrial Revolution the Industrial Revolution changed the world you can see this in a very simple graph if you look at a graph of per capita income average income of human beings in the world uh over the last 2,000 years it's basically a flatline for 1,750 of those years and then sometime around the 18th century it starts to go up and then it's like a hockey stick graph it just goes way up we go roughly speaking from a couple hundred per capita income per person to 5,000 6,000 7,000 and that dramatic rise is basically because of the Industrial Revolution so if you ask yourself what is the single thing that has changed the course of human history the most discontinuous feature of human life it is the Industrial Revolution where finally human beings were able to get themselves out of poverty out of real grinding medieval poverty and almost on a sustained basis keep raising their standards of living for 250 years but hasn't technology their technology Revolution sort of hockey sticked the hockey stick and that is what happened in those previous you know the pr the previous Century has gone parabolic I think in the last 50 years no the microprocessor vaccines um internal combustion engines hasn't it even gotten more parabolic in the last four or five decades so you know the data does not show um economic growth going parabolic in that way as you know you've seen some Optics of productivity and you've seen um rises in you know in in certainly the US for example has done very well over the last 30 years but part of it is I think that that was starting from such a low base you know you you starting with people who are barely having one meal a day uh so I think you haven't seen quite that in the data but I agree with you and that's part of what I try to explain in the book that the the nature of the digital Revolution if we can just call it that for a moment is that it has created a whole new economy and a whole new mental you know world for us uh Mark Andre's famous uh blog post where he talks about software eating the world gets it exactly right the world used to be run it was a world of atoms and what happened is the the digital Revolution came and it created a world of bits and bites that now control that those atoms so actually the internal combustion engine is is kind of irrelevant now what a car is becoming is software on Wheels and it's the software that controls that and now what's going to happen is you're going to have ai that controls the software and those things become param and and the point I'm trying to make in the book is not so much about the economic effect it's the sort of Social and psychological consequences of these changes which you know and care a lot about it is mindblowing in every way to think about that you know human beings have never had the power to multiply their minds the way that AI is going to be able to allow them to do what does that do to our conceptions of who we are as human beings and what does history tell us about there's a lot of catastrophizing around Ai and I can't I'm trying to sort through how much of his techn narcissism where people like to think that the singular the single point of failure that's going to or success that's going to destroy or save Humanity or if we should really be worried about it if as you look through history and these revolutions if we're going through an AI Revolution what can we learn from the past revolutions I share your skepticism that that it's going to like end human existence it's going to extinguish the the the universe that stuff has always struck me as you know kind of catastrophizing and you can see how it has the potential but you know human beings at the end of the day I had to put it in simple terms you can pull the plug you can create a kill switch you can create for example a simple break between the ability of AI and AI or Opera machines to access energy at the end of the day they need energy to run and so you know now you could say those kill switches become increasingly expensive uh if you're running your whole society and your whole economy and your whole cities on AI and then you suddenly say the only you know the the bre is going to be that you lose the access to energy well maybe you you then lose access to the AI That's running everything you know your planes your traffic lights everything like that but there is a kill switch the effect I think that is most likely to happen is exactly what's happened with this digital Revolution but on steroids because I do think that that that piece of this is new we until now we have always been able to use technology as a tool you know the Industrial Revolution was fundamentally an energy Revolution we were able to make machines that could do the work of thousands of humans thousands of horses that's why we talk about horsepower it was about replacing horses and a steam engine by the end could replace thousands of horses it would do was able to do the work so the AI Revolution I think allows you to replace mines it allows you to replace thousands of Mines because one computer one AI program can do what thousands of mins used to do that is mind blowing and that's the part I I'm fascinated by in terms of the potential of what it can do in terms of solving problems like disease and global warming uh but it's also kind of scary we we are entering unchartered Waters so some revolutions caused tremendous productivity some revolutions end in World War when now now do politics when you look at examining these different revolutions and looking at the state of American politics or let me go broad the state of geop politics in 2024 what lessons from history do you glean and what does it say about the situation we're in right now so the central argument of the book is every time you have these massive changes in technology and and economics propelling some societies for dramatically you get two things happen you get an identity and a political revolution the identity Revolution because you start to think of yourself differently um you know that starts with the Dutch the Dutch become the richest country in Europe but but most importantly they start to think of themselves differently they're no longer part of the Spanish Empire they're Dutch they break away they're no longer part of the Catholic world they're Protestant they break away and those identity revolutions create a political revolution that's point one and point two is you always have a backlash and what we are living through right now is the backlash to one of the most dramatic perhaps the most dramatic revolutions that we've had as you said these four revolutions uh taking place almost simultaneous iously economics in with globalization technology with information uh identity and geopolitics all happening so we are living through the the the backlash the cultural backlash to all of this how we navigate that backlash is going to determine where we end up here you know are we going to get overwhelmed by it are we going to sort of accept the the the trumps and brexits and Victor orbons of the world who say stop the train I want to get off uh the real backlash in a sense comes from Russia and China where they say and Iran to a certain extent where they're all saying we don't want any of this world we you know we believe that this Western modernity Western liberal democracy is ruining the world the Western liberal order is corrupt and they're fighting back and if for example Russia wins in Ukraine what will that do to that liberal International order that's rested on the premise that you can't you can't just take another another country's territory by force so I I don't think that there is a future out there that I can predict for you because it depends on our actions but what I the lesson I came from is I I drew from it is you are you aren't going to be able to move forward you are not going you know the forces of progress and acceleration and individual liberty don't win by themselves you know it's all going to happen naturally it's you can't be fatalistic about this and say oh time is on our side you know Steve Pinker tells me it's all going to work out in the end no you got to fight for it you've got you got to really get in there and fight back the forces of reaction and counterrevolution you write in the book that throughout history there's often a pattern of great power rivalry in which an agrarian land power is pitted against a maritime trading power uh is this still the case today it sounds like you're you're describing the the tension between China and the US am I to say more about that yes both Russia and China in some ways are fundamentally landow though China has a very large coast and you know kind of functions in both ways um and they're both launching this very spirited Campa and it's not just a geopolitical balancing one of the things that I realized when reading more and more of what Putin and she are saying it's a cultural balancing they really believe that these ideas of Western liberal democracy are destabilizing destabilizing their societies destabilizing their basis for power you know Putin goes on these rants about how you know the the the the United States is turning into the sexual fantasy land or trans rights and gay rights uh you know he came out one day in favor of JK Rowling against the people who were cancelling her xiin ping talks a lot about how he wants women back in the kitchen you know assuming their traditional roles so there's a lot of here a lot here that's about cultural reaction and cultural counterrevolution but the geopolitical piece of it is very important because they regard the liberal International order that the US has set up and and run as one where they they don't get to to do whatever they want right there are constraints There Are Rules there are norms and they're going to push they're going to keep pushing and we have to figure out do we have the uh The Willpower to fight back we have the capacity Scott if you looking at the Cold War the the Coalition against a raid against the Soviet Union comprised Say by 1970 it was about probably 40% of GDP of global GDP um today the Coalition that is supporting Ukraine against Russia is 60% of global GDP if you throw in India and a few others on the on the fence you'd get to about 70% of global GDP the question is do we have the willpower the staying power and most importantly in that regard is does the leader of the west of the of the Free World have that staying power uh um and do we want to fight that do we understand the stakes and the problem I have with Trump on International Affairs is I really don't think he understands the stakes that we are up against this challenge of what is this order that we've built since 1945 That's Unique in in human history you know nobody before that it's like the jungle of real politic for thousands of years and then we set up this system where you have a much you know it's the longest period of great power peace in human history um the greatest explosion of global economics and trading in human history the lowest number of conflicts uh in ter you know in human history is that all going to go away because we're going to allow a return to the Jungle of real politic it's interesting as you talk about pushing back and it strikes me I love what you're saying we kind of have the muscle it's the question of whether we have the mentality or the will because I was reading that as a percentage of our GDP our military spending is actually quite low relative to torically but yet just whatever it is 3% of our GDP is 800 billion which is greater than the next 10 economies combined I mean we have the resources right it it feels as if the great threat and this is a thesis and you push back or tell me that you know if America was a horror movie The call is coming from inside of the house it's that we don't like each other we can we can battle any external threat we just can't we have the muscle I'm just not sure we have the coordination or we or we're starting to self harm thises does that make any sense 100% right think about it this way Scott you know one of the points in the book is that the country that leads in technology always ends up being the dominant power so it's Netherlands in the in the 17th century it's Britain by the end of the 18th century it's the United States in the 20th century in the 21st century the United States leads in technology like it has never LED before like no country in the world has ever LED before if you look at the world of of information revolution biotech nanotech AI whatever you want the US is so far ahead in the lead those seven or eight companies that that you know are top technology companies the market cap of those companies is larger than the market cap of the entire countries of Britain France Germany and Canada put together Apple's market cap alone is larger than the stock market capitalization of the total country of Germany we make more energy than anybody in the world we make more oil than Saudi Arabia we make more natural gas than Qatar our banks are the dominant banks in the world the dollar is the dominant currency in the world and unlike any other rich country in the world we are demographically vibrant because of immigration every other rich country in the world is declining in population they're basically turning into Florida as retirement communities we are vibrant you put all that together and you say could could we handle China of course we can handle China could we handle Russia of course we could it's the problem is our our our dysfunction within you know that's taking this amazing hand of cards and making us play it badly you described the phenomena you call the rise of the rest which examines how Nations outside of the US have gained strength and confidence which nations are you paying the most attention to and and how have they kind of shifted the world order so when I wrote that book uh obviously the one I focused on most was China um which was Rising fast and I you could see that uh even then um and I talked about it as the inevitable Challenger um I think India is probably the the next most important one I know India is having a kind of moment in the Sun but it it's basically Justified uh it's because there's no other country that has the scale that China has and India has that scale and it has an incredibly vibrant economy it's growing from a very slow small base people don't right don't completely understand when they sort of talk about India as the next China so the Chinese economy is still 4 and a half times bigger than the Indian economy um and so it's India is going to have to take a take a while to catch up but it is uh on that scale but then there are you know under those two there's Indonesia there's Brazil there's Nigeria there's South Africa and the most interesting the feature of all of these uh Scott is that they're becoming politically stable and economically uh Dynamic enough that they're getting culturally and politically independent and proud so you can't boss them around anymore that's the Dilemma of the world we're in in terms of kind of management if you will it's not that there is uh you know uh a superpower that can truly rival the United States there isn't and it's not that the US has declined I mean we are still 25% of global GDP you know what we were in 1980 when Ronald Reagan was was elected 25 % of global GDP it's amazing with all this change our share of the world economy has stayed the same it's the Europeans and the Japanese that have gone down the losers but it's a world of up middle Powers if you want want to put it that way uh you know that aren't going to be taking directions from Washington and how to navigate a world like that how to Corral these countries to some collective action that that's you know that's where the skill of diplomacy becomes really important because you don't have you don't quite have the muscle you had in the past you got to use words as much as muscle stay with us the last time we spoke we spoke the week after October the 7th so it's been five months and by the way I was saying off mic the video U or the video of the podcast we did with you got I think 1.2 or 1.4 million views and I was I was ribbing you that more people watched you on this podcast than watch any CNN show which is a different talk show about how the world of media is changing but what in the last 5 months in terms of the war in Gaza what give us a sense for the state of play how it's unfolded and what has surprised you and where do you think it's headed sure so I mean in terms of these broad systemic things that we're talking about it's it's worth putting this in perspective this is largely a second order uh uh issue it's a it's it's a sideshow compared to the big forces that are shaping the world uh Israel is the dominant power in the Middle East and Will Remain the dominant power in the Middle East because it is the technologically most advanced country it is politically the mo the most potent it hasn't the military that none of these other countries can match so you put all that together and Israel is not just there to stay but it's there to be the dominant player now is it handling this this challenge appropriately my view they went from an appropriate response to an overreaction and I think I in this regard basically share the Biden administration's view that they've just gone too far uh Donald Rumsfeld used to have a rule which he said which I wish he had followed himself after the Iraq War but when he was Secretary of Defense in the war on terror he would say are we creating more terrorists than we are killing by our actions and I think about that when I think about Israel now you know it's killed about 15,000 Hamas militants by by their own by the Israeli government's own count they've killed about 30 odd thousand Palestinian civilians they've destroyed about 60% of the buildings in in uh in in Gaza and if they do Rafa it'll probably be worse because those these people have now these one and a half million people have now been displaced three times and my question is are you you know are you is it worth the next you know this last 5,000 Hamas militants given the costs you are generating in terms of the radicalization of Palestinians the radicalization of the Arab Street I don't think they've got the balance right uh right now frankly we got the bounce wrong after 9/11 so I understand it there's a lot of rage there's a lot of outrage in this particularly for Israel a feeling of um existential vulnerability that I don't think we appre sh in I mean this is a country that from the day it was founded its neighbors tried to eliminate it and then 20 years later in ' 67 tried to eliminated again and then in 1973 tried to eliminate it you know so this is not a case of being paranoid this is a case of there are real there were real enemies but a lot has changed and Israel has become very strong and the question it should be asking itself is in a world in which these moderate Arabs want to make peace with us in this world in which you know we have so much more strength than the Palestinians if you think about it before this and from the West Bank there have been no Terror attacks on Israel because that wall that Ariel Chiron built which I supported at the time it worked you know it it had just the the the incidence of West Bank terrorism went down to basically zero um and so that piece of it is I think without any question working the the challenge is what's the long-term sustainable strategy what you know where does this go in terms of a post-war settlement can you get the Arabs on board to create some kind of governing structure in Gaza and I think all that becomes harder if you're just pummeling and pummeling and pummeling and so that's my view I I I get Israel's um desire to completely eliminate uh the the Hamas as a fighting force I just think that the price you pay for those last 5,000 militants might be quite high and I'm not sure you get anything out of it because what is Hamas it's the idea of armed resistance you know if you kill them you're you're saying there aren't going to be any Palestinians who believe in armed resistance particularly after the last 6 months I'm not sure so just for the purpose of the discussion some push back and what this comes down to is what is the proportionate response to this type of attack or terrorism right and this is almost an impossible thing to calibrate um I look historically at the Japanese killed 2200 servicemen at Pearl Harbor we go on to kill 3 million Japanese including 100,000 in one night and the terms are unconditional surrender um al- Qaeda kills 2,800 Americans we go on to kill 3 to 400,000 people in Afghanistan and Iraq and the terms are unconditional surrender we killed 5 million Germans the terms are unconditional surrender when Israel is attacked at least as severely as we were in any of those instances why do they not have the same rights to demand unconditional surrender it's a great question and the fundamental reason is the Palestinians live within land that Israel controls and are going to be there for the next 100 years in other words Israel has to live with these people and has to figure out a way to live with them in a way that we didn't have to figure that out with the the Germans we didn't have to figure that out with the Japanese we didn't have to figure that out with the Taliban in Afghanistan these are all 8,000 Mi away different countries different this is the problem for the the Israelis but is that at the end of the day unless you believe there is going to be a wholesale Mass expulsion of 5 a half million Palestinians into Egypt and Jordan you got to live with these people and does it make sense to do that to do that in the context of people who technically Israel isn't in charge of right when you when you take land the people who were on that land become part part of your legal responsibility so that's to me the fundamental difference do you worry that if Hamas is left in power power there's any sort of cizire that we're just going to wash rinse and repeat that we're going to have the same I mean the people in power who uh we're calling for a ceasefire we're calling for some sort of a truce which we had October the 6 you leave him aome power um haven't they just explicitly said that they're committed to rebuilding taking whatever Aid they have and might take a year might take 10 years but doesn't this just happen again unless we figure out a way to quite frankly eliminate Hamas the way we eliminated the Third Reich or we demanded that the emperor in Japan acknowledge that he wasn't a God I mean aren't we just kicking the can down the road and as painful as it might be as much of a humanitarian crisis as it might be isn't the only solution uh to take out Hamas fully so I I am very much of the view that hamash should not govern Gaza after this and I think that I've talked to people in in inq and Egypt who have been working on talking frankly to Hamas they believe that that that is attainable that is already attainable that Hamas does not have the capacity to regain control uh in in uh in Gaza particularly if you can work out some security system post war because that that becomes the key uh unless you believe you're going to literally you know kill every last Hamas militant and there will never be another one there are going to be some SC scattered remnants of and and Scattered violent resistance right so the question is who governs Gaza and your ability to set up some kind of government of Gaza depends on the you know being able to bring in the Arabs bring in the Palestinian Authority but they're not going to be willing to come in as Israeli Stooges you know they're not going to be willing to ride on the back of Israeli tanks and govern a a a restive Palestinian population so that's that's why I think the dynamic at work that's most important to ask about is are you going to be able to get some kind of stable governance in Gaza and again that's why I think it's different Japan has been governed by by itself for 5,000 years you you knew that you know when you left Japan the Japanese would would would would be governing themselves whereas what we are trying to do as you say is prevent uh the return of Hamas and I really do believe that Hamas in that sense is an idea they can call it something else they'll call it Islamic Jihad they'll call it and some new uh term what we're trying to do is to make sure that there isn't so much radicalization in the population and in the broader neighborhood that you can get moderate Arabs to come in you can get the Palestinian Authority to come in create some structure of authority you can then pass it off to that otherwise Israel is going to be back in Gaza and we know how that movie ended it's a it's it what it takes from Israel in terms of material in terms of men you know to to run these places and what it takes in terms of the fabric of a liberal democracy to to run a you know a kind of colonial occupation is very very tough for Israel to to manage what do you think a solution might look like I mean they call you and I'm sure you get these called and they say fared what is what is what is a post truce world or a post-war gaua look like who are the my my sense of is still actually quite popular among the populace my my understanding is 7% if if anything has gotten more popular because of this you know 5 months of pummeling so you got to find some way to bring I think to bring some in some way the Palestinian Authority from the West Bank has to be a partner here you got to get the moderate Arabs involved because those are the people who are going to have credibility on the ground um you've got to create some kind of structure that gives people hope that there's rapid reconstruction of their of their houses you know a return of normaly to their lives and then I do think one you thing has come out of this whole episode which is the Israelis have always argued for a demilitarized Palestinian state if you know if those Israelis who have been willing to to talk about a two-state solution I believe that that argument becomes pretty powerful now in other words you can see why in non demilitarized Palestinian state would be an existential threat to Israel and so if you think about you know if you say to yourself look you got to have a 20-year Horizon here you're not going to solve this in a 20-year Horizon the fact that maybe you know I would argue in some ways this whole business has made um us all realize not Israel right now but you've got to find some two-state solution otherwise you're going to go on with this you know occupation forever and you can't as a democracy as a Jewish liberal democracy but you can also understand that look you can't have a normal Palestinian State because for whatever reason it is infected with enough radicalism and in in in enough violence right now that the Israeli concerns of about security have to be addressed and if you can you know if you can imagine those twin forces moving forward that you got to have a political solution but there is not going to be a normal state with a normal military that I think provides outlines for a possible solution because frankly if you had a Palestinian State and they have a flag and a national anthem and a parliament or whatever they you know they whatever however they choose to govern themselves if they don't have an army the worst thing they can do is you know some kind of a terror attack and that'll become by the way from as I said the West Bank the wall has essentially eradicated that that that threat you you can do the same thing in Gaza you can build effectively a a version of what Chiron built and Israel will be largely impregnable and in that circumstance disentangling these two peoples from their you know from this kind of joint uh ex existence is probably the in the short term the only solution I love what rock uh Robert Mamer said and the fog of war that to to defeat an enemy you just you really have to empathize with them walk in their shoes and really try and understand things from their frame and I look at the objectives of Hamas or I try to understand the objectives of Hamas on October the 6 and it was and I'll Outline Three you tell me if you agree and where this leaves us but one is killed Jews uh they accomplished that second worst day in history for for Jews uh two they I think were hoping to bring attention to their plight and I think they've accomplished that I think there's a lot of people in America who when they look closely at Israel's leadership do you know think Israel has not draped itself in glory there are huge bigots and racists on the knesset over settlements I think there is a greater understanding of an appreciation for some of the suffering of the residents of Gaza I think they've achieved that and the third thing is I think they were hoping to inspire a multi-front war to see above number one kill more Jews and that has not happened I'm curious if if if I I'm surprised or I'm I'm hopeful happy that and I think it's the function of two carry strike forces sitting offshore but I'm curious if if you agree with those three and and how they have played out yeah I agree entirely with the with those three I think you put it exactly right and I think that's why uh in some ways I think that there's a possible uh path to a solution because it has made people realize that the current situation is unsustainable both for Palestinians and Israelis the reason the third hasn't happened is is a really interesting one because what you're really referring to is the fact that at one level Hamas is part of a larger strategy of what what the Iranians call an AIS of resistance Hamas in Gaza Hezbollah in Lebanon the Iraq the Iraqi Shia militias in Iraq the Assad government uh in in Syria uh and the houis in Yemen these are all pro-iranian forces that Iran has variously encouraged and funded and in some ways this is part of that larger struggle that that we were talking about the Iranian mulas regard America and its liberal Democratic ideology as you know the kind of great cancer and they regard Israel as a Outpost of Western liberal democracy in the Middle East that's why they call the America the great Satan and they call Israel the little Satan but they are the Iranians have combined with this kind of religious ideology the old persan tradition of pragmatism and real politics so they're aware that they are facing a formidable foe in the United States and you talk to Administration officials over the years by the way and they'll say there's one thing very interesting about Iran when you push they are very cautious they don't needlessly provoke they don't needlessly get into uh you know into conflicts so if you remember that moment when the houthis fire a drone at Americans in Jordan and they killed three American servicemen that could easily have blown up and and the Iranians did everything they could to Signal a they had not authorized this B they did not intend to you know this was not a step into in in an escalatory cycle if if they had anything to do with it Hezbollah nasella the head of Hezbollah after the October 6th attack made a very interesting speech where he said you have our warm wishes you have our you know we have you have our ideological support but basically you're on your own militarily we're not going to get into this militarily so again you see this very interesting pragmatism that they have and I think your point Scott is exactly right that Biden did exactly the right thing in sending those two carrier task forces it just reminds them you know if you want to escalate this can get very messy and the US has incredible Firepower it's just incredible it's sort of what's old is new again if you look at the Battle lines in Ukraine it looks very similar to 197 and if you look at what your analogy is a really interesting one agrarian versus Naval power I've heard in almost all the biographies I've written on US presidents whenever kind of quotequote [ __ ] gets real the first question they ask is where are carriers it's still really a battle of the Seas and delivering violence and Firepower uh via VIA you know uh blue ocean waters I want to put forward a thesis and I apologize I'm digressing a bit here but I'm curious to get your thoughts I went to UCLA and I had a lot of close friends who are Iranian there was a big influx into UCLA of Iranians After the revolution and I always thought the most American kids in my fraternity were Iranians they were hardworking really into Commerce which is a Ply way of saying they're capitalist and into money generous really into education just the most American kids that I thought at UCLA that I met were Iranians and I'm one of my mentors from me mogadam I've always thought I've always held out this hope that it feels to me like Iran and the US culturally we would be great allies did that when I go to Israel I see a version of America and I always thought if I went into Iran if Iranians were like the Iranians I know here and maybe that's self- selection bias do you think there's ever a chance that Iran and the us could become allies well I think you're absolutely right about the culture Iran is a is a very worldly it's you know it's a it's a trading culture it's been a trading culture for 5,000 more modern than many Arab Nations right with respect to how it treats women very there's a bazari culture you know when I've when you I talk to people who negotiate with the Iranians they say you know you always feel like you're in the bazaar they're always scanny they're always clever about it love to trade the experience you're describing I have an even more Vivid version of that which is you know when I used to go to Egypt and Iran when I was always struck by was here you'd go to Egypt where the government was resolutely pro-american and the people hated America and then you'd go to Iran where the government hated America and the people loved America when you went when I went to Iran and you on the streets of Teran they are incredibly pro-american now this has been changed a little bit by the last 10 years of really ruinous sanctions and particularly Trump's withdrawal from the Iran deal which really meant that Iranians you know the brunt of the effect has been felt by ordinary Iranians and they blame America for it but if you go back 10 years it was amazing how pro-american the people on the street were so I think you know what we have in Iran is a counterrevolution if you put it in the terms of my book a cultural reaction you know reactionary forces that have hijacked the country for 35 years now and it's a reminder that history doesn't always move in a you know in a positive direction for the Iranians it's been going backwards for a long time can that regime break the problem is um somebody once said about about leninism when these groups come to power by Revolution they know one thing how to prevent another Revolution because they you know they're experts at Revolution and this this regime is very good at that I think they do a mixture of repression patronage and Escape valves the repression we all know the patronage is they spend a lot of money particularly in the rural areas among conservative people among older people so they they do have a kind of constituency and the Escape vals is they have an election here or there you know they do things that in some way let off steam and by doing all three they have managed to stay in power despite you know frankly so many predictions that they would leave so I I wish it were not true but I think it's going to be very hard to dislodge this regime we'll be right back in our remaining time I want to talk about domestic um Affairs and I'm terrible at sports analogies but this doesn't that won't stop me I was with my father a couple weekends ago and we used to go to Rams games which were the football team in Los Angeles and we'd always lose to the Dallas Cowboys or the Minnesota Vikings every year in the playoffs and my dad would constantly say there's nothing like the Rams to snatch de feed from the jaws of Victory and I kept thinking that when I saw him I was thinking of how he used to say that to me all the time and I thought that kind of sums up perfectly how I feel about America right now we have no reason to lose we're we're just so incredibly strong and prosperous right now and yet it feels like like that's not going to stop us quite frankly from [ __ ] it all up so if someone from the White House called you and said I'm worried we about the snatch defeat from the jaws of Victory and distinct if you want to talk about the election but I'm not I think it's bigger than Trump what what do you think are the social policies or the economic policies or just the way we approach being American that can save us from ourselves save us from snatching defeat from the jaws of Victory so look I think Biden has been a good president he has done one thing that has been really important in America we have for the last 30 or 40 years in America not had enough public investment America has been the story of America has been one of private affluence and public squalor and Biden with the infrastructure act with the IRA with the chips act all of that is an investment in America long-term investment in America and I think that that was much needed and a lot of it is going to areas which have been left behind you know I think one one calculation was 2third of the money is going to rural areas and two-thirds of the jobs being created don't require a college degree and that's that's really good and that's the right direction to go the thing that Biden is not I think understanding enough is it's not just about money it's about the sense that these people have that their world has gone away that their communities have disappeared their faith has has uh has crumbled you have to play in the cultural Arena you and and you have to play offense in the cultural Arena you can't be playing defense and I think on things like uh immigration on this whole woke uh stuff Biden has to get out there and he has to make clear that he's not with all you know all this stuff the two most successful left of center politicians in the last 30 years in in in the west were Bill Clinton and Tony Blair and they both tood that if you want to help people and you want to get your your agenda through and you want to get your ideas implemented you got to reassure people that you're not some crazy radical and it's all culture it's not economics so my favorite example of this is Bill Clinton comes out very powerfully in favor of school uniforms now the president of the United States has almost nothing to do with State education anyway it's a it's a state government issue and he has really nothing to do with what what what clothes people wear at Public Schools what he was doing was engaging in symbolic politics to tell all those people out there I'm not some crazy hippie radical you know I believe in what can be more Bourgeois what can be a more mainstream than school uniforms Blair would do similar kinds of things you know you've got to realize that people do get unsettled by all this change and they get culturally unsettled and you can't just you know you're not going to be able to bribe them you've got to engage at that cultural level Biden should make a speech against the woke agenda he should go out there and basically declare National Emergency on the border and say what you know we're not going to and let the courts challenge it that's not the point Clinton had another great line he'd say the American people don't always expect you to succeed but they want to catch you trying and Biden needs to be caught trying on some of these issues to show Americans where he is um I think if he did that it's a powerful combination you're never going to be wildly popular but if you look at some of the guys who managed to survive Justin Trudeau uh and macron they all do this they combine being kind of if you will tough on some of these cultural issues with economic opportunities for the poor yeah I'm reminded of inspired a memory of when Clinton I think he was somewhere in Michigan or Russ belt State and he said your jobs aren't coming back I'm not going to lie to you and I think he immediately got so much credit ability among moderates like well finally someone's going to be honest with us I think even the I think even the union bosses appreciated that what talk a little bit about what's happening on campuses or any thoughts you have about reform if any in higher education look I think American universities are amazing places let's not again forget the big story we we have the best universities in the world they do amazing stuff particularly in The Sciences but even other places we you know the fundamental Advantage we have over the rest of the world is other countries Singapore South Korea they teach people how to do well at tests we teach people how to think and problem solve that is a fundamentally different way of approaching education it's a deeply American way and we do it very well now I think two things have happened over the last 20 or 30 years one of them is that you have had a certain degree of the the you know the young population has been getting more leftwing for you know particularly on cultural issues and things like that and that's a real Trend that I don't pay too much attention to that in the sense that people forget in the early 1970s the Harvard Crimson was writing editorials in favor of Paul P it was writing editorials arguing that the North Vietnamese should win the Vietnam War because they were the forces of of progress and Liberation you know these are 1920 year olds you know they've often been radical they've often there were a lot of maest at Yale when I was there they're supposed to be pushing the limits right that's the idea right exactly what has changed and I think what makes it much more cancerous is this this building up of this um this diver diversity equity and inclusion apparatus and bureaucracy and I want to be clear about one thing it's not that all these people are bad many of them are very good people they're they they are right-minded they're trying to do the right thing it's a good example of incentives and institutions when you create these large bureaucracies they have a kind of self-perpetuating reason to exist and to and to grow and what that rests on is there are being problems those problems being highlighted those problems being exacerbated and one of the things I noticed on college campuses so I was at went and then I served on the board you know decades later between those two periods mid 1980s when I was at Yale and around you know 200 8 9 10 when I was when I was on the board um what had happened is you had this whole apparatus of segregation that had built up because you created you know African-American house Latin American house Hillel uh South Asian students African Americans just you created this huge apparatus of these these organizations and these administrative uh officers whose almost job it was to separate people reinforce that separation uh emphasize all the you know the problems the uh the the the you know um the the lack of uh you know the the kind of ways in which people felt discriminated and what that ended up being was it in sum total what you ended up doing was creating a more segregated more resentful more hostile campus than than was necessary uh because you're feeding these fires instead of saying we're a campus about integration you know what we really want to F is to see the commonality in all of you and I understand where you know as I say it might have been well motivated but what you have now created is a completely balkanized campus where you have these you know these groups that think of themselves as victims this bureaucracy that feeds that uh and every time they there's a problem they the demand is give us more money give us funding you know so it reinforces the segregated identities and I think this is a huge problem and it's fundamentally illiberal because we are not looking at human beings as human beings anymore we're looking at them based on ascriptive identities of race ethnicity and national origin which is fundamentally opposed to the liberal project which sees as Martin Luther King so beautifully put it judges people by the content
