# The ONE Security Tool AI Builders NEED

In this episode, Sean Kochel explores the crucial role of security in AI app development and introduces the Smp platform as an essential tool for builders to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

## Core Thesis
AI applications, especially those customized by developers, are prone to serious security vulnerabilities. Developers cannot rely solely on model providers for security assurance. Real-world examples highlight the catastrophic impact of ignoring security measures, emphasizing the need for a proactive approach using specialized tools like Smp to secure codebases and manage vulnerabilities effectively.

## Key Insights
- AI apps are vulnerable when security is neglected during the development phase.
- Developers must not disregard security, even when relying on established model providers.
- The Smp platform acts as a security engineer for AI apps, utilizing the OWASP Top 10 standards.
- Continuous security checks and real-time vulnerability assessments are vital before deployment.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Implement vulnerability scanning to identify and patch security issues in your code.
2. Familiarize yourself with the OWASP Top 10 security risks and apply these standards in your development process.
3. Avoid exposing sensitive data and enforce robust authentication and authorization practices.
4. Regularly run security scans and review vulnerabilities through tools like Smp to ensure a secure development environment.
5. Invest in a subscription plan for enhanced security features, especially for consumer-facing applications.

## Notable Quotes
> "The last thing you want to happen is that you build up to launching something... only to have your dreams shattered because you had a leaky bucket."

> "Skipping this is like knowing that someone is coming to kick you in the nads with a boot and you decide not to put on your steel reinforced protective garment."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
By integrating comprehensive security measures using reliable tools, Wilde Agency can ensure the safety and integrity of their AI products, safeguarding user trust and preventing potential vulnerabilities from compromising their technology.
