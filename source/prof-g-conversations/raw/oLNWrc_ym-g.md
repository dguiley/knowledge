when we try to convince people we usually go head to-head but let me ask you in the last 5 years how many people have you convinced deeply that they were wrong uh let's agree that not many I I worry that sometimes I come on so strong that I just end up cementing their position we think we spend an hour expressing our opinion but the other person spend an hour cementing their own beliefs Professor arieli where does this podcast find you I'm currently uh a Duke in my in my office in the center for Advance hindsight but but my mind is scattered all over the place I'm thinking about Israel I'm thinking about Gaza I'm thinking about London U I'm thinking about what's happening in American universities about Iran Syria what what's happening in South America um so the world is uh very troubling these days I I think if somebody wrote the book about this particular era that we're living in we wouldn't believe them yeah I sometimes assign it to the fact as I get older I get more anxious I was sort of sleepwalking through life from sort of 0 to 30 I think from 30 to 50 I had the right amount of anxiety I call it productive anxiety and now I'm anxious about everything but it feels these times feel especially uh anxious so it feels let let me say one one more thing about this you know I I view my world my my job as um trying to promote small improvements big improvements are tough small improvements are possible I think that within the realm of social science there's lots of opportunities for small improvements we can get people to sleep slightly better we can get people to save a bit more to fight a little Le all of those things but then these big things happen and they they take us back and you know it's it's very hard to say okay we make this small Improvement and these big step back that are how do we find the energy to to continue driving these small improvements we were speaking off Mike about how the Holocaust deniers are now merging with the October 7th deniers people who are saying are questioning whether these events ever really happened and when I and that in itself is disturbing but what I find more disturbing is when I hear these people and I see them interviewed other than the words that come out of their mouth their background their education it just doesn't fit you think these look like normal Americans that would you would expect to be rational and they're not and that's where your work kind of comes in um what it means to be irrational so let's start there give us an overview of what it means to be irrational yeah so there's there's lots of ways to be there's one way to be rational and there many ways to be irrational but but what you said is is is very true about this notion of beliefs and and you know my my latest book called misbelief exactly uh because of that and we see these people and we say to ourselves five years ago we thought that we had the same beliefs and now we look at the same people and say we don't understand how are how are they and US looking at the world in in the same way and and coming to such different conclusions and it turns out it as a psychological Machinery that gets people to a state of misbelief and as a metaphor you think you can think about the cookie and the cookie is a is a weaponized food that is designed to get us to want one and then another one and another one another one and somebody designed the cookie not intentionally to create the Obesity epidemic but somebody designed the cookie with an optimal combination of sugar fat and salt to to get this to get this behavior and we have this Machinery that gets us to believe very strange things things that you would say I I don't understand how how this happened but this this Machinery is is much more complexed in the cooking because it attracts almost all of our psychology if you look at if you look at misbelief it's basically kind of almost like an introduction to psychology textbook where it's about emotion and stress cognition personality social and all of these elements have a role in that Descent of people from having standard beliefs to having some very strange um beliefs and the basic ingredient that starts this whole path is stress and and let let's take us for a second away from from politics and and and the world around us think about two tribes of fishermen One Tribe of fishermen fishes in the deep sea one of them fishes in the lake those in the deep sea have a much more unpredictable environment those that fish in the lake much more predictable which one of them develops more superstitions the ones in the deep sea why because a Superstition gives people a sense of control I'll clap my hands I'll pray to a God I'll do this and this thing and it will give me some sense of control and it turns out that when we're stressed and I don't mean the stress of saying oh my goodness I'm so busy I'm not sure how I'll manage I mean the kind of stress that says I don't understand the world I don't understand why the cies in Yemen are all of a sudden attacking Americans I don't understand what's happening in South America I don't understand why Russia is attacking the Ukraine like I don't understand what chat GPT is going to do for my future work when when people are living in an environment and say I just don't understand the world they want a story so Superstition is one story but we want a story but we don't end there it's not just a story we want a story with the villain right because now it's not our fault it's somebody else's fault and we want a complain story and why do we want a complex story because the complex story basically gets to say I thought I don't understand how things are now I feel that I understand more than other people I understand that there's a cabal there's all kinds of things like that so people want story with the villain and the story has to be um slightly complex and that's not the end of this that's not the end of the the final of misbelief it's not the end of The Descent the with misbelief this is just a starting condition of what it starts and if you think about Co I don't know what your feeling is but my feeling is that we haven't finished even dealing with the emotional aftermath of Co um I think about kids who are now in college that spend the last two years of high school or the first two years in in in Co I think about people who are restricted worried concerned and um lost money lost faith in other people helping them like think about all of this it takes a long time to to recuperate and we haven't recuperated from covid and now we get these other Avalanches that are just making it very tough for us very tough psychologically very tough to cope I want to double click on that I I I I really I find that very interesting the notion that we become more vulnerable to conspiracy theory or misinformation or behaving around Al when we're under stress and that just makes a ton of sense to me and as a boomer I find that some of the views some of this conspiracy theory I mean it's kind of cuts across all age groups but the place I find it most surprising is with young people because they're the most educated generation in history and yet on some of the biggest issues I find that they're the most prone to misinformation or conspiracy theory so taking that one step further you know the thesis I would put forward it's it's not what's going on in Ukraine or even in the Middle East that stresses them it's what you said Co I think that's remarkably obvious I wish i' thought of that but also that the younger generation with Instagram social media bulldozer parenting my colleague and your friend Jonathan Hyde has written eloquently on this that you have the most stressed generation in arguably American history I mean maybe young people during World War II but you see all the indicators are young people are depressed and anxious I think I think you're absolutely right but there's another component of it and the component is you we've been thinking about the inputs for stress right and you were writing you write about them what's the cure against stress what's what's the remedy and and the basic remedy against this kind of stress is resilience now now think about resilience what is resilience usually we think about okay we go through life something bad happens like in my case an injury life gets really bad and then the question is do you bounce back how long it takes you and do you bounce back to where you were a little bit below a little bit above that's usually what we think about resilience as coming back from a tragedy but resilience is not just about coming back from a tragedy it's also about the way we go about our life and do we feel that if something bad happen somebody will catch us you know I think of it like an umbrella policy for everything but but not with the insurance but it's as a social contract and and and the standard uh way to think about it is what is called secure attachment right so imagine your parent you have a kid three years old you go with them to the park and you say kid go to the swing if the kid goes to the swing and come back 45 minutes minutes later you have a kid with secure attachment but if the kid goes and every two minutes they look behind their shoulder to see if you're still there you have not been so successful and that for me is the process of resilience do we think that as we go about our lives whatever we do do we think that if something bad will happen somebody will catch us and I think that that feeling is it an alltime low um how how much time do people people uh spend with their buddies how much do people spend meaningful time uh with their buddies how many how many friends do we have that we think will travel 3,000 miles and spend $20,000 to bail us out of jail not that this is the the only test of friendship but the reality is that we're getting into a situation that we have less and less resilience in society and and another interesting input is that as economic inequality increases resilience goes down why because even at the level of a neighborhood people with high income inequality in a neighborhood are less likely to ask their neighbors for help right so we are we are less together of course the the Democrat Republican separation there all kinds of other things but we're less together we feel that there's less things to Le so all of this stress is not just increasing but we have less resilience so we have less things to to defend our like our psychological immune system against stress is weaker so all of this is is creating uh lots of tension and then if you think about them so we said you know misbelief is about stress cognition emotion and social if we jump for a second to the social think about about a young person who you know hasn't heard much about Israel or Hamas or the Palestinians but they heard the the phrase from The River To The Sea and they don't necessarily know what river it is or which sea it is but but that that statement is basically a community statement for them we have these people we're marching we we are a group we're together all of a sudden it it fulfills a need it fulfills a need they they belong to something they have they have a group and you know you you you said earlier that it's not the people that you would suspect are intelligent and caring and creative and so on that's right one one of the things I learned through this journey of misbelief is that we shouldn't discount those people and we shouldn't discount their opinions and and what I mean by that it's not that they correct but those beliefs answer real needs that people have right yes we can say okay they're descending to the path of misbelief they're ending up believing in something else but what function these beliefs have why is it that that people have a need to believe that the the world is flat or the World Health Organization is doing something on their gep five what whatever it is nobody wakes up in the morning and say I want to have some misbelief today people have some deep psychological needs and they they find these misb beliefs as a as a remedy for those needs now it's not the ideal remedy but it is a remedy I I love that I I love the notion that you become more susceptible to misinformation and conspiracy theory when you're stressed and that the resilience just as you were talking about you know it's a lack of resilience I was thinking the thing that popped into my mind is it's thing that gives you resilience is deep and meaningful relationships and you articulated that you know beautifully the notion of a a kid who feels like someone is there for them and and can you know doesn't have to be in the proximity feels more resilient more trusted the the thing you didn't touch on that I wonder is part of this is that people no longer trust institutions which used to serve as a form of security any thoughts yeah absolutely so you know of course the the m trust in journalism makes it very hard to to know who to trust online uh lack of trust in politicians is lack of trust in academics and lack of trust in Physicians you know the basically basically the feeling is is that we are um on the road and and even the court system right you would want to believe that if if something happens that there is a sense of Justice out there and when the sense of justice is is eroding that's very very tough and and um one one other interesting thing about misbelief is that in my definition it has two components one component is the belief in something that is INS so okay that's the outside but the second thing is that it's a very deep belief that colors the way we view the world in general so imagine that I we'll just take the example of the the Earth is flat imagine I think that the Earth is flat it doesn't end there it says that NASA is lying and every airline pilot is lying and every government is deceiving us and every school system knows the best and the space program is a hoax and satellites and other just think about what it is and it's all of a sudden not just the belief that the Earth is flat it's a lens from which you view life and you say I don't trust any of the institutions and that's why it doesn't stop there then it goes to other things and other things and other things and then you hear a little piece here and there and you and you make the picture because if you already don't trust everything you see creates another level of mistrust and a society we're losing a lot because of can you explain the concept of solution aversion yes so so when we get when we get to the the cognitive component of how we we change our opinion there's of course a very simple component which is we watch the news that we like you you decided to watch NBC or Fox right people decide what to watch and if you watch Tik Tok Tik Tok take you to one of those path depending on their algorithm but then there's a second component which is not about select which information like imagine this is all the information you want confirmation bias is about selecting part of it I'm just going to pay attention to this I'm just paying attention to this solution verion is part of another component which says even when I get exposed to the all the information I'm able cognitively to Discount the information I don't like and focus on the things that I like so this is what is called motivated reasoning and maybe the the nicest study was done in the context of climate change and the idea is that you know if I try to to argue with somebody who is climate change denier let's say the standard strategy say here's a paper and here's another paper and here's another paper but what if it's not about the evidence these are smart intelligent people they can read what if it's about their cognitive system who says I am going to ignore this I'm going to Discount I'm not going to pay attention and solution AV verion basically says that when we don't like the proposed solution we reject the evidence so maybe what we need to do is we need to start with solutions that we might agree on and only then try to convince people so maybe not maybe but a better approach would be to say to people no if climate change was real let's talk about Solutions what would be reasonable let's come up with some and then come up with some that would not upset them that they will be willing willing to do and then and then take it from there so there's a there's another by the way interesting trick in in that regard in the cognitive regard and and we call it the illusion of explanatory depth and the illusion of explanatory depth basically says that people think they understand many things in the world but we have only a very superficial understanding and when you push people they basically realize that there's a big gap between what they think they know and what they know so so I demonstrated it with a flash toilet I said to people do you understand how a flash toilet Works said yes scale from Z to 100 stand it theot great luckily for you I have all the pieces of a flash toilet here please try and assemble it of course nobody ever managed to assemble it and I say how much do you think you understand flash toilet and people say not so much and again the idea is that when we try to convince people we usually go head-to-head but let me ask you in the last five years how many people have you convinced deeply that they were wrong uh let's agree that not many I I worry that sometimes I come on so strong that I just end up cementing their position that's right I think that's usually what happens so usually what happen is we argue with people and the the other person is not even finished listening to our sentence they're already counter arguing they already thinking why we're wrong so we think we spend an hour expressing our opinion but the other person spend an hour cementing their own beliefs so we are not convincing other people we not convince ourself the illusion of explanatory depth basically don't fight people come from their side now these Hing at people's perspective in exploring that that process and by the way another another context of course is is the war between Israel and Hamas so I I I I thankfully have lots of friends from all over the world some from Arab countries and a lot of them contacted me after October 7th wanting to to talk and I basically say look I don't want to talk about history I don't want to talk about 194 48 and 67 and so on not now I also don't want to talk about who is more morally wrong it's just not a healthy discussion I want to talk what do we do from here forward what do we think that is the right thing to do from here for and they say fine and I said what what would you like to see happen and usually people say I want an immediate ceasefire and I want Israel to leave Gaza and I say okay I can't Grant it but let's say you got this let's say you got those two what's next and usually they stop they say what do you mean what's next this is it it's over I said no no no it's not over if there's a ceasefire in Israel left Gaza does Hamas gets to rule Gaza again usually they say yes and I say do we let them arm and they say yes and I say nuclear weapon they say no and Air Force they say no er a Navy they say so I say okay so what what do we let them do and then if October 7th repeats in three months what what do you want the reaction to be done because it's it you know there's no question that something like this would would happen again and it's not that those approaches move people from right to left to left to right they just get us to the right state of being less sure in ourselves and I think one of the dangers in polarization and discussion is that too many people are 100% sure and and what we like where is the the Nuance understanding of how complex the world is and the moment you get to a a higher Nuance understanding of this is a really complex situation there's lots of wrong ways to go forward it's very unclear I think it's a it's a better reflection of the situation and it's also much more likely that we as a public we are not decision makers in in the politic but it's a make it much more likely that we as a public with uh whatever our desires to pressure the political system they would be aimed at the right at the right direction well you talk about this you talk about a means of combating misbelief requires a strategy rooted in empathy and we talked about asking questions isn't it often times also really important to acknowledge points on the other side and acknowledge the other Viewpoint acknowledge the other Viewpoint in the suffering like you know the the the the discussion is like on on both sides there were some really wonderful academic papers showing that that both Sid just want somebody to say you were wronged this was terrible this shouldn't have been like this you were wrong now let's talk about what do we do in moving forward but hearing our pain uh having some sympathy because because the other way we we just think we're fighting right couldn't you hear me here's what I just said that why why can't you acknowledge anything but people people treat discussions as if it's a battlefield it's it's not a battlefield at the end of the day uh we should come up with a with a new joint understanding of what we are and people are just not not collaborative in this process we'll be right back you speak a lot about motivation yeah you've you've written and spoken a lot about it what what gets us to care about things and act on them so so lots of things I I'll tell you this is slightly out of the context of this discussion but in the last seven years I have been tracking how companies treat their employees how the employees feel about the company and what it means for the company's performance in the stock market so for example I'll I'll ask you a few things do you think uh the companies that pay their employees better have a higher return to their stocks I'd like to think yes so the empirical answer is no not much and what about health benefits the companies that give better health benefits have higher return to their stock well I I mean I'm cheating here I know the answer is no because MC McDonald's has gone up 12x and doesn't have healthc care I mean yeah the answer is no yeah so so the reality is that there this fork in the road between extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation an intrinsic motivation is salary and bonuses and chairs and tables and health benefits and retirement benefits and all of those things that are called extrinsic motivation don't end up mattering so much this is research that we had data from 2006 ongoing so you know for this for this period and hundreds of company the things that do matter end up being about intrinsic motivation and one of the things that is the most important is do you feel appreciated now now think about what does it mean to feel appreciated way I think I think that when I heard about this when when I when when we saw the results for this I thought about all the all the waste in the world in which we just don't get people to feel sufficiently appreciated think about all the people who work with us sometimes sometimes it feels to me that people behave as if we're born with a limited amount of compliments and if we gave all of our compliments away we would die but it's not true we can give there's an endless amount of appreciation endless amount of thanks and and and it really matters people do lots of things and they want it to know that somebody is watching want to know that somebody's watching and it's and it's worthwhile another thing is psychological safety psychological safety is basically people's ability to express their opinions and it's little like resilience and and they feel that nobody would attack them nobody would cancel them nobody would attack them that it's it's a safe environment to express thoughts and and feelings alignment with the company is important right we work somewhere but but we need to know that that we're align with the company that we that we care about what it is that they are doing that we feel connected bureaucracy by the way is one of the things that kills motivation almost nothing kills motivation as much as bureaucracy because when we when we add bureaucracy we basically say to people we don't trust you we don't care about your time and we don't want you to do anything different you see a opportunity for improvement don't do it just do uh just do what's easy without uh tackling the bureaucracy of course all of those are very very negative in terms of motivation so so we have extrinsic motivation intrinsic what's really important is intrinsic and then with it intrinsic there are these two subcomponents one is Goodwill think about your current amount of efforts in quality 100 not you but you know somebody think about your your current level of effort at your job and call it the 100 now ask yourself how much lower you could get and still not lose your job many people it's quite a lot and then think about how much up you can go if you were truly excited about what you do that range between the minimum you have to do not to lose your job and the maap you could do if you could be very excited that's I call Goodwill cuz that's the part where the employee controls I decide if to sit here and drink coffee or to try very hard so that's one the first component then the second component I call utility embracing and think about the following story imagine a janitor in hospital the janitor has a job description soap water toilet paper whatever one day our Jan walks in the hallway and they hear a patient crying should they go and check on her you say yes one day the janitor walks and they see a family getting lost in the corridor should he redirect them yes in fact we understand that there's lots of things that are not in the gor's job description that we want the genitor to do we want the genitor to take the utility of the hospital this is good for the hospital it's not good for me right now because it takes time for me and I'll have to go back to my duties later but it's good for the hospital and when you think about it there are lots of cases in which we want people not to do their job description we want people to look around and say where else can I be helpful what can I do to be helpful for the organization that is not in my job description so those two components utility embracing opening our eyes and looking around and good willll make a huge difference and and the thing about it it's it's good for everybody people who go to a workplace where they love going to are healthier and more productive right everybody wins but nevertheless lots of organizations are not doing it the right way so on a larger scale what Global societal issues and I imagine there's a lot to pick from right now have occurred as a result of our own irrational Behavior what are self-inflicted wounds here well right now I think one of the big ones is is social media and it's it's multiple wounds the the class action lawsuit lawsuits in the US against tobacco about 200 billion I think something like that what would the number be if there were class action lawsuit against social media it'll be hard to quantify but but we talked about loneliness and depression and Social polarization and fake news and people are not getting vaccinated and now you can just name the name the thing imagine we would we would quantify that that would be much more I think um and it's self-inflicted in in the sense that um you know when when I when I started writing this book in The Proposal I wrote it there'll be a chapter on Solutions and I don't have a chapter on solution I have these little sections in the middle called hopefully helpful because I think that the real solutions have to be much broader and bigger we have to control social media we have to create new standards for truth I think the freedom of speech is a wonderful idea but when it can be weaponized in a way that it is now we have to reconsider it it's one of the biggest problem I think of modern society is is Miss misinformation and polarization like 10 years ago if you asked me what are the big problems facing human this wouldn't be one of them now I I think that for in order to go forward in anything we need to unite if if whatever decision we make the other half is going to say I'm not accepting it or I think this like we're not going to move forward in any meaningful way so I think that would be number one for me now is is the way that our information systems are working and we need we need to we need to do something really big to fix them Dan areli is a professor of Psych ology and behavioral economics at Duke University and a founding member of the center for advanced hindsight he's also the bestselling author of a number of books including irrationally yours predictably irrational and the upside of irrationality his latest book misbelief what makes rational people believe irrational things is out now he joins us from the great university of duke uh Professor it's always good to speak to you and uh I came late to writing books it's I wish I started earlier it's been something wonderful to me and your book uh predictably I think it was predictably irrational was motivation for me to write the book because your agent reached out to me and said you remind me of Professor arieli and you should write a book so thanks for that oh and and Jim LaVine he a he's an amazing amazing amazing guy what the M yeah exactly thanks again best of luck to you [Music] that
