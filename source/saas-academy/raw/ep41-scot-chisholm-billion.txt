how did Will frell influence the start of what went on to be an 18-year adventure for you ending an exit to GoFundMe so it's not every day will frell shows up in a startup story but uh he is in fact involved in this one there's a really common fork in the road for Tech Founders bootstrapped or to raise money that's a cautionary tale that that I'll let you that I'll let you in on my advice would be the listeners of the show all bdb software Founders I'm guessing some of these lessons were learned the hard way the thing that I struggled the most with as a Founder was you have a cool background um one so the listeners of the show all B2B software Founders and uh you have done what mini dreamed to accomplish and done it in a very interesting way um I see Will frell behind you as the inspiration of of classy so tell us tell us the story uh how did how did Will farell influence the start of what went on to be an 18-year Venture for you ending in a uh an exit to GoFundMe yeah so it's not every day will frell shows up in a startup story but uh he is in fact involved in this one so classy actually started as a uh fundraiser for cancer research uh because my mom had cancer growing up twice battled uh breast cancer chemotherapy radiation the whole bit for a while and had a a pretty big impact on you know obviously the family but me um you know kind of growing up through that and when we when I was about 24 years old I was living in San Diego with a group of friends and we decided we wanted to uh give back a little bit and do a fundraiser for cancer research and we were struggling to come up with the name for this event which ended up being a pub crawl of all things collecting cash at the door and the movie Anchor Man happened to be on in our apartment and my buddy Pete just turned to me casually and said well why don't we name the pub crawl the state classy pub crawl never in a million years thinking that it would evolve into an actual never mind a technology company but even anything but a simple fundraiser with friends and so we ended up raising some money for for the Cancer Society and that one event turned into dozens of different events um we expanded outside of Pub CS we did athletic events in 5Ks we did concerts we did all sorts of stuff all just to get young people involved in philanthropy earlier in life and to have some fun doing it you know we were all in our 20s in San Diego you know it's it's it's hard not to have fun uh in San Diego that period of your life um but we started to get a look at what technology the nonprofits were actually using to try to raise money and to try to reach a younger generation of donor because we were basically working hand inand with them and we kind of just said to ourselves one day like you know we think we could actually do this better uh than than some of the the options that are out there we had no software experience I'm a mechanical and Industrial Engineer but I I I still to this state have maybe written five lines of code in my life I was more of an artist and a designer growing up so I took more of the design um kind of angle on things but we ended up relaunching as a technology company 2011 after going through an incubator in San Diego and we dropped the stay from the name and just became classy the technology company so it has its roots with will farell we kind of redefine the word and our brand and it now ties to philanthropy which is kind of cool but little known fact will frell did do a video for our company claiming that he was the founder like as a as a spoof it was pretty hilarious because we do this we we used to do this and we still do but an in-person award show for nonprofits celebrate their impact and he he did video for us and sent it to us for the whole audience it was freaking I think it's on YouTube somewhere that is awesome that's freaking hilarious dude so cool oh that's that's great so let's D let's fast forward to the point where so there were five years where classy was um a non-te company and then in 2011 becomes a tech company there's a really common fork in the road for Tech Founders in that we either decide to be boot strapped or to raise money talk us through when were you at that intersection and what decided what caused you to decide to to go on to raise some funds yeah I mean we started with somewhat of an identity crisis and I'll explain um we we we kind of our first Fork even before raising money was like who do we want to be when we grow up who do we want to be when we grow up um is it a BTO C company kind of like it that existed at the time Kickstarter Indiegogo later GoFundMe and really work on fundraising for individual causes or do we want to be a B2B SAS company or do we want to try to do both and we ended up um deciding very strongly to go down the B2B path because we had read this book as a group uh good to Great by Jim Collins you're probably familiar and in there he says what can you be best in the world at and that that actually like really hit us hard and we said okay what we can be best in the world at is working with nonprofits and helping them because we've been doing events for them in the trenches essentially for the last you know five four or five years so we have a unique Advantage down that path versus becoming a b Toc company and competing with the likes of Kickstarter etc etc so we we at the time we kind of were doing a little bit of both so we we we um essentially got rid of the B Toc side doubled down on the B2B side and that's when things started really to take off with the business and we started to realize well wait a second here like maybe um people would be interested in this as like an awesome business opportunity um and so that really gave us the confidence to to even think about raising money from investors but we still bootstrapped for quite a while we actually bootstrapped for the first several years uh eventually raising only from Angel Investors and we raised the first $5 million from all Angel Investors and primarily from three super Angels who at the time we didn't call Super Angels but they basically invested say 100K and then they just kept seeing the traction of the company and we would they would just reup and that was awesome it was very difficult to to obviously find them uh at first but once we did it was almost like we had sort of these like really bought in Partners if you will that had all been successful in their prior life and business but knew something about the charity space and that's actually what made it really difficult for us to raise money from institutions later they just didn't understand the charity space they thought we were a charity they didn't understand the like how you could you know do you know make a make a really positive impact but also be a money-making Venture at the same time like this was all fairly new and this was around 2011 to 2014 so it doesn't seem that long ago but this was before the BP movement this is before the word like sort of social Enterprise was was welln and we kind of pitched ourselves as a as a as a hybrid uh a company that could could be a great business opportunity but also do good um while doing so uh almost like Patagonia in a different space and that eventually started to catch on but really what got us on the radar of institutional money was our partnership with Salesforce so we had done a integration with Salesforce CRM that allowed classy's fundraising platform to connect to the nonprofit version of their sales Cloud essentially and they had identified nonprofit and higher ed as a as a really large growth opportunity for them and so their Venture um Team basically came knocking one day and said hey you know we see that you've built an integration with Salesforce we're interested in this vertical seems like you're getting a lot of traction and you guys are sort of starting to become um you know starting to get some momentum and become a leader um we're interested in investing and so that was very small check in the beginning uh was at 500k that expanded over time but that gave us the credibility uh you know as a as a company but also sort of in our space and an industry and a market that VC's might be interested in to have the next couple conversations totally this is a this journey played out over I mean that was like five years it wasn't like we woke up and we're like let's just go raise VC it was more let's bootstrap then let's raise money you know $25,000 at a time kind of thing on a convertible note from all Angels the smallest check We Ever Raised was from my now wife which was $7500 that I I asked her to invest on a date she good thing things worked out um but later on you know the the institutional money was was much smaller than the rounds today it was you know million and a half two million for the first you know sort of series a and then we eventually raised uh bigger money an $18 million round from mithal Capital which is Peter Teal's other fund outside of Founders fund um and then we did a series C and D um with the the lead Norwest Venture Partners So eventually we got into that more classical raise a large round kind of motion but it was a long time getting there and it was it was it was something where we felt we needed the capital to compete I believe in today's world uh things are different and if I were to start classy over again I probably would have been even more Capital efficient I think you can do more with less these days but we we felt that because the the the the space was old but it was a little bit crowded like a lot of older smaller players and it was hard to break through the noise as a as a as a new guy we felt brute force was the way to do it to just push through that and it worked it worked could we have saved a little bit more of the company in the earlier days yeah sure but at the end of the day it ended up being a big company and it was it was a home run bet from day one um again if I was to do it again I'd probably like aim for a double or triple and maybe hope for the Home Run not necessarily put everything all the eggs in one basket and just like you know everything on black type of thing but that's kind of how classy was from day one that I I love that and I love that you referenced Patagonia I think his name is yvon he wrote the book uh let my people go surfing and in there he tells a story about having to lay off about 150 of his team members at a time when the company was really small and he said the lesson he learned in that phase of his entrepreneurial Journey was he never wanted to build a business that was dependent upon growth Y and so they had to be they had to they had to acquire enough inventory so they made a huge bet and it they had to grow the next season in order to keep the employees they had and I think that the one of the things we coach on hard at SAS Academy is making sure that you're running a SAS business that doesn't need the next round of investment to make sure that the uni economics at every stage of the business can continue to support the strategy it can be an accelerant and in many scenarios it helps like being able to choose the Brute Force growth strategy for classy like you're saying now you I've got more education more experience I know now I have more tools you like for it's okay if it's an option we don't want it to be the only option um so I love hearing uh that true to In your experience I'm curious what would you do differently now if if you're a Founder what should someone know if they're raising money in 2024 or thinking about it they're running a Sal company what's different you're now on the investment side I think you have this unique perspective of seeing both what should a Founder know about raising money in 2024 I would just punt the decision as long as you can I I I think that it's a decision for later I think everyone should start bootstrapped I think it it it creates the right discipline creates the right focus in a way that being bloated with extra cash does not um I look back on the early days of classy because remember it was very difficult for us to raise anything so we really didn't have a lot of money um for many many years and that kept us laser focus it forced us to make that decision like we're talking about with Jim Colin's good to Great like we we if we had had $5 million in the bank when we were making that decision we might have decided to do both B Toc and B2B and tried to be everything and there were actually competitors that had raised big rounds from Silicon Valley um I I don't know if the listeners would know these companies but rally and fley who are no longer with us today but they had the quote unquote mind share of the valley because they had re they had raised large rounds so we always saw ourselves as a huge Underdog because we were down in San Diego we weren't in Silicon Valley we didn't raise large rounds initially um but it ended up being our biggest strength and and guess who kept standing you know through all of that like little old classy little old the The Little Engine That Could and I think that story tends to play out more than people realize it's the folks that are actually have either um you know designed constraints into the business or just have constraints that they work with because it forces creativity it forces discipline it forus uh forces Focus so I would my advice would be stay bootstrap as long as you can once you are at product Market fit and once you have shown that you have a repeatable sales model that's when I think it's a really interesting uh question to ask to pose you know would it make sense to raise money at that point to accelerate the growth or or and take some money off the table as a Founder because that's something that we didn't do until more later rounds and it was one of the smartest things we ever did just just a small amount so that you're not just stressed like through your you know up to your eyeballs and um you can create a little bit of cushion for you and your family but you're still super incentivized you're still motivated you still own the majority of the company in no round we did we never gave away the majority we always had balance control that's another thing that I would always make sure that it's front and center don't chase valuation make sure that you're chasing um good terms and make sure that you retain um what I would say control but balance control um but really I don't think you need to raise money unless you really see an opportunity to accelerate I think the longer you can stay bootstrapped the better um but if you see a moment in time where it's like you know you know exactly where you're going you have Clarity and you have a repeatable sales model it might make sense to do that yeah but I think you push that out as long as you can get the cultural get the culture right get the company and business model right then do it the folks that really strug are the folks that raise a lot of money too early they don't have the business model dialed in they don't have the culture really the set the they don't have the foundation of the culture set and guess what happens like they they the thing breaks in half um and you can you there is such a thing as as breaking under your own weight you know and if you have too much money and you're gr too fast and you haven't set those those fundamentals correctly like it's not a good place to be yeah it really is an accelerant if you don't know the direction it will only accelerate your uh you're almost going too fast to work through the state of ambiguity in the business like I love that you put it after let's define the culture let's define who we want to be let's let's find product Market fit then we go raise talk to me about the evolution of Scott the founder through that phase like dude it's totally different to be you know young you know founder uh running fundraising events in San Diego it's now running a venture-backed software company managing all the way up to I think it its height 300 employees so talk to me about the evolution uh of what it took of your leadership to take the company through that process yeah I mean in the in the earliest days it was a passion project and I think that's helpful because it helps connect your personal why to the mission more um which is good because that helps you get through the ups and downs so I think that was fundamental I'm glad we had those formative years prior to being a tech company where we were just getting super deep into like why are we doing this in the first place what's our motivation here um and I really do think that that was extremely helpful it was like the longest period ever of like customer development you know what I mean because we're getting to know the space getting to know the nonprofits understanding the fundraising market then we launched a product you know so it's very organic um so I think that was very helpful Foundation um once we got going as a tech uh company you know I had never you I was technical but I wasn't a software engineer so we needed to round out the team the co-founders were essential one of them came from the prior events days and then we added two additional um more technical co-founders to the team which was which was huge but we stayed about 20ish 20ish or so people for quite a while through that whole bootstrapping and early fundraising piece um and you know I was the CEO from inception I like to say accidentally because I was the one who went to the lawyer office and got the corporate paperwork so I became the CEO but that's how these things happen luckily my co-founders were very supportive of that decision they saw something in me and they were always there to get my back even through the worst times we had and so I I do think that the the co-founder relationship is so vital it's why whyc combinator uh screens for co-founder relationships and it's not because the co-founder or the founder themselves are such a great CEO such a great product lead or such a great salesperson it's because um when you're about to quit the the leader or the co-founder the other person helped them you know walk them walks them off the ledge right like convinces them to keep going and that alone is the difference between success and failure a lot of times it's not even the functional expertise or any of that [ __ ] um so to for me the co-founders is like a support group um and yeah you're going to get mad at each other is going to be bad days but really making sure that relationship um you know persists and you work on it is is so fundamental to scaling and having the right support system around you so for me I would just I literally just consumed everything I could from uh ivonne's book let my people go surfing all the way to other operational books like Kut management is another one of my favorites of course the Lean Startup at the time you know I would consume SAS blogs like David sc's blog like Lin who was just getting started like all of it I mean podcasts weren't as much of a thing but I just consumed as much as I could and I became a student of SAS really like I I really wanted to become one of the best at understanding SAS business models and how that applied to my industry I would go way outside the nonprofit space frankly I would look everywhere but the nonprofit space A lot of times just to learn as much as I could and then I would always have this attitude like I needed to earn my stripes as a CEO there's a difference between the founder being a Founder which is a permanent quote unquote position and actually not really a position it's just a starting point and the CEO role so I never took the CEO role for granted just because I was the founder doesn't mean that I automatically deserve to be the CEO and I always had that attitude because it forces you to have this always be learning mindset when I say earn my stripes it's like every phase of growth has a new criteria for excellence not only the company but you as the leader and you have to be ahead of the company a lot of times in your personal development so earn your stripes motto internally at Classy was no one is guaranteed a position the position is going to change and you have to continue to earn and learn that position over time could you make it all the way to an IPO possibly not a lot of people do but I'm bet I'm rooting for you including myself right like that's the attitude nothing's guaranteed we're all in this together we're all learning and if you might not even like the position you end up you might end up in later like I like I could have opted out and been like you know I'm more of a 50 person and under CEO but now I don't it's not for me and that happens a lot I I kept going and I I felt confident I I kept growing into my own shoes and confidence kind of but there were other co-founders that ended up leading a decent sized team that was like you know what I actually just want to be an individual contributor and we had the culture where that was okay they were able to raise their hand and come to me and say you know this I know you said we got to earn our Stripes I've gotten this far I don't want to leave the company though can is there another position for me and I would always do whatever I could to create another position or to put that person in another valuable role based on where we were headed and then bring in a leader either sometimes on top of them or they would roll to me or whatever the design was but the fact that they had the courage to and and we had such the the transparent relationship where they would raise their hand and say that and it wasn't bottled up for years which is which is totally common um I think that's one of the proudest things about the whole journey was just creating that that type of culture with my co-founders who started off as friends to be honest they always say don't do business with friends right um so we broke all the rules um but it was because we had that trusting relationship and we were transparent with each other that I think we we were able to get through it but you know there were terrible times there were times where we wanted to kill each other I mean sure those those times happen but we put the company first and I think that's so critical we we we we we because we had this like earn your stripes mentality we were able to put our egos aside and then force ourselves to the table and get through those moments where some people just call it quits at that point they're like I'm just done with I cannot deal with this person and these interpersonal Dynamics tend to be the reasons why a lot of people quit not even the product the market the traction it's literally they just can't handle the interpersonal Dynamics with their co-founder or other Executives or they feel like they've been forced into a leadership position and they just aren't comfortable doing it so to anyone listening I just just always when you're starting out when you're smaller when these things don't aren't really a big deal talk about them and just say look this is what's this is what other people that have gone through this have said it's not going to be the same we some of us might hit a ceiling at some point and then bust through that ceiling maybe they bust through in a different position we just have to be flexible with each other to say yeah the exact scenario and where we're all in these seats now are not necessarily going to be the seats later and that's okay we just got it's about the company and we're going to do whatever we can to make the company successful yeah Scott we talk about this a lot at a theoretical level I'm curious to get your take on it tactically if you say let's just say that step one is as a CEO making that unnown dynamic in the company there are some of us that will make it through multiple phases of growth and some of us will hit our ceilings whose responsibility is it to to you is that is that it for the CEO you you youve said hey as long as I've named this as a dynamic now it's on me to hold the bar and it's on the individual contributors or the managers just the the team members to recognize that and then drive their own growth or is there more responsibility just in your opinion as a CEO to support the growth from one phase to another if so like what does that look like yeah that's a great question I think for us it was so important that we put some of this into our actual core values for example um adapt and overcome is the is the resilience piece um always be learning to try to drive a learning culture and and and what that means right um standing for something which is the Patagonia side so so some of these themes that we've talked about we actually made core values into the company and that sort of like like codifies it in in a way on a day-to-day basis but yeah it has to sort of the whole the whole idea is like the whole a of earning your stripes and the seat you're in now might not be the seat you're in in the future that just has to be led by the CEO and repeated and then eventually your people team your HR department they have to be educated on that too and you have to make sure that when someone shows up in one of those conversations they have that same attitude there needs to be consistency from what the CEO is saying into those Performance Management conversations the career conversations and you truly need to work with the person you can't just be like oh cool you you know you don't feel like you're a leader you're fired you know what I mean like you to actually practice what you preach but it starts at the top two I think it's a values based thing and those values trickle into Performance Management and how you actually design the people in the HR function of the company Long Term yeah yeah I love it so let's uh let's go back to the The Classy story you how did you know exiting a company can be a really scary time for a Founder um for many it's such a final decision and a lot you mean you worked on this thing for 11 years the there's so much unknowns around around what's it look like on the other side can you how did that conversation get started yeah and it's funny we we we we quote unquote sold the company um and I'll explain why I put that in quotes in a sec at the weirdest time because we had just raised a series def financing 118 million we we raised a big portion of that was secondary so we were we were returning some money to shareholders which was awesome after so many years um and it relieved some pressure in terms of liquidity so we were like set to go and gami came knocking actually for the third time uh and it was it the fact that they actually approached us right in a posi when we were in a position of strength was very interesting because that typically is not what happens and so it meant that they were really really serious this time and they had changed their they had they had a new CEO they had changed some some of the executives and um we had some really great early conversations but this is a story that started with the founding teams years before that gofam actually was founded in San Diego alongside classy we were totally two different businesses but we used to actually help each other and collaborate on various things from like what's the best payments software to use for our payments platform to use for the back end or you know we pitched PayPal one time to build um split and chain payments which weren't a thing and all these different things these stories along the way Brad and Andy and myself and Pat Marshall we became good friends so we always joked actually wouldn't it be funny if the companies came together someday like that would be kind of awesome you'd have like the consumer side and the B2B side now that would be a forced to be reckoned with like hahaa you know and we would go along our merry way and then later down the road like they they approached us a couple times inquiring and it just didn't make sense for where we were at we just had more things to prove more things to figure out um and then this this last time that they came really it was it was about the potential of both companies um and this this this deal actually involved quite a bit of stock so it wasn't just all cash we're all gone you know all the classy people just you know kind of go their merry way this was actually a combo and it it it it is something where the story is continuing but we're just as part of the GoFundMe team um which is different and unique and I think that's important for why we made the decision all of the shareholder base got to participate in the future story in some in one way or another and that really was huge because we had just done the series D we had relieved some cash pressure to the shareholders and this unique opportunity comes along and we basically said we think we're better together it was one of those it was like it was but this been this story this joke ha had been going on for nine years between the founders and then the new CEO came in someone must have said something about their past interaction and he got really into the idea and they brought a business case forward that was compelling and we brought it to the board and we're like you know what this makes a lot of [ __ ] sense and really just for the listeners like the rationale is you have you have hundred million plus people people coming to gofam from around the world gofam in a lot of different countries that classy not and they're all coming to look or donate to individual causes and if someone comes to an individual cause let's say you know you're you know someone in an extended friend or family has cancer so you go to that individual campaign you donate well wouldn't you as a donor who just donated to the cause of cancer maybe be interested in a couple nonprofit organizations that are working on the cure for cancer or that specific type of cancer and so classy can come in and recommend those nonprofits to the donors so really it becomes a Marketplace and both classy and um uh both classy and gami together are now the biggest giving platform in the world and we've raised over 30 billion dollars for individual and nonprofit causes since we were founded and and we're picking up steam like it's starting to it took I mean it's been about year and a half two years since the actual um acquisition merger and we're just now starting to see the really cool synergies that everyone dreamt so it's incredibly exciting time for everyone at the company um and we're starting to really I think add unique synergetic value to the donors and the nonprofits in a way that no other platform in the world can do and that was the idea that was the appeal so we said look this if we're if we're talking about building a multi- deade long company that that survives Beyond any of us and adds value to the world this is the way to do it and that was really the rationale of the of the acquisition man so cool so you guys had talked prior to GoFundMe coming and knocking you said hey you know was was the was the default plan this is gonna IPO one day after series D or did you have a list of hey there's if if there was someone that was an acquisition made sense we had a short list of strategics that we would be like yeah that would be this feels like it would be a 10 out of 10 outcome yeah the the the really the only two that I ever had in mind outside of our own independent path which was the primary plan a um was GoFundMe and Salesforce and Salesforce for a different reason Salesforce took a little bit of their foot off the break on the nonprofit higher ed vertical and so go and GoFundMe came knocking at a unique time I would say the upside for the company over multi like almost a generation multi- decades that is a larger opportunity with GoFundMe um in terms of just like great outcome immediately for the for the for the team and everyone else the Salesforce would have been different would have been a different type of deal um but you know we felt like we're we always were building a 100y yard long company this was the way to do it it was either basically go public or do this gofam deal and so we chose to do the gofam deal and the future is bright with the company there's no set plans to become a public company necessarily where everyone's taking their time but it has the characteristics to be one someday um or it could stay private for a long time I mean we talked about Patagonia several times on this on the Pod so far like that's actually a model company they've been a private a company for a long time um not because they don't they have anything to hide just look at anything he says right like they they just prefer it because they are able to block the company from activist investors all sorts of different weird dynamics that play out as an as a public company and they feel like they can fulfill their mission better um we're not necessarily antio it's more just let's let's just grow an awesome company and see what happens so the deal and the merger was able to take some pressure off of that timeline which is actually a great thing yeah I love it man you're you're a great illustration of if we we we serve Founders and help them find their perfect exit and there's a few things that are prerequisites to that that all true in your story the first one is we got to build a business that is a good one to sell is a good one to run right so we got have really strong economics so that way when the opportunity comes our way we're operating from a position of strength the second one is uh to have a list of dream buyers you have a really good your constraints breed crazy ity they also just help you know use a really powerful tool of what is no so all those like I'm sure you're getting inquiry after inquiry especially as classy starts to build momentum all you know a lot a lot easier to raise Investments you know later down the road once once it's been proven out so you got to get a really good filter for what is in what's a immediate yes and what's an immediate no uh man you're just a great illustration of some of those all of the the foundational pieces put in place to be able to create an exit um like you did at at kasu so I'm really really curious um we use exit as you know I know you're still continuing to be involved and there's a lot more work to be done um but I'm really curious the money hits a bank account the the new chapter begins like what do you think what's the next thing you do well I I had actually transitioned from CEO to Chairman not that long before that it was part of the series D deal so it was a little bit cleaner for me because I sort of had already I've been doing it for 10 years I already knew that 10 the 10e Mark was kind of my time to move into like more of a chairman position um so for me it wasn't as drastic I already had a succession plan I already was like kind of phasing into that next phase uh phasing into that next role if you will um so it was less drastic for me I think I think you know when you when you are acquired um even if you do own stock in the the company that is that is required you you lose a lot of control and so you have to get used to that right like you have to kind of trust the the management team the the board of directors to have everyone's best interest in mind and and that has played out to be true but I know there's a lot of scenarios where someone gets you know acquired by a company and that isn't the case um and they're not treated very well or they're not integrated correctly or or what was promised on the front end doesn't actually end up materializing for their product and that I can see how that would be devastating um quite honestly unless you just did an all cash deal and you just you know sailed away into wherever right but this was more of a partnership SL merger it was an acquisition formally but it was really a partnership um and the integration part and realizing this vision is is still crucial um but to go F's credit you know they've they've done it in a in a really respectful and delicate way not just to our team but to our customers um and I think that we just starting to see the fruits of all of that work and labor now so I'm incredibly excited but for me I took a step back operationally I was already part of that process was was already happening um I play more of a strategic advisor role to the executive team to the CEO to my successor at Classy who's now also the COO of GoFundMe so I I'm talking to them weekly which is cool but it's more on an ad hoc basis I'm not like you know I don't have to sit in on all the executive meetings and all that stuff it's it really is a dream position right now I don't know how long it'll last it might kick me out or or or you know get sick of me but it's it's awesome because they call me when they want to and I can add real strategic advice about the market about the product about where we're headed um sometimes I'll sit in on strategy like offsites things like that but typically it's more ad hoc um and I'm I'm inv I purposely chose not to be on the board as part of the deal I just wanted a really a clean break um but I still even advise some of the board members as well so uh I'm pretty involved but I'm able to start other projects which is kind of The Best of Both Worlds um and I I'm now coaching Founders as well through a program called Highland that's been really rewarding it's got me back in the trenches in a different way which is kind of neat and I'm able to share all the ups and downs and and and twists and turns and experience that I've gotten from The Classy journey and I'm bringing in other guests other successful entrepreneurs to contribute uh in that way too similar to how you guys do it um at SAS Academy I love it I think uh let's let's turn our Focus there so uh one of the Promises of Highland is to help Founders go from Founders to CEOs we talked a little bit about the difference there but why don't you expand on that what is the difference and what's the transformation you help Founders create in their businesses yeah so being a founder or founding something is inherently a building role you know you're you're building a product and then you're trying to get it into the hands of customers it's very Scrappy you're doing all roles you know you're you're you're basically the you're critical to decisions um you work pretty much around the clock you're available to your team anytime and all that's necessary I mean it's literally a life or death thing until you get to product Market fit and really into like initial scale like you you've got a repeatable thing people want the product that you're selling you've sort of dialed in price there's so much calibration that needs to go into that first couple phases that you need to be Hands-On like I call that build mode and that's really inherent to a founder and they they a lot of times they they it's very natural just comes natural to them then you hit a point where the company needs you to work on the organization more than the product itself and needs to be scaled you now have a product that someone uh wants or a group of people want that isn't like your mom and your uncle it's like actual strangers that want this thing so now you got to figure out how to scale it how to build a repeatable uh sales and marketing process how to grow and build the organization and the culture in the right way and everything in between there's a lot in there I call that scale mode and most Founders have a real hard time transitioning from build mode to scale mode or founder to CEO and mainly because they're really good at build mode they they like it it's fun you know what I mean like it's something they're good at they've never been trained how to be a see a proper CEO or scale themselves alongside scaling the business and so what ends up happening is they become the bottleneck and the business stagnates because of them and their leadership and that's a super unfortunate thing they might have the biggest Market in the world and a great product but because they can't get out of the way they actually hold the company back often times it isn't 100% self-identified those those cases um but they do come to me in Highland and say hey I I you know I know the potentials here I see the signals but I just don't know how to build the organization in the right way and I don't know how to like scale myself so there's enough self-awareness where they're like coming in kind of knowing something needs to change and I basically say I show them the chart I'm like okay here are all the things you're probably doing here are the things you need to be doing most some people are stuck completely in build mode but most commonly they have one foot in build mode one foot in scale mode and they're flip-flopping back and forth and they're they're building some parts of the organization correctly but not all the parts um and so they become you know a weak point or a bottleneck and so I help them figure that out I help them see that and we help them uh we teach them how to build the right uh infrastructure essentially in operating system to go from roughly about a million in Revenue which is where most Founders are at some smaller um to tens of millions of dollars um in Revenue really we we help them lay down the the framework and the and the foundation to get well well past 100 million using the same principles yeah I love it it's it's really interesting we we commonly refer to this as I use three million as the proxy most businesses when they get to 3 million and revenue you're well into this Dynamic and that is that you're leading through leaders so your value the thing that makes you feel productive has to change from the work product you produce the decisions and outcomes you create to the ones you create through your team through other people right and that is such a different it's like almost like there takes so much discipline to go do that especially if you've been the leader in every function like oh my God how hard is it to watch a sales leader take on a sales organization when you've been doing founder Le sales for years if you have a down month what's the founder want to do throw on the sales strap on the cape and get into the trenches how have you it sounds like you're you're Focus exclusively on this challenge as well what are some of the is it just like by pure pain you have to realize you just like you made the GS business go sideways for long enough to to then raise your hand and decide to to move on like how do you help a Founder get to the point of realization that they really do need to show up differently in the business and like what are you calling them towards tactically I think one thing understand it theoretically they can probably point to the shrapnel they created in their businesses based on having strapped on the cape and and uh and jump in the trenes but what do you call them two yeah I mean they're they're they're basically breaking in half you know what I mean like it's it's it's like you said it could be that the business stagnates um that there's a lot of like pain and they're you know going back into the weeds um but really they're they're stressed beyond belief like they they they know in their heart that this is not sustainable like they this is just in Sprint mode and build mode um and they really need to figure out how to you know get themselves out of the weeds and build a real team um so first is the team right like what team do you have around you um and what are the functions that you're way too deep in right now for your scale how can we reorganize that particular team how do you get a leader how do you build a real leadership team what ises that what do those people look like what are the characteristics that you should you should hire for um and then it's working on the organization itself part partly to attract those leaders but just partly to set up their success and that starts with absolute Clarity Vision you know you revisit the mission the V vision and the values and the goals of the organization and oftentimes that that gets worked on earlier and then set aside because you're just fighting fires for for a while but it's the perfect moment around this time like post product Market fit initial scale to revisit all of that stuff and make sure that you you're providing absolute Clarity directional Clarity to your entire team uh in you know three to fiveyear window down to the year down to the quarter down to the month That's essential and that's the CEO's job eventually a COO or chief of staff will assist with those things but it's the CEO's job to lay the framework lay the operating system where all this is very clear to everyone and it it really forces Focus across the organization that's truly critical and if you can dial that in then it's really attractive for people coming into the company they're like oh wow this is dialed in you know this doesn't this isn't a [ __ ] show like the CEO has laid the right foundation me as an experienced executive maybe running sales can now come in and go oh it's a real organization like I he this person is he or she the CEO knows what they're doing um I see where we're going so it's it's it's just as much a recruiting tool as it is anything else which is kind of awesome um and then it's about like the the the other infrastructural components um the operational Rhythm you know how are you conducting the company on a annual quarterly and monthly basis and that starts with everything from your annual kickoff all the way down to the more granular in a one-on-one meeting with anyone that's on your team and how do you do all those meetings correctly efficiently and how do you place them and sequence them throughout the year so everyone has sort of a reliable Rhythm that they know and can count on but then how do you also not provide so how do you make it not how do you how do you not um uh provide too much structure where it's too rigid and you you sort of Zap the creativity and the autonomy out of the organization there is a fine line there so that's a huge piece of it right so to kind of summarize it's it's you know the Personnel on the team it's the clarity and the directional like where are we all going together and it's the operational system or Rhythm that you need to lay and those three things combined are really in my opinion the the CEO's job to lead and that I mean that gives them enough to do right like if you say these are the things you need to focus on when are they going to have time to jump into the weeds of product again you know what I mean like they're like holy crap like that's what a CEO does you know at this level so there is a really eye Awakening thing and then they start to roll it out and they see the tremendous benefit and they start to see how these items are actually extremely high leverage so if they get them right then everyone starts adopting them they don't need to be in the room all the time in the more anymore it's all about building self-managing teams over time teams that can operate and be successful without you there and that's what this starts to do you know identity is such a drive of how we show up in our businesses how we see ourselves and so it's one thing to understand tactically what to do it's another thing to really evolve the identity into the identity of how we how we view ourselves in the business how we you know what our self worth is is based on how often do you find that being the ceiling for someone creating this transformation versus you can learn the skill sets but it's another thing to to actually live it out um have you found an effective tool for transitioning that identity to someone who shows up and is the Visionary attracts top talent leads through other people so I think I think more Founders have it in them than they realize that's kind of my personal belief they just haven't been taught what they're supposed to how their role is supposed to evolve so it's tough to go somewhere where you don't know where you're going or what it's supposed to look like you know and what's ironic is you know going back to like VCS and advisors and stuff like that there's a lot of great Operational Support that VCS give their companies from product to s or to sales to marketing but they don't actually have in-house executive training programs for the C for the founder to transition to CEO which is kind of nuts yeah so they they just like assume that the founder is going to figure that out when that's like that's probably the most critical point within the organization and certainly can become the biggest bottleneck but when I'm working with someone to go from build mode to scale mode honestly like when they see what's on the other side when they see that role they'll either opt in or opt out most opt in but once they can see what that entails they some will say I'm not sure I want I'm not sure I'm that person I'm not sure I have the skills my job is to show them and to encourage them to at least try and not just self- select out before they know that they can actually develop into that because honestly I'm I'm a big believer in in founder-led companies for as long as possible um but they need to be trained they need to know what they're getting themselves into and they need to earn their stripes they they they it's not just like you don't just wear the role of CEO just because you put it on your business card you you have to develop into one but in my opinion the board of directors or the investors in the company need to support that Co in that transition and if you're completely B bootstrapped and you don't have those things then you need to seek them out you need to be self aware enough to know that Founders doesn't equate to Great CEO at scale and you need find advisers found those resour our es um find things like Zas Academy or Highland to help you in that development um but it is a really it's a it's a really interesting inflection point for the company and the leader most often the Highland the people that are in Highland will say you know what this makes sense and I can do that and they'll get it there'll be like 10% that say I'd rather just lead product but I'm gonna go find a CEO now or I think that's actually the role for my co-founder you know it's really interesting how they just immediately they're like oh oh I get it now isn't so mysterious like yeah I get what's needed from one million to 50 million or 100 million and and then they they can be in control of that decision it's not something that's imposed upon them mysteriously like you know you're doing such a bad job Mr founder CEO and you're like I I you know I thought I was doing the right things but no one ever taught me what the what what those were right so I think it's a really like I think it's a moment of where the weight is lifted off their shoulder they see what they need to go do and they can they can be in control of that decision to say hey yeah I got that in me I think that's me or not and that's fine because it's about the company man Scott I think that what you're doing at Highland is such a valuable just a gift back I mean you could do all kinds of things with your time it's it's one thing to learn these things conceptually it's another thing to be speaking to someone who's been there and done that you speak with some lived experience um I'm I'm guessing some of these lessons were learned the hard way was there a hard ear lesson in what you know in this transition for you at Classy that it allows you to speak from that level of experience yeah I mean there there's there's one on the team building side and then there's one on the fundraising side that's a cautionary tale that that I'll let you that I'll let you in on um the first one on the team side I mean I think that I the thing that I struggled the most with as a Founder was getting the leadership team correct and later I think building a proper EXE itive team which is a little different than a leadership team in the beginning your leadership team 1.0 is the founding team then eventually you have to start to say okay well we need functional experts across Marketing sales all these different functions so sometimes that can be the co-founders but likely it's other people too the co-founders just don't run everything forever that doesn't make sense um and then there's a period where you have to really assess are are these sort of homegrown people which is tends to be the case um which is Awesome by the way I I love starting in-house first versus just hiring gray-haired like corporate Executives that that can blow back in your face um but there's a moment in time where you have to really look around the table and say are these the right people running these functions you know like I'll just make up names Mike's running marketing you know Mike came with us you know he's been with us for five six years he had no marketing experience that's probably not an issue but you need to look have an honest conversation is this the person to take us to the next level sometimes yes sometimes no same with the co-founders and this is very difficult this is where I didn't always get this right a co-founder can be writing a fun running a function for for maybe too long because they have the founder title just like you might be the CEO for too long because you have the founder title so it applies to co-founders too and that's where you really have to have those open and honest conversations between each other to say a do you want this role and B are you the do you honestly feel like you're the best person for this next journey and let's be really clear about what that what that uh entails so we're starting this highland helps CEOs see what it entails to be to go from founder to CEO but just like that your your Executives around the table your leaders if it's a co-founder they need to know what marketing the the marketing 1.0 leader look you know they need to understand the transition from marketing 1.0 to marketing 2.0 to 3.0 so they can say am I that person right it's the same thing that you're doing with the CEO but you got to do it across the table so I really I mean I I delayed those tough convers ations too long I eventually had them and they were great um well they weren't great at first but they ended up it ended up being the Right Moves right but but always have the hard conversation as as quick as you can be self-aware be open and honest about those roles and then when we were hiring like more external big Executives um I made a lot of mistakes there too um partly on the you know the hiring front the the type of person I assumed that like A+ Talent somewhere else meant a plus Talent at class E that wasn't always the case there's a lot of values based stuff that we should have been doing in the hiring process to really understand what type of person this is to make sure they mesh with the culture um I had a great adviser who later became a board director and later became my successor who used to say who used to call this organ rejection so when someone came into the company and they might be awesome somewhere else like you know another big SAS company that everyone would know they're excited but then for some reason the culture just rejects them they have organ rejector because they're just they the the values aren't the same it's just not it's it's they're not taking the the the company in the right direction where because every new executive is going to help the company evolve but it has to help it evolve in the right way it's going to naturally Executives have big personalities all these things you want them pushing the company forward in the right direction sometimes they'll go sideways though and it's not even necessarily because they're doing anything wrong per se it's that they are trying to copy a formula that they've seen somewhere else apply it to the company they just joined and then [ __ ] kind of goes hey why and the company's like no no no no no no no this isn't the way we operate here and that's what great cultures do they assess what's going on they'll take the good for the good but if it's if there's some bad there they'll really look at that critically and then in the worst cases they'll almost fire the person for you because it's been rejected by the culture and so that happens sometimes it's painful it's painful to hire spend all the money bring in a new executive and then fire them six months to a year later like that no one wants to do that so for me spending more time researching interviewing getting that front end right really thinking through who are going to be the best people for these roles that can last at least three years and three years is a good amount of time when you're at scale like I think you can really look in in probably two to three year windows and if they make it further than that fantastic but you're really looking for like the best person in the world for that three-year stretch yeah and I just I just made too many mistakes or I had to learn through a lot of painful lessons uh on the executive team man it's a uh you I can feel the pain I've lived it a few times myself of realizing you made the wrong hire and I think that the longer I operate the longer it takes me to hire it just keeps getting long just because of how you know how many we add an extra step to the interview process we make sure they meet with the team like you really op you recognize how impactful it is to put the right person in the right role especially that has that lived experience for where we're trying to go like it is such a gift to make the higher for like you said the bad side is they come in they try to run a Playbook that they've ran somewhere else and it's not the right play it's incredible when they can come in and run a Playbook they've done somewhere else when it is the right play because there's so much less you know second G you know so much less guessing involved they speak to a level of conviction and they've seen I say all the time like I want someone who's been to the promised land it's coming back and telling us what it looks like um so I've just continued to add more steps to the uh to the hiring process um last last Point think you're dead oh I think you're dead on you want me to tell you the fundraising story real quick yeah that's what I was about to get to okay cool like you know for folks that um are thinking about raising money or have raised money and this ties into the hiring the executive team actually when you raise money especially when you raise a large Venture round you are even if the board is balanced and no one has quote unquote control those investors will have a lot of influence over the decisions that you make the decisions the board you know suggests you make and all of the things in between that's natural and that's in a way can be a good thing because they there should be a trusted adviser um but what I what I saw and experienced a lot was we would raise um money people would come in with their hard thoughts you know they'd come in objectively right like and be like oh you need this or you need that right and typically this would be like you need a CFO or you need a new this or you need that and that would that would like almost just push us unnaturally to go higher at an accelerated rate and it would it would it felt like oh my God this person's everything and like not there is no there's never a case where one person is everything but the investors will will put a lot of pressure on you to hire that person because they see a gap and and it's assumed that the person's going to fill that Gap and take you to the promised land and that's going to be the Silver Bullet that you know fixes all the company problems and it's not to say that it's not to say that like key hires leadership hires aren't massive leverage because they they actually are but again you don't want to rush that decision and the worst fundraising mistake I ever made was letting in our siries C investor who was a private Equity investor not a venture investor and it was just a total mismatch of values and a lot of things and we went through this where he you know he would say you need this you need that you need that and a couple of them didn't work work out but then he would point the finger and blame the company and the founder for making those wrong choices and that's a cycle you don't want to be in where it turns into a blame game and for us that actually went much further where that person turned unbelievably sour and actually tried to kick me out and the whole management team out of the company and we were sizable we were tens of millions of dollars in Revenue at this point and we had it was essentially an exential threat we had an activist investor and we had to Rally the internal shareholder base to buy this person out or we were we were done we were we were basically going to run out of cash and we were going to have to hand the keys to the castle to this investor who was bleeding us dry and wouldn't let wouldn't let Equity or wouldn't let any cash or new money come into the company wouldn't allow us to give employees stock options and many many other really really uh nefarious things and so I've lived that and we ended up successfully raising the capital to buy this company out and kick this person off the board and not surprisingly The company took off right after that I mean we literally went through a mass it's like we had a sickness just because of the person that we accepted the money from at the time and I chased valuation I did all the wrong things luckily the the terms of the deal were pretty clean because we were able to that's how we were able to actually defend ourselves because if we had let junk terms in with a high valuation we would have been [ __ ] and so really it was like a it's a it's a cautionary story because every other investor I let in were were were actually quite awesome and more supportive and I got really lucky and I made one bad choice and it was three years of absolute Hell worst three years of my life we thought the company was going to go under and it was actually a big company we would have let so many shareholders teammates customers down from what was essentially a power move you know it was it was a greedy profiteering move and for for me from that point forward I I just I I look at anyone I'm going to go into business with but certainly take money from as one of the most important decisions that you'll ever make and and and that played out at Classy and we were we were lucky to tell the tale and have this awesome story that we started with but it was through stories like that you know that was probably our worst one we didn't think we were going to get through that um but it's it's gnarly and you you live you know you you just you try to live to fight another day even when you're tens of millions of dollars in revenue and you think you got it right yeah you don't always got it you got to still think through these decisions yeah man I really appreciate you sharing that story and I think it's a great illust rtion of do just a lot of what I enjoy following along the content that you share and I'm looking forward to your next chapters you you go into into teaching and and uh sharing more is that you're a super purpose-- driven person and I think that it is core to your philosophy and Company building get align with like the values that's going that's going to inform the vision of the company what do we want to be when we grow up who do we let in who do we take money from um it sounds like most of your best decisions came came from from that Clarity and the ones that were you know the the lessons you survived were the ones that um Illustrated how important that is so Scott man really appreciate you coming on and sharing congrats on you know the closing of one chapter super excited to see what's coming up next uh we'll drop in the show us if you want to follow along Scott's got some really awesome content on his personal websites um we'll drop all the the link to follow but really appreciate you coming and jamming with me today oh super fun thanks for having me [Music]
