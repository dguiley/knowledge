this business strategy as you describe it doesn't look good if after 3 years uh your Enterprise goes bust if after 3 years you mean Ukraine loses right you mean if the Ukraine were just to lose got it and that's that's a highly likely scenario it's not a surprise that the United States embarks on a war and then after 2 years finds that domestic support for it es away that's not new [Music] Neil Ferguson where does this podcast find you I cannot disclose my location for reasons of National Security but I I'll say New England New England wow very mysterious so first off let's bust right into it um starting with something topical The Wall Street Journal uh reporter Evan gershkovich has been freed as part of what the White House National Security adviser described as a historic exchange something not seen since the Cold War Neil what do you make of this well I've been saying for the last six years that we're in Cold War II and there you go it's a very cold war thing to do prisoner exchanges with the other side and uh so for me it it's fresh evidence if if fresh evidence were needed that we're in a new Cold War and uh Russia as in the first cold war is on the other side uh so of course is China so so is Iran so is North Korea uh but this is a good day because obviously Evans release was something that uh everybody who has any connection with journalism was praying for and uh although of course we've had to let some Russian spies go uh to get him out I'm inclined to think that that is a price worth paying let me ask you though when when Britney grinder was uh exchange for you know this Merchant of death I think his name was Victor boot I was worried we were setting up a series of incentives that encouraged Russia and other kind of for like better term a of evil aess of evil Nations to take more and more people uh prisoner on unfounded charges do you have any and we don't know what they're what they're trading for here but do you think this sets up poor incentives that will only result in more Americans being incarcerated it's possible uh on the other hand they're not going to stop spying and we're not going to stop trying to catch their spies if the lesson of the Cold War uh is relevant here that didn't produce an escalating cycle of prisoner taking and so I wouldn't expect that to happen at in this case mainly because there are bigger pieces on the chessboard than spies and journalists and in the end the cold war is like a massive game of chess and these are pawns or if there were pieces smaller than pawns they would be they would be those and the Russians have much bigger pieces that they want to move and bigger pieces of ours that they want to take like say Ukraine and in that sense there's no there's no obvious rationale in their accumulating uh more ill will by arresting more journalists and I'd be surprised if it happened on a larger scale in the coming years so let let's use that as a jumping off point talking about the war in Ukraine give us what you think the state of play is there uh what you think a likely outcome is and uh how you would approach it or what advice you would have for Western policy makers as a relates to Ukraine well there are two perhaps more than two but two pla Futures uh depending on who wins uh the election on November 5th in the scenario in which CA Harris uh wins there'll be a continuity of the policy that has got us to where we are and that policy has been outwardly to support Ukraine and its maximum War aims by saying Ukraine sets the war privately to continue the war at such a level of support that Ukraine doesn't lose but not at such a level that it can win that policy I imagine would continue uh into the next four years if Harris wins because I wouldn't expect a big change to the National Security strategy or team there'd be some changes but I don't think there would be a huge uh shift and the danger with that policy became obvious uh last year and earlier this year if the US stops its support for Ukraine then Ukraine loses for six months the House of Representatives cut off Financial military aid from the US to Ukraine the Europeans couldn't compensate for the short fall and Ukraine started to lose the war because it simply cannot maintain its defenses along this now very long front without American support and so the risk of a protracted War without a conclusion is that at some point we lose interest or politics leads us to lose interest and then I think Ukraine loses the War I was always against prolonging the war I said uh in late 2022 when it was going well for Ukraine that it would have been ideal de to lock in some kind of uh peace negotiation then when Ukraine's fortunes were at their height because if it if it dragged on the sheer superiority of Russian resources would be bound to tell so that's one future and it's not one that I or indeed my Ukrainian friends find very appetizing especially because in this future you'd expect uh a president haris to be as easily intimidated by threats of nuclear escalation as President Biden has been uh from a very early stage in the war the Russians realized that if they said nuclear weapons the Biden Administration would kind of pull back and this has put a lid on the support that the Biden Administration has given Ukraine it's I think the best explanation for why support has been enough not to lose but not enough to win so now let's imagine scenario two in which Donald Trump is reelected after a 4-year intermission what would that be like many people wrongly assume that Trump would just throw zalinski president zalinski of Ukraine under the nearest available bus and uh do a deal with Vladimir Putin the Russian president that would be hugely favorable for Russia that is not I think what would happen and the reason I say that is that one National Security uh spokesman after another on the Republican side had has come out against that kind of isolationist the hell with Ukraine stance in recent months if you look closely at what Trump says if you look closely at what JD Vance said to the New York Times last week you will see that the Trump plan is radically different the Trump plan is to put huge pressure on Russia economic and Military make the sanctions bite more make the weapons available to Ukraine more powerful in order to force Putin to the negotiating table and then you're going to try and rerun the Korean piece of of 1953 where you don't actually ever get to a peace agreement but you have an Armistice of the fighting stops and then this nasty border just kind of stabilizes roughly where it is I think that's that's the very different future that that we'll get if if Trump wins that sounds like in some sort of an endorsement of the Trump plan as it relates to Ukraine and what I would say is and I don't know this as well as we haven't tracking as closely but you know I remember Trump saying I'd have this done in a day and my sense is that Putin and his uh supporters are bigger fans or are hoping for a trump Administration but you think that actually a trump Administration would in fact go harder at Russia in the short term trying to force a deal well that's I think exactly what Mike Pompeo said in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week he said the sanctions have not been enforced nearly hard enough we need to go after the Russian Banks we need to really make uh the Russian economy hurt we need to confiscate the reserves and make them available to Ukraine as reparations and we need to step up the uh Firepower that we give Ukraine in order to force a negotiation upon the Russians and I'm not endorsing Donald Trump when I say that that makes more sense to me as a plan than carrying on with what we're currently doing which I think will lead to Ukraine's defeat the longer this lasts uh and the more we drip feed uh weapons to Ukraine the more likely it is that ultimately Russia's Superior Manpower Superior raw materials Superior resources are together lead to Victory and we really have to avoid a Russian Victory so I think it makes sense to try and get to an Armistice and what's interesting is that if if if you talk to people close to zalinski they will privately say we kind of prefer this to what we're getting from Biden which is this drip feeding of support and this constant language of deescalation the problem about the word deescalation which the Biden Administration loves as a word is that in practice it means the opposite of deterrence and you need to to have some deterrence you have to make it clear to Russia that it will cost them to carry on this war if you're going to have any kind of Peace negotiation of course it doesn't get done in a day these things never get done in a day it'll take 6 months 12 months and I don't think even at the end of 12 months there'll be agreement on everything but if you can get an Armistice a ceasefire even that hugely helps Ukraine even at the cost of accepting for who knows how long that the Russians controlled a part of their territory and that the frontier between them and the bad guys would be a very dangerous place for quite a long time to come so just for the purpose of discussion some push back I see that Biden and Harris have distinctive some dysfunction in Congress that as you said delayed funding for the war for 6 months which was I think I would describe more of a lack of leadership on the part of Congress not necessarily Biden and Harris and that this has been in my view I think of the president as a CEO responsible for allocating resources to their greatest return I would argue this return uh has been one of the greatest Investments the West has ever made we've taken out what a third of Russia's kinetic power defanged the reputation of the supposedly ferocious Army given sheep Paws before he tries to invade um Taiwan without ever even putting a boot on the ground an American boot on the ground NATO is out of its brain coma Europe is finally unified and I don't want to in any way diminish the incredible loss of human life on both sides uh and then on the other side this notion that the Trump Administration would put forward more pressure when I hear JD Vance consistantly saying he's indifferent and doesn't care about Ukraine you don't worry that it emboldens Putin to be less apt or inclin to accept some sort of Deal or Armistice here I I I see the opposite I see this emboldening Russia not not getting them to the negotiation table the problem with your first point is that uh this business strategy as you describe it doesn't look good if after 3 years uh your Enterprise goes bust if after three years you mean Ukraine loses right you mean if the Ukraine were just a lose got it and that's that's a highly likely scenario it's not a surprise that the United States embarks on a war and then after two years finds that domestic support for it es away that's not new domestic support for Aid to multiple countries uh in Cold War I uh faded and so to say that it's all the fourth of the House of Representatives is to slightly missed the point it was obvious from the outset that there would be a finite amount of domestic patience in channeling resources to a a war in Eastern Europe that really ought to be much more a concern of Europeans than Americans I think the risk that they ran when they said to the M themselves which they did let's keep this going cuz we're really destroying Russia's military capability the risk that they ran was that in the end if Russia won albe it at a high cost then Putin would be the winner so I think this was a very poor business strategy and I said so at the time it would have been much smarter to try and push for a pce or at least an armus when the war was going really badly for the Russians which it was in late 2022 when they were driven back from kke they nearly lost large amount of uh of their military outside Heron that was a moment when I think you could have uh attempted a negotiation and and we didn't do that because we thought we're so clever we're going to fight to last Ukrainian and exhaust Russia's military point1 point two Vance has changed his tone because uh it's been explained to him and to speaker Mike Johnson and to all the people in the house this is what happens if Ukraine loses and what's been fascinating to me got over the last 6 months or so has been to see that the isolationist faction within the Republican party which is quite well represented in the House of Representatives has been routed and the reason that it's been routed uh is that they had it explained to them in I presume intelligence briefings what would happen if Ukraine lost and then they realized that not only would Putin be laughing but so would Shin ping and what's interesting in in this past six months is that the argument that I made last year is now almost conventional wisdom amongst Republicans namely that there is an AIS of China Russia Iran North Korea that it is engaged in a cold war against the United States and its allies and a victory for Russia and Ukraine is a victory for xiin Ping as surely as it's a victory of Vladimir Putin Republicans have had that explained to them they've had it drummed into their heads that if you let Russia win it's a very bad outcome for the US and its allies and a very good outcome for China and its allies so I think there's been a big shift not everybody's noticed this but I think it's very important because it means that Putin who is certainly paying attention is realizing that a trump Administration won't simply hand in Ukraine uh in a phone call I think that that scenario was never very likely and it's certainly not going to happen now thoughts on the war in the Middle East well we're speaking on what could be the eve of uh a new war the one that is brewing between Israel and Hezbollah uh the probability that that war happens this August is I think high now after the events of recent days it's pretty clear that uh Benjamin Netanyahu came back from Washington and made like alucino The Godfather uh and settled family business uh with the succession of of uh a remarkable hits against uh Israel's enemies it's difficult for me to see that there isn't uh retaliation for that I think the Israelis expect it it's possible that the Iranians and Hezbollah duck because they don't want to be drawn into that conflict on the other hand they may realize that there's some non tral probability that Donald Trump gets reelected in which case their situation is going to be much worse next year because Trump will will ramp up the pressure on Iran in a way that Biden has not so I'm afraid we're probably on the eve of of a war that will make the war against Hamas look quite small because Hezbollah is much much better armed than Hamas it has a formidable arsenal of of weapons and missiles and if this war does break out as I think it is increasingly likely it's going to be a bloody war for both sides and and Israel will certainly suffer more casualties than it than it has in the war in Gaza it appears that the calculation is that Israel's decided they're ready that they're they're up for that fight your thoughts it's been a debate within the government since October the 7th I was uh in uh Israel in the spring and met with uh members of the government uh as well as with their opponents uh and the critics of of Mr Netanyahu and what struck me was that although the political divisions remain very deep in Israel and hostility to BB is is something that is is very widespread nevertheless October the 7th changed something in Israel and created a new Unity not a political Unity but a Unity of purpose the sense that a second Holocaust was premeditating was being planned by the likes of Hamas has greatly changed the atmosphere of the country and it has made even my liberal friends in Tel Aviv more or less write off the idea of a Palestinian State and more or less acques in a very aggressive policy directed against Hamas Palestinian Islamic Jihad and now Hezbollah so if you go back to the days after October the 7th when we were all reeling from the sheer horror of what was done by Hamas and its Confederates the debate that was going on within the Israeli uh government was do we hit Hamas or do we actually go after Hezbollah and uh defense minister galance and other military advisers said we should go after Hezbollah because it's the stronger of our enemies and the planes were on their way they had taken off to hit Hezbollah when Netanyahu overruled that that decision and said no we we go after Hamas first so the as always the Middle East needs to be understood partly through the lens of Israeli domestic politics many people forget just how important that is given it's the only democracy in the region you have to follow its democracy closely and that battle about when do we hit Hezbollah has been going on ever since October and I think ultimately the realiz ation is you can't postpone indefinitely a showdown a because they keep acquiring more Weaponry B because your people uh near the lebanes border were evacuated many months ago now and they want to go back to their homes you got a very large displaced population uh that was moved away from the Lebanese border if you want to get them back in time for the school year you have to do this now in August so I think although one can never be certain I think we're quite close to the brink of a new phase of of the Middle Eastern conflict which in many cases is a multi-front war already it's not just about Gaza though that's what has dominated media coverage it's also about Iran's direct attacks uh on Israel it's about the houthis uh this is a very complex picture but Hezbollah is the organization that poses the most Clear and Present threat to Israel and sooner or later there's going to be a showdown and I think the argument that has been made by the Israeli Security Services and armed services is why wait for them to hit us first why give them the initiative if we take the initiative then we're likely to suffer fewer casualties than if they do yeah it felt as if I don't know if assassinations are the right word or strikes were pretty bold and that Israel the way I read it was Israel believes that they are coming to an end of the war in Gaza that the tunnels are nearly taken out they've kind of cut the region in half in controlling the flow of Hamas I I was actually struck by how bold this was that they're effectively willing to open up a two-front war is that your sense of it yes I don't think it's born of overconfidence though rather the opposite I think there's considerable dis Qui about the extent to which Hamas has really been destroyed there's a sense that Israel has to act now because the longer it waits the worse the situation becomes s so I think this decision to force the issue with Iran and and with Hezbollah uh has has been taken because they realize that they're they're getting nowhere with cisar negotiations with the hostage negotiations because there's no good faith on the side of of Hamas their situation internationally is one of relative isolation that's not new in the history of Israel and the support that they've received from Biden Administration has been tepid ambivalent and there are elements of the administration that clearly still somehow believe that you can reach a a modus ofendi with Iran or resuscitate the Iran nuclear deal so the Israelis have decided it might as well be now it's not ideal but if not now when is our situation really going to be better next year I think that's what's going you think it's fair to call the Biden support of Israel or involvement of Israel's T but my understanding is it'd be difficult to point to any country in the world in my view that has provided more steadfast support than the us immediately deploying carrier strike forces coordinating around intelligence coordinating around uh defense systems for the missile attack from Iran you you really think it's fair to call the support from the US taid yeah I do I mean because apart from the initial fine words that that Joe Biden uttered uh the the support has been publicly uh internationally teer uh of course these things are all relative the US is more supportive of Israel than any European country yeah I mean there are European countries that are recognizing a Palestinian State this year even though it doesn't exist doesn't seem likely to exist but if you compare by en's Administration with say Richard Nixon's in 1973 which was the last time Israel suffered a surprise attack uh the scale of the support was far greater then us support for Israel is much less important economically than it was 50 years ago much much smaller share of of Israeli GDP because the Israeli economy is actually a much bigger uh and more Innovative economy so one mustn't make the mistake of thinking that the US is absolutely crucial to Israel it's much less crucial than it it was uh from a military as well as an economic standpoint but it's it's not indispensable and so for example the big problem that doesn't get talked about nearly enough is that Iran is now very close to having a nuclear capability I asked the Biden official not so long ago are you in fact acting like they do have nuclear capability are you treating them as if they already are a nuclear armed power because although you sent to aircraft carrier groups they didn't actually do anything to P punish Iran for its obvious complicity in October the 7th and on the whole the administration tried after October the 7th to pretend like Iran wasn't involved which got hard to do when the Iranians Unleashed a direct drone and missile attack on Israel for the first time in the history of the Islamic Republic so I think this kind of ambivalence which characterizes the administration as a whole uh is in marked contrast to the support that Israel could count on in the 70s when that support was absolutely indispensable uh I I'll add one other point back in the 70s you did not have a wing of the democratic party the progressive Wing taking the side of the Palestinians and so the politics is very different in 2024 as compared with 1974 uh in 1974 the Democratic party was pretty strongly supportive of Israel and had a significant uh Jewish element which Nixon used to complain about because he would always that he was doing so much for Israel and where was the Gratitude typical Nixon but we're in a very different world today where you know although Joe Biden's still kind of rooted in that era and I think he means it when he talks about the US commitment to Israel there are plenty of people to the left of Joe Biden who certainly don't feel that way we'll be right back so let's move to the US you said that um uh vice president Harris is a California Democrat through and through therefore will be hard to draw in moderate voters and also you've described the Republicans Remain the captives of the personality called the Maga movement and the Democrats Remain the captives of the donor crats the wealthy Friends of the Clans and the Obamas give us what you think the state of play is in the election and who who do you think is likely to Prevail in November M well anybody who tells you they know the answer to that question in August of an election year I think is having you on it's once again close to a coints we've gone back to where we were on the eve of the debate that blew Joe Biden's hopes of reelection up and the polls are going to be noisy probably for the next few weeks because not only you have the bounce that comes with the novel uh uh nominee but you have the probable bounce that comes with the convention so my sense is that when all of this bouncing is over and we get to Labor Day uh they will be some return to where we were in June with uh Trump slightly ahead but with some polls putting Harris ahead and within the Marin of error and then you'll look at the states that are in play and you'll say well it's still pretty close in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Michigan and maybe there are some other states that have changed a bit since Harris became the nominee but it's close and and that's not surprising because if you set aside the personalities of the candidates which media they pay more more attention to than is warranted American politics is really run by two machines Republican and Democratic Party machines and these machines are very good at delivering Most states and most counties within Most states to one or other party leaving very little contested ground and the contested ground is contested partly uh because it just has demographic peculiarities and partly because uh there are independent voters who are up for grbs uh who vote one way in one election and another way in another so when you kind of take a step back and look at American politics two things are really striking one uh it's a two-party system still and there aren't any others like that everywhere else including in the English speaking world where they used to have two-party systems like the UK doesn't have a two-party system anymore but the US has institutionalized uh duopoly and it's extraordinar difficult to get into that uh to break that duopoly even although about a third of the electorates say they're Independence and would rather that they had another option second really striking thing is that one party has retained Elite control Democrats that's why I use the term donats because the wealthy Elite currently in the Hamptons or in Aspen uh that Elite still controls the party they determined that Biden was no longer viable and they agreed that it would be Harris and that they wouldn't have a contested or open convention all of this was done with phone calls and texts between oh perhaps a dozen people who made the decision the difference with the Republican party is that their equivalents the wealthy uh Republican donors no longer control the party those people would have far rather Ronda santis was the nominee and when that didn't work out they would far rather have had Nikki Haley but they failed because a Marga movement that is part of Personality cult around Donald Trump Now controls the Republican party and that's what makes this election close because if you had a better organized better disciplined Republican machine and a more conventional candidate you would absolutely clean up in this election the Democrats are very vulnerable on key issues they had an inflation mistake that was predictable and people haven't forgiven them they have an immigration problem on their hands because of the Southern border those two issues alone should ensure that the next president's a republican but because of Republican part is no longer under the control of its leaves it's capable of making tremendous self-harming mistakes and that may give camela Harris chance to be president of the United States so just on the inflation issue I I would argue it's unfair to lay at the feet of Biden my sense of inflation is too many dollars facing too few products and with the amount of stimulus presented with in both the Trump and Biden Administration where 85% of it was saved and it just went into the market which sent prices skyrocketing and had more money chasing tfue products and ultimately I would argue the culprit of inflationist Putin who interrupt interrupted the supply chain don't you think both Trump and Biden share equal blame along with Putin for inflation it just think it's unfair to say that Biden had a misstep around inflation that's any greater than the misstep around Trump your thoughts Scott I I seem to remember that your family uh hails as mine does from the East End and I don't remember anybody in sheon Sandy Hills nobody in Sandy Hills ever said life was fair in fact it was a recurrent refrain of my childhood uh life isn't fair get used to it no of course politics is not fair and the voters are deeply unfair to Joe Biden when it comes to the performance of the economy which practically any president of the last 100 years would have seized with both hands if it had been offered here's the deal you get full employment you get surging growth you get investment in uh manufacturing structures uh I mean markets touching alltime highs and the stock markets roaring and and inflation has a 9% high in the midterm year and then it then it falls back towards 2% I mean the presidents going all the way back a 100 years would have taken the data that this president has presided it over uh with relish and yet the voters about the economy to every pollster who calls them up and why is that so there are two theories as you know Scott Theory one is uh they just don't forgive 9% because they got real really used to low single digigit inflation and high single digit inflation has made them mad and they like the price level they don't care about core CPI or core pce they just like hey it's still expensive compared with what it was that that's expl explanation number one I have a lot of sympathy with that explanation because it tracks with my observation of how ordinary people think about the economy but then there's the Larry Summers point which you probably know which is well actually higher rates might not hurt you through your mortgage if you have a 30-year mortgage but it hurts you through a whole bunch of other things whole bunch of other debts you have so you take your pick my my basic view of this is that the Democrats were dreaming last year when they said they were going to run on Biden omics cuz the voters hate biomics and it's unfair uh I I will add the fair part is that the inflation overshoot in the US was a direct consequence of fiscal Overkill in 2021 that was the result of hubis in the Biden Administration they did not need to throw so much money at the economy when the vaccines said 90% plus efficacy and I said that at the time Sumer has also said it that this was a an avoidable policy error they did not need to juice the economy as aggressively as they did most of the inflation in Europe was Putin's fault it was basically a supply shock about half or more the inflation in the US was a demand effect which I think came from keeping the stimulus going too long after the pandemic was was beginning uh to dissipate and then finally as we wrap up here both of us have spent time uh in different directions and different tenures in different parts of our life but in the UK the US I would argue those are the two Nations you know the best they're the two Nations I know the best and my understanding is you're now spending more time in the UK after spending a lot of time in the US can you compare and contrast what the difference between business and politics and general lifestyle between your observations having spent time in both countries and what it says about us yes well Britain the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to be precise is uh despite a brief for with Republican government in the mid 17th century a monarchy that retains a hereditary aristocracy even though they've just lost their seats in the House of Lords it is a society still bound to a striking extent by tradition and I noticed this having returned to spend more time in the UK for family reasons because I've spent most of the last 20 years in this revolutionary Republic the United States of America which still has the character of a revolutionary Republic when you view it through British eyes the way in which this election is being conducted the vituperation the threat of violence the sheer nastiness is very reminiscent of the American politics Charles Dickens encountered when he visited uh early in the 19th century and was AED British politics is still a game of cricket between people who went to Oxford and you saw that very clearly when Rishi sunak Was roundly Defeated uh by Siria ston July 4th uh the the handshakes the jokes the iale chap jolly good show bad luck old boy I mean all of that is exactly the way in which British politicians have conducted themselves over 200 years and so there's a sense in which uh that continuity limits the range of outcomes in British politics even after a period of turmoil that brexit created that period of turmoil was like periods of turmoil in the 19th century over the Corn Laws over protectionism uh turmoil over the Irish Question although we have periods of turmoil and we've had years of multiple prime ministers before the system remains stable around particularly around Oxford University because there seems to be one uh rule of British politics and that is that the Prime Minister has to have been to Oxford there are very very few exceptions to that rule having said all that we would be deluding ourselves if we didn't recognize some similarities and points of convergence I don't think Taylor Swift is a smaller deal in the UK than in the US I don't think AI is a smaller deal unites us I was that was the first the second was of course Ai and the third is this potential for conflict over immigration it's tragic that three little girls were murdered by uh it appears the teenage son of uh immigrants from Rwanda when the girls were attending a Taylor Swift dance class and this has Unleashed a a kind of classic summertime uh period of of of violence in the UK that reminds us that it's not all cricket and Well Done old chat that some of the trends that have produced populism uh and political violence in the US are are in fact still are to be found in the United Kingdom too it's interesting if I understand you're correctly you're saying the coarseness of our discourse in the US might be a feature not a bug oh it's absolutely a feature and and visitors commented on it from very early on in the Republic the the sense that politics in America is a contact sport perhaps even a blood sport where whereas in Britain it's cricet that goes back a very very long way indeed but you know we're divided by a Common Language United by a great deal of increasingly Global popular culture and both the United States and United Kingdom face the same sociological dilemma we are aging societies half of uh the electorate in the United States is over 50 it's somewhat similar perhaps even older in the UK okay older voters are not only more numerous relative than they used to be but they also turn out at higher rates than younger voters and older voters want two contradictory things they don't really like inflation that's nothing new but they also don't like immigration the problem is that if you don't have large-scale immigration the inflation would have been higher think about the counter faal of closed borders in the period of the last four years inflation would certainly been higher because the tight labor markets would have driven wages up and so it's very hard to satisfy what old American and old British voters want they also want Health Care in the US this manifests itself as a sort of Health uh Insurance inflation problem uh in the UK the National Health Service rations health care and so everybody's always grumbling that they take weeks take weeks to get a do doctor's appointment and months if not years to get uh a surgical procedure but it's the same basic problem it's just that the systems are radically different in the way that they work so as I go back and forth across the Atlantic which I have to do far too often I'm struck by the fact that although we think of ourselves as being very different and in some institutional respects we are there is real convergence in the experience of being British and the experience of being American whether you an oldd or a Taylor Swift fan sir Neil Ferguson is a Milbank family senior
