# Find hidden markets everyone ignores

Published: 2025-08-31

In this video, I am going to show you 12 boring SAS ideas that you can build in the accounting software category. Pretty boring. Then we are going to list the different subcategories to find out which ones are growing. And finally we will do sort of vibe market research uh using deep research agents like Jiminy cloud research or open AAI chat GPT deep research and we will look into one specific subcategory that we found using the deep research agents to find out the exact market gaps like aka business ideas based on the customer feedback. we will mostly use AI to do the whole process. So market research has changed a lot in the recent weeks and this is so far like the the fastest way I have to go from barely know a market to like educate yourself on the market. Make sure it is growing. Uh find out all the the subcategories within this market. uh validate the demand for each categories and uh isolate what specific unsolved needs uh can still be built to compete in this market. So each of the ideas that I'm about to show you are subcategories that have growing demand. But just before we go into the ideas, let me tell you it's not the most important. What's the most important is to understand how you can reproduce that for yourself. So very quickly let's go from the very beginning and as you can see here we have what I call the evergreen program maps. uh it's a huge mind map that I've built that contains all the problems that every company uh have mostly all the company have the same problems and they are willing to pay for someone to help them to solve this problems but for the sake of this uh video we are going to start with the accounting software space. So the very first thing we want to do before everything anything else is to um look into Google trend. So simply by typing the name of the market we want to explore, we can see already that this is a solid market. It's not a incredibly growing market and um we can see that there is some kind of um downtrend here but it this this doesn't really matter. What matters is that it is stable with a high volume and that it is currently growing. So now that we made sure that there is demand in this market and that we can comfortably see ourself building within this market the second step even though it's boring is to educate ourself on the market and for that I use an um what I call an industry deep dive prompt which is part of the methodology that you can find the link is in the description. Uh but this industry deep dive deep dive prompt um when you use it with geiny which I tend to prefer when it comes to really understand the market um gives you this sort of report and I actually read it this one for the sake of this video um mostly maybe 80% but I'm not going to read it to you because the watch time will die instantly. So what I did is I simply summarized it with code. So we are talking about the accounting software space. So market opportunity large growing market 15 to 20 billion globally projected to reach 30 billion by 2030. Regional focus North America 35% market share and Europe offer the best opportunities. Core market paradox. The biggest inside is a fundamental disconnect. Market leaders like QuickBooks dominate through market share but generate widespread customer hatred. This create a massive opportunity for customer centric alternatives. This is the first insights uh that we can start thinking of when building on this market. Customer pain points. The analysis reveal deep frustration with incumbents. Predatory pricing and reliable software, terrible support, non-existent or unhelpful customer service, feature blo forced to pay for complex features they don't need. Strategic recommendation target frustrated escapists solopreneurs and micro businesses actively seeking alternatives to incumbent solutions particularly in e-commerce sales tax compliance. So this is something I don't really like with Germany is despite the fact that it gives a lot of very interesting information he always wants to give advices but at this point I didn't want advice advices I just wanted to understand um how is the market going who are the main actors what are the the first frustration I can understand and it gave it to me um but he also gave me some advices and it's it's was wrong. We will see uh right now in the while looking into the ideas but it's not what I wanted specifically. So now that I I know about the market, so I picked one, I made sure there is demand, a growing market, I educated myself. Now I want to start listing the subcategories and to do that I again use another prompt which is the subcategory finder prompt which is again another uh prompt for deep research. When I say deep research, uh, it always means one of those deep research AI agents. So here you have Jiminy Claude or or Chad Gypt, but it could also be perplexity, it could be uh Grock, it could be Manus AI, Genpark, whatever the one you prefer. I like to work with those three and I don't use them for the same purposes. As I said, uh, Germany for me is more when I want to learn about something, but when I want to achieve a specific task like the subcategory listing report, then I'd rather use cloud or CHPG. So this prompt basically will ask deep research to look into all the different uh job to be done and and different categories within the accounting software category and to list out all the potential Google queries that are showing those categories. So for me it's very easy to just pick a query and validate it on Google trend to see if there is um demand and for each of them to list um to give me the main actors the ones that are ranking first in this specific subcategory. So this is the moment where I'm showing you the different ideas and for now uh let's look at the first ones and this is absolutely not an idea because it starts with the most mainstream queries which is for example accounting software for small businesses. This is not something you want to take as a category to build in because it's way too big but it just gives some uh interesting insights. So there is obviously a huge volume. Uh it's growing and it's growing exactly the same way as this one. So it confirms what we knew already. Uh and we also know that small businesses are a big part of the um software accounting. Hey, just a quick break. This video is actually sponsored by myself and I want to show you something that might just make your next customer say, "Finally, that's exactly what I've been looking for." If you're a founder, especially a technical one, you've probably hit this wall. You can build the product, but when it comes to explaining it so people actually want to buy it, you end up guessing. And guessing cost you money, cost you time, and cost you momentum. That's why I have built the voice mining framework. It's not another fluffy branding or guru marketing course. It's a plug-and-play system that uses AI to mine your market's exact language, their pains, desires, and buying triggers straight from where they already talk online. Then it turns that research into ready to use landing pages, ads, email, short form script, long form script, whatever marketing assets that you need. Bottom line, you stop writing what you think will work and start using words you know will convert. You can grab it today, run it this afternoon and have a real datab messaging before dinner. The link is below. Now let's back to the video which was expected actually. Then we have u I'm just going here on the the trend. So you don't have to read that. That's not really interesting. So let's just keep uh going with the trends. Bookkeeping software, same thing. It's not specific enough. Cloud accounting software, same thing. Although you have something I didn't dig into that, but to me it's not specific enough for one a solo founder to go into a category and start building something because that's what we want is for you to as a solo founder to pick a subcategory and build something within it. Uh here I have accounting software for e-commerce. For some reason, I don't have a volume. But if I look into accounting software for Shopify, I have a better volume here. And I have a growing demand. So there we have it, the first one. So if we look into what it says here, accounting software with Shopify, find accounting software that can directly integrate with Shopify stores to sync orders, payout, inventory, and financial financials. Monthly search volume estimate measure. We have QuickBooks.org. We have my work for my work syncs for QuickBook. Um, A2X Cinder Zero and WebG. I don't know how to say that. We are going to look into the next one actually because I didn't dig into the Shopify, but just it tells you for the first one what you can get. So you start by looking into the query. Go into Google trend. Type the query. See if there is demand and if if you see that there is a volume first of all if the subcategory is relevant then the volume is big enough and it is a growing market and if possible stable then you can start look into the different players. And I didn't do it for this one, but I did it a little bit for this one. Second one, the accounting software for Amazon. The volume is pretty low, but I just found it was really interesting because now we are talking about something very specific. Like we are talking about the category and then the subcategory is very is specific enough for someone to go into it and and decide to build a a solution that fits perfectly the need of this uh specific people. And the thing is we have something happening. I don't really usually like that when it's like so sudden but something is happening. So that's a good sign. So this is the second one. Then we have accounting software for Salesforce. Same thing we have small volume but again it's not the only volume. If you look at all the different uh search queries then in the end the volume is bigger than that and there are businesses. So it's you can't compare it with um other volumes in the in the B2C space. Uh and the same thing we have something happening um recently. Don't know why, but I thought it was also pretty interesting. Shopify QuickBook integration. We have some kind of volume here that is a little bit more interesting. Although the trend um somehow weird, but the volume is there and it goes along with the one we had earlier, accounting software for Shopify. Then we can see that a lot of people are using QuickBooks and need an integration with Shopify. Then we have accounting software for construction. So this is a subcategory that is pretty solid actually. The volume is very high for this type of query and we can see that we have like a a very stable market that is growing recently. So this is exactly what you want to look into. Construction is a big market and you can probably find a lot of problem and pains that are not properly solved yet. Next one we have the accounting software for nonprofit. So again, uh I thought this one was interesting because of the fact that it is very specific when you think about it like the I mean I'm not really an expert in nonprofit at all, but I guess they have a total total different approach of um accounting with specific need. I I I guess the volume is good. uh and I did some exploration and I found some uh actors that are doing it which is a good sign actually. Then we have the accounting software for real estate. Um this one same thing we have good volume and we have something happening uh recently and which is all related to the the global growth that we can see here in the recent weeks or months. Next one we have accounting software for rental property. Again we have a solid volume. Something happening recently. Then we have accounting software for restaurants. We have a decent volume and there is definitely something to do in this cate subcategory. And we have accounting software for freelancers or self-employed accounting software. Those are two search terms that goes along with each other. And the total volume is pretty good and I I suspect that it it's probably a lot bigger than that and I will show you why. Um but this is a very interesting subcategory that I did explore and this is actually the category that I went through the whole system with. So just stay tuned because that's the next step of the video. This one uh didn't take it. Um I think it was startups is way too f um to me it's not specific enough. Lego syncing software. Okay. Um makes sense. Volume is good. A lot of legal films. Um probably the market is crowded already but it is still a grow a market that is growing and there is probably something to do here if you start digging into it. Then we have best accounting software for Max, which I didn't select. Uh, accounting software with payroll, I don't know exactly, didn't talk to me. Accounting software with inventory management. Okay. Multicurrency accounting. Turns out it's a lot about the big ones. And the big ones we have Zero, we have Quickbook online, we have Sage, Oracle, Zoho Books, Wave. Wave is pretty much everywhere. Um, so no, not interesting. and account payable automation software. To be honest, I don't know what's account payable in English, but I figured um it's an interesting one because reading a little bit into it, um people are actually searching for this thing specifically. So, if you want to look into it, feel free. Uh and the last one, account receivable automation software, which is same principle as the one above. Okay, now let's look into the next step which is digging into the different actors in each market. So let's start by the accounting software for Amazon. The one I told you earlier, I found this one accurate e-commerce accounting on autopilot. Um, which is kind of Amazon, not really, but it was mentioned here in my report. So yes, why not? And then I figured um also this one but it's kind of an aggregator of all the different tools for accounting um and the pricing is also quite low which told me okay it has traffic so every time I will show you the the traffic and that's that's the interesting thing and somehow it's it's quite funny to to see the the discrepancy between the search volume and the traffic that those tools have. Um but first of all they are not only specific for Amazon I don't think so um and they they are already quite well established so it is worth digging into it um going to the next step but I didn't find it was the most interesting one uh then we have here the uh accounting software for nonprofits so something I didn't know anything about but turns out there are quite big players here you have A+ which um is manage finance uh people and giving for your nonprofits or church and it has 300,000 uh visits per month which is very decent uh for an accounting software. I don't know what revenues they are making. Uh one thing you can check as well is just to take the the link. So, I will show you how you do that. You just pick the link. So, that's the the website I showed you. And what I like to do is to go to the wayback machine because sometimes it's very handy to to know if if a website is around since a long time or not. So, you you can kind of feel if you are facing competitors that are there since forever or or if it's still a dynamic market. And then this website basically takes screenshot of the whole internet. I don't know. I have no idea how they are doing that but it takes screenshots of the whole internet and and you can access them. So for example, if I want to see first of all here I can see that this domain is um out there since a long time actually um 2013. But you need to check it out be because sometimes the domain has been sold and the website is actually new but the domain domain was there before. So that's the first thing you want to make sure you want to go back in time and check if the website was already doing the thing they are doing right now. But let's check in 2021. And then as you can see, it was already uh working and doing the exact same thing. So the domain um was already owned by the same company. And what's also interesting using the wayback machine is that you can sometimes it's very easy to look at a product company that is doing things right right now and and forget that they had a long way of iterations to get there to get where they are now. And looking into the wayback machine, you can see year by year how they change their messaging, how they change their positioning, their offers. So it's a very very interesting tool is free. So it's a it's a it's something that you you should absolutely use when you are researching specific market. Anyway, that was a big parenthesis for Wayback Machine. And now let's go back to the the other players in the nonprofit industry. And as you can see here, you have one that is specific, but it is a small one. Put it here anyway. And we have another one where nonprofit treasurer go for peace of mind. Nice. And the traffic is quite decent. So looking I think by looking a little bit more into it, you can find other competitors. And this is good thing. No, you absolutely want competitors that are already targeting exactly the this specific pain point. You are absolutely not looking for being the first because if you are the first, there might be something wrong somewhere. Um, but then um you need to decide if it's something you want to do or not. And for the sake of this video, I didn't use this one, the nonprofit to go for the next step. Uh I used actually the next that we are going to go into which is the um freelancer industry volume was interesting and um and it was also given to me by the very first report um when I was educating myself I I saw that there was a lot of pain with the freelancing industry. So this is what I did and where the first tool that I found um by looking into here. So what I don't want to do is to I know them know I know the big ones like QuickBooks, Fresh Books, Wave, Zo Book. I'm looking into the ones that I don't know the name. So Bonsai I thought was uh specific for freelancer but they are probably using it but it's not specific for freelancers. It's an accounting software for services and it has very very good traffic like 4 and a half which is really good but not specific enough. So what I did and I'm going to show you how I did that. So let's open this one. So that's the same website. And now if I click to this uh extension which is by the way I mean I think I'm presenting this extension in all of my videos. Nice Chrome extension that also help you to have the volume within Google trend. Um and helps you to see for example when I'm looking into a specific keyword I have the volume here and I have all the related keywords next to it. So definitely recommend this extension. It's really a shame I don't have an affiliate link because I really talk a lot talk a lot about this uh this tool but I'm recently exploring other um things they are doing and so one thing I've started using recently is this feature which allows to see at the domain level the traffic that the the website is receiving. So you can see all the different keywords for which it's ranking. And I say I didn't when I opened it, I didn't exactly know what to look into. But that is also another very interesting thing when researching is that I never really know what I'm looking at, but I'm always trying to find something that attracts my my attention. But in this case, I simply copied it uh the whole thing. Then I put it within um Germany just like that without saying anything just to see what he thinks about this um this report. And he started talking about different competitors for which it should rank for Honeybook alternative. And I was like Honeybook what's that? Then turns out Honeybook is the biggest uh tool for um accounting for freelancer and independent and they have one and a half million visitors per month or visits per month. Last time someone corrected me so it's visit per month not visitors. So yeah, I thought this one at this point was uh for me like um a confirmation that we have here. So first of all let let's take uh a step back. We we know we are in a growing market. Uh the first thing we do when we educate ourself, we have some insight about the fact that freelancers and independent are probably the the less served, the less well served in this market. Then looking into the trend, we figure no it's not this one. We figure that the volume is good. The the trend is solid. Um so so far so good. and looking into the different actors and I didn't go further but I could have uh we find something like that which means it's a very big one and it's on it's on the homepage for independent professional um and we have a lot of traffic which means this is something we can go into then we have uh I'm just talking about this one because it's it was also interesting um I found this one which is online accounting made easy And it's free. No, it's not free. So, first thing I do is I ask JBT how are they making money and um it's a free web-based bookkeeping app aimed at freelancers and very small businesses. The core product is free forever. The company makes money from from small paid add-ons. So, I thought I mean first of all I I couldn't accept that it was free. So, I needed to figure out why. But I think it's a very good example of uh thinking outside the box and turning something that people expect to pay into something free and monetizing differently. And you can also monetize with affiliate things with with a lot of different things with education on the back end. But it's a I didn't make my video yet about business models that I really want to to do. But when starting a business, disrupting a category also means sometimes changing the business model. And this is what they did. They don't have a lot of traffic. So I don't think they're making a ton of money, but it's a very uh interesting approach. All right, let's move on to the next step. And for the next step, I used a subcategory deep dive prompt, which is a huge prompt that asks uh a deep research agent again as whatever the agent that you want to dig into this time a subcategory. So now we are only focusing on the freelancing the accounting softwares for freelancers and independent. So we don't look into the the rest and it it asks it to dig into the different competitors and the solutions that they're offering and how people are reacting, what people are complaining, what they what do they like, what don't they like um everything related to this subcategory. So in the end ultimately it will give a few opportunities based on all this research to build a tool that targets specifically um a certain category of people to help help them to achieve a certain result without a certain pain. So that's in the end what we want. It's like the the base of the business idea we can build on and again I'm not going to read the whole report but you can and and you can see also the different uh style of the the report and I'm just going to read quickly the different um statements of the opportunity I just mentioned that we got from this complete research and I actually like this one for growthminded freelancers and solopreneurs in the US and Europe. We are frustrated by the unreliability, complexity and punitive pricing of existing accounting softwares. Our product is a radically focused accounting tool that provides effortless financial clarity. Unlike competitors like QuickBooks, QuickBooks or openers that traps users in deadend system and zero or fresh book that gates essential feature like multicurrency support behind expensive bloated plan. Our solution delivers flawlessly executed essentials, income, expense trafficking, invoice and tax estimation on a scalable platform with transparent pricing and exceptional human support. This allow our user to save time, gain confidence in their finance and focus on growing their business without fear of outgrowing their tools. So that's is a little bit too much, but what I like is that this is one recommendation. So it's basically okay if you go in into this subcategory based on everything people are talking about related to using accounting software when you are an independent. This research ended up finding out that they are struggling with um the dead end system that gate feature essential feature multi like multicurrency basically they are overwhelmed by all these features they need to pay more and they don't use it and it's overwhelming. So the idea is to like minimalize the tool uh get the like the uh expense tracking uh invoicing tax estimation with transparent pricing that will stay the same and very good support and this just for freelancers. So it's could be a quite simple tool actually and when you decide to go for it then the next step will be to dig into the it's the marketing and then you will find out a lot of different quotes where people are expressing their pain points and then you can build your marketing upon that. But this is really the base uh of the idea. Everything that we have learned earlier ends up with that statement. Basically, you can read the other ones. Uh if you like, you can access this document. Uh the link is in the description. Uh so you can even click on each report if you want and link and read the whole report if you really want to to build this kind of tool. Uh but I think the the main value um is given already. Um to summarize, there is this huge map which is something I built, you know, by combining different blocks that is combining all the different problems that every company out there have and is willing to uh pay to pay someone to solve their problem. We pick only one, make sure it's growing. Then we educate ourself on the market. Then we start listing the subcategories. Then next step, we check the the demand for each subcategories and the relevancy for each category. We explore the ones we find the most promising and we look for indicators, clues that tells us okay there is a lot of demand here. there are um existing competitors. We can build something within this category that solves the the unsolved pains. Then we use the subcategory div prompt that then does the the market research specifically on this subcategory. Find out all the pain points and come up with different uh business ideas that are most likely to succeed. if executed correctly. And that's it for this video. I hope it was not confusing again and not too much uh at once. Let me know, please. Really let me know if you're still there. Please let me know in the comments what do you think about this type of videos because um I'm kind of testing out here. I'm mostly doing like educational content on how to validate your your idea, how to get customers, how to use AI to write marketing copies and funnels and but this is really like pure market research, finding business ideas. I think it's fun. Um, let me know in the comments if you enjoy it. Uh, and if so, what else would you like to see and what can I um uh change? what can I improve in this type of video recurs very last thing if you have uh an idea that is solid already or even if you already have a product that you started building uh you will find in the description the link to the voice mining framework which is another chain of prompts uh exactly like this but this time it is to help you to create all your marketing. So it will do the complete customer research for you, extract all the pain point and turn that into uh a very strong and good marketing copy. So if you at this point, do not hesitate. The link is in the description and otherwise then I see you in the next video. Bye-bye.
