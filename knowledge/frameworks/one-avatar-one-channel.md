# One Avatar, One Channel, One Product

> Focus on a single customer type, single acquisition channel, and single product until you hit $1M+.

## The Problem It Solves

Entrepreneurs spread thin across multiple avatars (customer types), channels (acquisition methods), and products feel perpetually busy but never break through. Every new variable decreases likelihood of success.

## The Framework

**To $1M+:**
- ONE avatar (customer type)
- ONE channel (acquisition method)
- ONE product (core offering)

**After $1M+:**
- Add complexity deliberately
- Each addition is a new "need-to-believe"

## Why It Works

> "Every single new assumption that we introduce dramatically decreases the likelihood that it occurs."

When you focus on one thing:
- All effort compounds on same problem
- Feedback loops are clearer
- You get good faster (volume + iteration)
- Easier to diagnose what's broken

## When To Apply

- Business under $1M revenue
- Feeling spread thin
- Multiple avatars or channels competing for attention
- Unclear which thing is actually working
