# AI Cost Collapse Economics

> AI infrastructure costs are falling 40x while capability grows, creating unprecedented economic arbitrage.

## The Numbers

- AI costs plummeting 40x in recent period
- Capability improving exponentially simultaneously
- Energy remains the binding constraint
- Hardware (NVIDIA) = new economic power center

## What This Means

### For Businesses
- Business models impossible last year are viable now
- Compute that cost $100K now costs $2.5K
- Entry barriers collapse across industries
- Speed of adoption is competitive advantage

### For Strategy
> "Nvidia has just become the central bank for AI, and they're minting their own currency, which is compute."

Hardware access = competitive moat. Those with compute advantage compound it.

## The Abundance Frame

> "If we really do expect to find ourselves in an abundant society soon, we should expect to have a lot of trillionaires in our society."

Cost collapse enables:
- Democratized access to AI capability
- New category of startups (impossible before)
- Fundamental restructuring of labor economics

## The Constraint

Energy, not capital or talent, limits AI scaling:
- Data centers require massive power
- SMRs, fusion, and solar innovation unlock next phase
- Geographic energy advantages become strategic

> "Once you have abundant energy, the whole economy becomes meaningless."
