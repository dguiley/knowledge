thets you can't you're just betting against the pool at in the pool at the racetrack you can only win or lose so much at a time and I you know it took me till I was 45 to blow through 25 years worth of earnings if I had an app on my phone at that time I can't tell you how dangerous that [Music] is Rex where does this podcast find you I'm in mini neapolis Minneapolis for the playoffs for the playoffs yeah that was nice so let's uh bust right into it uh we loved your Memoir it's hard for me to live with me can you tell us more about what led you to writing this and what you learned about yourself throughout the process o you've written books I'm not a writer Seth Davis uh terrific writer uh helped me with this he called me a few years ago actually four years ago and I think he seen me on a news spot with our friend Stephanie Rule and um you know I was just coming out of you know getting out of rehab for painkillers and had kind of uh gone off the rails a bit and Seth felt like you know maybe some of the things that I could tell uh and share might help some other people and you know we started in on it and it was a oh man it was a horrible process I I hated it Scott you know there would be times where we would talk every day and then I just couldn't talk about this stuff for you know a week or two I'd have to take a break so Seth hung in there with me and you know it was kind of hard to to talk about but I think I'm getting to the point where it's a bit cathartic it's been a process but yeah definitely a painful kind of uh experience so just for some context I think most people know you but for those of our listeners that don't Rex has struggled uh with addiction and um obviously had a big impact Kentucky basketball and the NBA but I think you're sort of having a bigger impact now and I thought of you seriously brex I I went on this podcast a guy named Rich R do You Know Rich yes I know of them and he was so moved by the community of recovery that he kind of I wouldn't say shaped his life around it but it's really sort of informed his Life View and I think that you're one of those people that that is being very raw about it and helps people or people can look at you and they can empathize tell us about and I want I apologize I'm going to go to a pretty dark place here but one of the things he said was so many people tried to intervene and it wasn't until I was ready that any of them could have any impact or help me did you have a similar experience and if so what was that moment and what catalyzed sort of where you could register recognize that you were ready to to get help Scott since I was little I was a a a horse racing fan and uh Gambler and my whole life I did that from the time I I would go to the track with my father when I was five or six years old and so I could read a racing form probably before I could read in school and uh so I had some issues uh but then I had the the painkiller issue and I had friends and family members telling me about the painkillers that you know I was ruining my life um you know that the gambling was ruining my life and I I think I was just so lost and prideful that I had just resigned myself that these pills were going to be part of me for the rest of my life I couldn't stop it was 14 years years from the time I finished playing until the time I went to rehab for the third time I was just broken at that point Scott and broke and it's easy not to gamble when you don't have any money so you know I I went to rehab and there was a a a moment in rehab the final time in 2014 where my it was family day and my kids came in and you know this this is the first time really in 14 years that I've felt anything I all my emotions had been numbed by pain medicine and they showed up and I was just a crying mess and but I promised them you know I was going to do my best to stay off these drugs and that I was going to be different and they all you know they were they ranged anywhere from 10 to 20 at the time and they were sitting there and my oldest daughter who was probably 18 I said I'm going to do my best to stay off these drugs and she said that's great what about the gambling and it was something in rehab we hadn't even really addressed yet but just had a little bit and my therapist was in the room at the time and when my daughter said that I wanted my first instinct was hey look at what I'm doing here I'm really trying and I looked at my therapist and she nodded at me like and I you in that moment I had to you know really admit no man you have a a gambling problem also and you have to attack you have to attack that it's interesting Rex I I don't I know you I don't know you well and I knew you were addicted to painkillers but I had no I didn't know about the gambling and my mom who was a dosent at a casino during her uh um retirement years the Bellagio she used to come home and tell me statistics about the hospitality industry and gaming and the statue told me that always blew me away is that the addiction with the highest SU suicide rate is gambling because when you're addicted to painkillers your family notices when you're an alcoholic people intervene they notice they may not they may not be able to help but you can get in so far over your head and no one knows was your addiction to painkillers in a weird way did that help surface another addiction before it got too out of control man you know I think I just my whole life I probably just traded one addiction for another going back I cuz I didn't drink I I did drink and I didn't smoke I I felt like for I think I knew deep down that you know I have a lot of that in my family and I felt like if both sides my My Father's Side gambled my my mother's side you know a lot of mental illness probably both sides was Mental Illness but um alcohol and and drugs and whatnot so I think I was always just very scared that I would like that and I I stayed away from it and I think therefore I kind of Justified going to the track I'm not hurting anybody but myself you know I'm going to the track or I'm going to be I might not go to the track for months but I'm playing golf every day for nine hours when I should be spending some of that time at home you know uh chasing girls I would just trade one you know distraction for another to keep you know probably to keep me from thinking about all the [ __ ] that was going on in my life and the hardest part for me Scott really and truly over the past eight or nine years hasn't been staying off the medicine um it it's been sitting learning to sit in my bad feelings and not run not get a pain pill or run to the track and spend 7even hours there in a racing form thinking of nothing else um that has been something I didn't have any coping skills for anything I was going through my whole life until really I entered rehab for the last time at age 45 or six and this is a I don't know an odd obtuse question so I apologize in advance if it comes out um un feeling or incorrectly I look at you now you're a big handsome guy that's probably making really good money covering Sports your family seems to and I don't know this but I'm going to assume they've forgiven you and they just want you to be happy you look like you're really healthy I mean you you kind of like you're the guy that most of just want to be Rex right here and now well anyways it's I don't know what the reality is but that's perception yeah thank you and when you're sitting there and you're thinking like you got to fight back these bad feelings that you kind of naturally have an inclination to medicate with whatever what are those bad feelings are is a depression that you did is chemical that you just bad thoughts is it guilt over what happened what what are those if you're comfortable sharing what are those bad feelings yeah uh so no it's that's a great question um you know since I was young Scott I I can imagine worst case scenarios I always kind of always felt like the the the sky is falling and for no reason I learned that that's anxiety and I have dealt with it my whole life I purposely made myself throw up before every game I played until I was 20 probably 23 years old grade school high school college NBA 82 games a year in the NBA so I couldn't continue that but um I did that it was anxiety the second I threw up I felt great um my dad did it I watched him do it Bill Russell used to do it didn't he didn't a lot of famous players do it yeah athletes are are weird but again that's not that's not super healthy and you know so anxiety I I did you know looking back when late High School especially College depression I was sleeping a lot um again I just thought well I'm getting my rest I'm not out partying no I was sleeping I was just I was depressed and something I couldn't talk to people about or didn't feel like I could talk to people about um so I my my brain just I felt like it's always running hot like I just can't sit still add of course and you know I'm a bit dyslexic so and stuff that I never knew stuff that like that that you know kind of soured me on school I kind of thought well look why why can everybody in this room read that as fast as as one another I can't read that as fast I comprehend it but I can't read it teleprompter same way so I dealt with a lot of insecurity and deal with a lot of insecurity but I yeah I think that you know just I'm a I'm a mess in some ways and when you said you know we look at you as the guy man Scott that's how I look at you that's how I look at the guy standing down on the street corner I'm like man I bet he's got it all together you know uh and of course that's not true not every everybody does have it together we're all just walking around with these thoughts in our heads and you know it's better if we can all get along and listen to one another and if there was one or two we all have our people who have not struggled with addiction we all have our perception our mythology around what recovery looks like what was the most surprising things about what worked or what didn't work like if you were to say these are the two things surprises to the upside or the downside that people don't understand about recovery and what it means to come out the other end sober man I I honestly think at this point that being in therapy and I I talk I find myself talking about it you know people will ask me a question and it might not have anything to do with rehab or recovery but I'll draw on an experience that I had in rehab a story that somebody will tell that someone told and before I know it I'm in a conversation with somebody else and they're telling me something about themselves being vulnerable and it's weird but it's pretty cool cuz guys like you and I didn't used to DARE talk like this we might we might if we were really good friends talk about it in private but even then you wouldn't really you know kind of get to the bottom of whatever it is you're dealing with the therapist part for me has been huge absolutely huge um you know I didn't I didn't trust anybody I didn't trust people well enough to tell complete strangers what was going on with me and when I look back man I was just so silly for doing that just so prideful and like you said some of the stuff is guilt some of it is shame you know for things that I've done things that I've said things that that I've you know thought you know but but the guilt and shame part of doing this publicly to my kids and my ex-wife and my family my mom and dad my family and friends my friends's children who idolized me I or idolized me you know I thought at that point I was so broken but I remember thinking you know I've got to try to you know regain some of this in my life and uh try to do better and and regain the trust of all these people I've let down there's no elegant way to Pivot to the future of sports try and do it um you've been in you've kind of seen Sports from a lot of different angles right ranging from a high school athlete to a NBA star to someone who's advising NBA teams commentating on them I'm curious when you look at the ecosystem of sports what what do you see in terms of big trends or how things have changed or is there anything that people aren't seeing it's such an enormous industry right now it has so much speculation and people talking about it so much but what what do you see that are that's changing about the World of Sport you know when we were growing up it seemed like you know the the media was pretty fair with the players you talked about their wins and losses and the the the streaks that they were on and he's playing well and he's not playing well and he's hurt and he's not hurt it's almost like sports media has become like the worst parts of Twitter or it's it's that that's the you mean the sewage system of the sewage system it's that bad yeah you have to have a hot take about everything and you can't there's no way to have a hot take about everything you have to agree on some things some things are obvious when you watch a game but anymore you've got one person sitting there I'll take this side you take the other side and it's ridiculous and I I think it's you know athletes are pretty weird anyway but uh I think what we're seeing is you know you see a lot more athletes that are terrified of the media that don't want to talk to the media that want to go on their boy podcast or their own podcast and get their message out to be honest if I could have done that way back when I would have probably done I just feel like and with sports now we have you know the gambling Scott and I'm not going to sit up here and I was not a sports Gambler I've never bet on a a game uh a team sport in my life I was strictly thoroughbreds and blackjack and and craps and all that stuff it's super dangerous I'm so glad to hear you say that it's it's the fastest growing industry outside of AI right now here here's what I'll tell you I I blew through you know between divorce but mostly gambling blew through some $40 million uh in my career thorough breads now you can't you're just betting against the pool at in the pool at the racetrack you can only win or lose so much at a time and I you know it took me till I was 45 to blow through 25 5 years worth of earnings if I would have had an app on my phone cuz for years I would have to have I lived in Kentucky New York Racing Association had a a wagering account a phone wagering account in the 90s I got a New York Racing Association account I would call I would have to talk to a person hey give me $200 to win on the six at Aqueduct uh I'd have to do that it it was time consuming if you ran out of money you had to uh send a cashier check snail mail all that stuff if I had an app on my phone at that time where I make a bet and oh I'm out of money and I can just go boop boop here you go put in another $2,500 I can't tell you how dangerous that is and for addicts especially gambling addicts you can't stop and and you'll bet on anything at any at some point where it's just about the action and the most confounding thing for me when I look back is what the what was I doing like I would take 15 grand to the track and if I won some let's say I won 15 grand or 30 grand that wasn't going to change my life it wasn't I was making whatever playing basketball but if I do that long enough it will change my life for the worst cuz I'm going to lose you know I would you lose more more days than you win uh and once you start chasing the money it's a wrap and that's what I would do you know you get down you start play all these games in your head with the math and you start chasing money and you leave the track and you're cussing at yourself and you're throwing things and all that and guess what got more races the next day let's go back and get them that's that's the mind an addict a gambling addict I think yeah it's just um I just can't what you say about gambling and friction my Jun my roommate my junior in college at UCLA was a gambling addict and this really shady guy would show up once a week and take like a hundred bucks from them and I'm like and I was clear oh that's the bookie it was so shady it was so weird that I was never tempted to gamble but I've got Kevin Hart and Charles Barkley endorsing something and then I just I'm it's on my phone and I for whatever reason I think I have insight into Arsenal playing byon Munich CU you know I understand football better than most people and why not make the game a little bit more fun get that dopa hit and if it was on I agree with you so much and I think you'd be such a wonderful spokesperson here I think online gaming is a [ __ ] train wreck for young men yeah it's and imagine Scott you know we went to college and you're you're going I didn't drink in college but all my friends did you know who I grew up with they drank they partied they did all that stuff imagine going to college now and you know I remember fraternity Brothers you know playing cards and gambling with cards I can't imagine the young people out there right now you know you're with your boys and you're drinking and you're smoking and you're having fun you're a CO young college kid let's bet on the game yeah let's bet on the game it wasn't an option you know when we were growing up not legally anyway and now it's legal you talk about Charles well all of the you know and I go way back with Charles we're longtime golf buddies seems like a good guy I want to be clear strikes me as a good guy the league the leagues and uh the players we used to be warned at the beginning of the year you'd have the same same group go around to 30 NBA teams and tell them you don't they put up on the wall behind you pictures This Guy's in in Miami this guy's in New York this guy's in Chicago do not associate with these people these are known gamblers their known bookies you know don't associate with them and so it was a no no everybody knew gambling sports betting uh hell you know they would what are you guys doing knowing the line why would you know the line like it was a no no and now because gambling money is figured into the collective bargaining agreement and the owners get a cut and the players get a cut and the salaries have exploded it kind of goes hand in hand we've already seen a couple of instances Shi Otani and his translator in baseball who gambled away not Shi didn't apparently but his translator gamble stole and gambled away millions of dollars and bet with them we just saw a guy named jonte Porter in the NBA a marginal NBA player who was betting on himself um betting on his team to lose uh and now has been banned for life from the NBA for gaming and this is an NBA player imagine Scott imagine imagine small college players who can gamble on their own games under the radar or think that they can gamble on their own own games under the radar that aren't making any money it's it's a time bomb my opinion we'll be right back I'm I'm just a I thought of you when I was thinking about college athletes and pay I'm curious to get your view on whether or not College athletes should be compensated yes they should um now I'm not saying it's it's easy but yeah I I'm mentioned in my book that you know I was paid um under the table like so many top players in college um you know bought me a car and all of this stuff is was illegal way back when um they've established the nil now which name image and likeness um where you can go and make money off of your name image and likeness when I went to the University of Kentucky in 1986 I signed away my name image and likeness to the university and they've had that until just recently at obannon I went to school of the oanon brothers and he changed that right or everything for us they they did um so yes but it's not an easy answer you're these are young people now they're going to have to pay taxes but that's a good thing letting these teaching these kid I got into the NBA and got my my first check gross 50,000 net 33 I turned to my teammates I was 19 20 years old and said I've heard about tax returns when do we get this back and they said what and I said yeah when do we get this money back I said you can't be this dumb we don't get that money back I didn't know but now you know kids are making money and you have to pay taxes on it in in college you better be taking a finance class or you the school better be teaching you a little bit of financial literacy I didn't have any most most players come from nothing most Pro players come from nothing and have no fiscal responsibility at all and hopefully now with niil coming along some adults will make sure that these players just don't go willy-nilly through life knowing nothing about the money they're making say in the eth grade you didn't hit a growth spurt and you ended up being four or five in shorter and just you could be on the JV team in high school maybe Varsity for a couple years but absolutely no college prospects and you knew early that Sports aren't going to be an option for you do you think your struggles with addiction would have been the same better or worse I think probably worse uh yeah yeah I I Scott I didn't have any ambition other than that I didn't have any Ambi ambition other than playing sports um you know if you'd ask me what do you think you'd be doing you know it would be something like coaching basketball you know be something in you know where I grew up in Owensboro Kentucky you played Sports and went to school and when school for most of my buddies you know they played just as much and were worked just as hard as I did Growing Up you know when school when our High School season ended their basketball careers ended for the most of them and those guys struggled you know they went to college and now they're you know they've been playing basketball with me every day what do I do now and if I would have been in that same position with them oh my God I can only imagine I would have run off the rails cuz I would have been I'm sure at 18 years old not knowing how to uh spend my time I've been doing this for ever I'm sure I would have not sure but I can definitely see myself partying and being the guy that can't stop partying so I think that always was kind of in the back of my mind that you know look man you need to stay away from this or you'll be a you'll be a big train wreck and it happened anyway but at least I was able to to get my career in there before that took over and what you have kids what what advice would you give to parents or around kids in sports and competitive Sports you know uh another really good question I my dad left me alone and maybe to the point of too much I never was my dad coached and I was on I watch his practices all the time and if I wanted to know something he would tell me but he didn't push me and I liked that that he cuz I saw so many other parents just involved in their kids stuff to the point and you know I could tell that I was better maybe considerably better and I see these kids working and going their their parents are getting pissed off at them because they don't want to go to the gym or they're not doing this well enough or that well enough and I saw so many kids flame out by the time they were in ninth grade 10th grade CU it was no fun anymore cuz their parents made it no fun and I think the one thing that I've been able to to see is that you know kids are going to come across this at their own pace you know if you push a kid into something or if you tell a kid they can't do something well they're going to want to do that and you know you can't you just can't live your life you know through your kids and their Sports and what they do you can be there for them root them on but you know being obsessed with them becoming a a a division one athlete or a pro athlete it's really hard to do and the odds are that somehow some way they're not going to make it there so you know uh I think you just have to be really really careful pushing your kids into sports I got to ask you or I got to imagine that everyone from the Phoenix Suns to the league itself when they think who do we want to come speak to the rookie class I got to think you're on everyone's short list so I'm going to assume that's the case but they don't give you much time they say directs we got to get back to practice you got 10 you know what are the cliff notes on what you tell I mean I feel like the thing that was struck me about these athletes I always felt like they're children I was a child when I was that age I was a child I couldn't have handled the media the pressure the money the The Temptations the the the the maturity when you don't get started I I I mean I just wouldn't wasn't enough of a man to deal with what these boys have to deal with what if any or what what are the key points of advice you give to these young men as they're trying to you know start a career in professional sports yeah you know Scott um you have these meetings drug meetings gambling meetings um with with the league you know they'll come in they'll talk to every team throughout the years and uh I was the guy that was sitting in those meetings and those meetings are mandatory like you have to be there but they only get get like 45 minutes or an hour and I was the one sitting over in the corner looking at my watch pointing to R GM or whoever it is going they got five more minutes and I'm out of here and like gonna walk out was I got to go play golf y'all don't you know you've taken up enough of my time sat there and didn't didn't listen to much of anything that was said don't be that guy is what I tell them is you know every player every athlete is one step away one wrong step away from never playing again ever and if you haven't prepared your life or prepared enough for what life's going to be like once you finish playing you're going to struggle because you're going to fill that void with something that's probably not constructive and you also have to think about this Scott I know you can you talked about dopamine and endorphins earlier I grew up playing basketball from age five and so by age 15 I've made enough game winners to last a lifetime for most people and when you do that in practice in games and you start doing it in front of fans um you don't realize it but that's a rush there's a real Rush that goes along with it and you kind of It kind of becomes old hat after a while but then you do it in high school and college and in the NBA and it becomes kind of something you do and you do it every single day well when that's over it's really over you're never that's a rush you're never getting back how you going to feel it for me I filled it with painkillers and I filled it with going to the track and getting a horse to get up in the final jumps to get that rush you know it's uh unless you're prepared for the end of your career and I my good buddy John Lucas always says you know who struggled with addiction uh forever and was the number one pick in the draft in like 1972 he said every athlete dies twice at the end of their careers and at the end of life and you have to be prepared for that and I certainly was not prepared for that and advice not to not to NBA players but advice to other dads that have have struggled with their own stuff man your kids are always watching they're always watching and um I'll tell this one little story that's in the book um but my son was about 10 years old and he was in the car with me and you know I would go to the track every day and so I had bad tickets T losing tickets that I would have everywhere in the car and the cubby hole and whatever I had walked into the store I said all right I got to go pay for gas e I'll be right back left my son in the car he's sitting right outside and I went inside paid for gas came back out put the gas in the car and at right at that time he was really getting into you know math second third grade and whatnot and I came back out in the car and he was so proud of proud of himself he had gone through my bad gambling tickets and realized that the number uh that I had lost was around $30,000 for that day or whatever it was and I just remember getting in the car he was so proud that he added all this up he didn't even know what he was doing didn't know those were gambling losses and I just remember feeling like the worst the worst father in the world for for doing that to my kids um exposing them to to that and then the worst part of it was I couldn't stop I just couldn't stop and so you know I think I went deeper into a hole so the kids are always watching just know it even if they're little and at some point you know fast forward eight or nine years and there's my daughter telling me dad what about the gambling you got a gambling problem they're always watching so be mindful so as someone who is entirely does lacks the credentials nor the domain expertise or even the relationship with you to say this I'm going to say it anyways I I wish you'd forgive yourself I just feel so much pain and guilt and I just got to imagine you're you're this Larger than Life character with great skills you make other people feel good I got to think your kids and everyone around you just want you to forgive yourself and be happy thanks buddy I I I do struggle with it but you know in their times that I go through there time there are times that I I'll feel good about you know kind of where I am and what I've done but then that that doubt creeps back in I think that I think for me Scott it's just a once you've run your life off the rails or once I did anyway I just go man I didn't even know I had that capability and now that I know I can do that it scares the [ __ ] out of me it just does and so I'm cautious I continue to try to stay you know um with my you know on my therapy and uh you know I have friends that have keys to my place in case I want to spend the sleeping they can come get me and you know go do things so I've got safeguards in place but life's hard you know it is life's just hard it's hard for everyone and um you know I'm doing the best I can with it and I can't tell you Scott how much those words mean to me they really do don't think I'm just saying that I know that there are people out there pulling for me I hope that you know I do get to a point where you know I I've accepted you know kind of where I am and what what I've done and all that but it's still a process at this point Rex Chapman is considered by many the greatest basketball player ever produced by the state of Kentucky in two years at the University of Kentucky he scored over a thousand points led the wild cats to a sweet 16 appearance and was nicknamed King Rex he then spent 12 seasons in the NBA he currently hosts the smartless podcast owned and his Memoir co-authored with Seth Davis it's hard for me to live with me is out now he joins us from his home in Phoenix Rex there are two different stories there's an athlete who's incredible who inspires people goes on to live a good productive life and then there's an athlete who's incredible inspires people struggles has a fall and then comes back and helps other people going through the same thing one of those lives is Meaningful the other is profound you my brother are leading a profound life you're helping people I really I mean this sincerely I wish you the best and I hope that you register that you're helping other people thanks Scot I really can't thank you that [Music]
