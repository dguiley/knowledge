give us the journey around uh coconut water is I'm a terrible operator following piggybacking off of that model where like wow I can come up with an idea and partner with a company that has an expertise and I could just be a marketing arm for them I want a Coca-Cola with this idea for coconut water and a [Music] PowerPoint Jesse where does this podcast find you uh Atlanta Georgia where I live Atlant kind of nice um so let's bust right into it uh give us your kind of origin story Jesse walk us through your background and how you ended up doing what you've done I've had a very unconventional journey and worn a lot of different hats I started out in the music business right out of college I went to school in DC at American University I was signed to a record label called delicious vinyl and um that didn't go great for me I ended up getting dropped from the label and I started doing theme songs for sports teams like the Nick theme song which called go New York go bunch of other teams and ultimately started a like a music marketing company that I sold to a public company and then um I'm a big Runner I've done a lot of longdistance ultra races and when I was training for 100 mile race I discovered coconut water in 2006 s ended up partnering with a a coconut water company called ziko which we sold to Coke cocacola and then just had a bunch of wrote a book had four kids got married moved from New York to Atlanta and really just followed things that I love to do and launched a bunch of businesses some worked and some didn't and here I am so let's go through let's go through the businesses what what was sort of your approach to starting businesses which ones worked which ones didn't and if you could draw a line through or try and find signal from the noise in terms of why companies worked or didn't work what would that signal be well jumping right to that point I think at the end of the day usually for me it's come down to management and that's not me hiring people that could take my idea and bring it to fruition I think the best idea is if they don't have good leaders and good managers will struggle and you know Scott I really enjoyed my 20s man I I tried a a lot of different things I slept on 18 different couches from 18 to 22 different friends putting me up going couch to couch trying different businesses I called I sold carrot and celery sticks door too I was a kidy pool attendant I cleaned pools I sold meat chicken and uh door to door I just tried so many different things when I was 28 years old I was a guest on a private jet and when I walked onto the private jet it was like the scene in The Wizard of Oz when everything in life goes from black and white to color and I was like people fly like this this is insane I want to fly like this and that's how we got the idea to start this company called Mark key jet I think a lot of the businesses that I've been involved with some which worked many more which didn't work entrepreneurs can do two things they can make something better or they can create something new and there were all all the businesses that I've been involved with were a function of just identifying things that fit one of those two categories you like wow like I'm a runner I would love what's the natural healthy way to get electric like coconut water emerged through necessity and need and just keeping my eyes open for things that would make my life easier or better and that's how those ideas popped into my head so talk about Marquee Chad what what gave you the vision I mean it's not easy to just start a explain the concept how it differentiated from other fractional companies are owning a plane and what was your niche in the marketplace and walk us through kind of what happened there yeah well at the time that we started this company which is in around the year 2000 99 2000 there were really only three ways to fly privately you could buy your own airplane which was incredibly expensive you could Charter a plane with there are a lot of inconsistencies who's flying the airplane how old is the airplane who's managing the airplane or you could buy a fraction of an airplane which also is a long-term commitment and a lot of money that's what netjets was doing and flexjet and other fractional jet companies and I couldn't afford any of those options and they weren't realistic for me I wanted to take two or three flight a year with some friends treat my parents maybe a business trip so our idea was a 25h hour basically debit card you prepaid for 25 hours put like 50 or 100 Grand down for 25 hours and if you fly to you have 23 hours left you didn't have to own the airplane the plane was available on short notice and we you're right we had no Aviation experience and we had no airplanes and we had no money but we went to the 800 PB gorilla Net Jets which had 650 cles the largest private jet Fleet in the world and owned by Warren Buffett and we pitched them this idea of a 25 hour jet card and because we needed airplanes and they the CEO Rich santulli threw my partner and I out of that meeting in 12 minutes and literally said if you think I'm giving two 28- year old kids who didn't break probably didn't break a thousand on their SATs access to my planes that's not going to happen and kicked us out and the president grabbed us and said you know wait a second I think there's something here I want you guys to come back and repitch this next week I'm going to set up a follow-up meeting I want I want to hear more we came back a week later and we brought in our own focus group and we literally set up eight chairs in the boardroom and one by one eight people a re powerful Real Estate Mogul from New York a sports agent they stood up and said they would never buy a fraction but they would buy a 25-hour jet card and ultimately we got we got a deal to use their planes and put our program under the netet fleet so our Niche was you know was catering to an audience that couldn't have afford to buy their own plane we made private Aviation more affordable to the masses and it worked net I would think would want to do it in hopes that they could get people addicted to this and then move them up to fractional is that accurate that's 100% accurate we were a marketing arm and yes we were a farm system for their larger fractional program and so tell me about the industry now in terms of fractional how would you differentiate between kind of give us a lay of the land and how the market that business is evolved and eventually bur netjets uh bought you out correct yeah so I've been out of it for almost 13 years now so I don't follow the industry super close I'm just a customer but I know a lot it's really it's a really difficult Capital intensive business Scott I think when we started there were like 50 companies that put a flag in the ground that said they were in the private jet space and like two were profitable it's a really hard business to survive in netjets had the had the luxury of having you know being backed by birkshire so they built an incredible infrastructure but now you know 13 years later I'm not 100% sure how it's evolved but it's a lot of the same it's still kind of buy your own plane travel you know buy a fraction of a plane Charter or or some kind of card or oneoff program and give us the journey around uh coconut water so my models I'm not a great operator I know what my weakness is I'm a terrible operator a much better marketer idea guy and following piggybacking off of that model where like wow I can come up with an idea and partner with a company that has an expertise and I could just be a marketing arm for them I went to Coca-Cola with this idea for coconut and a PowerPoint and said I want to get to the coconut water business at this time it was a very very small category and beverage and they said we see this as an evolving area but we don't buy PowerPoints but if you find an existing company out there that's proven that they can Source the product sell the product they're on the shells Etc and you come in to help Market it we love to be in business with you so we went to a company called ziko coconut order that was doing about $2 or3 million maybe a little bit more in sales at the time and we did a three-way deal my group my company sea which existed in Coca-Cola and Koke had an option to buy a 100% of the company down the road and two years later they executed that option so we got it really hot really fast and we did that through PR through um we had a lot of celebrity invest ERS the old model in beverage was we're going to pay people as endorsers but the customers consumers pretty smart now and they they see that our model was write us a check be an investor Mr and Mrs celebrity and help us promoted as a as an owner of the company and that model worked and now a lot of you know a lot of companies have followed suit off of that model I like the way that you define or you view success and luck what has been your approach to putting yourself in situations where luck can find you well I think as an entrepreneur a big part of it is luck great I've been super lucky and probably way more lucky than good but I put myself in situations where I can attract that luck I used to come home Scott from like you know I walk into Mary Jet and I'd be like I got a sale last night we had a bell I would ring the bell they like what do you me you at the bar same bar I was at I'm like yeah but you left at 11:00 I stay till 2 and I got the sale oh you're so lucky the guy came I was I'm not lucky I put myself in that situation you know luck doesn't happen Sunday night watching the Kardashians on your couch it happens when you put yourself in an environment where the universe can reward you for being there and then you have to be good at what you do and take advantage of it so my 20s and 30s were built around putting myself in environments where I could get lucky so you do these Ultram man competitions which I are incredible Feats of endurance and I wrote crew and I think one of the things that's put me in a position of success is that you know and as I'm sure I can't even I can't even imagine what it's like to to run these distances or Swim these distances but in crew it's basically who can endure the most pain I mean there's some technique there's some strength there's some Fitness but it's mostly an exercise and who's willing to endure the most pain and I've always thought that an enormous Advantage for an entrepreneur that that when you think things couldn't get any worse and you just can't handle it anymore what you learn I would imagine in the in the in the Ultram man and what I learned at crew is that when you think that it means you're about a third of the way to your limit and always gave me a sense of comfort and confidence that I could keep going I'm curious what you think the relationship is between kind of what I'll call Extreme Fitness or extreme sports in entrepreneurship in 2006 I ran my first 100 mile race and when I came back after that race I got my my office together and I said double the business plan the correlation I mean when you do something like that you realize that the limits that we put on oursel are pretty much self-imposed and we have so much more in the tank than we thought we could I mean I started out running two miles that was my goal and nothing changed on my body I I'm still the same leg same build I'm not super strong nothing changed the only only thing that changed is I saw someone run a 100 mile race I went to watch a 100 mile race in 2006 and there weren't a bunch of Superman that started at the at the starting line people in fact weren't even that physically impressive but what happened was they didn't stop they didn't they just didn't stop and I was like oh wow this is a test of will this is just will sign me up for this race and let me see how much will I have and when I did the first 100 mile race it changed everything in my life as it relates to entrepreneurship now for starters we talked about Marquee jet briefly but if they would have said to me I was a kidy pool attendant five years before I started Marquee jet I worked at a freaking Kitty pool man and five years later we had this company that's doing five billion in sales and if they would have said to me when I started Marquee jet you need Department of Transportation approval you need FAA approval you're going to build a sales team raise money I I would have been like what I said what's the first thing Scott you said I needed Department of Transportation approval there's got to be a lawyer that does that let me find that guy okay we got what's the second thing I need FAA approval and I broke it down into digestible bites it's the same thing with 100 mile race or the Ultram man or even I'm sure when you race crew going like flag pole to flag pole or tree to tree you know you break it down into digestible bites so there's a lot of similarities between how you approach a race like that and how you approach a startup business especially if you have no entrepreneurial experience my dad owned the plumbing supply house we never talked about business there was no you know I had to kind of help figure it out and and navigate it on my own which actually became a blessing because it meant that I would do things differently than other people we'll be right back you talk about the buckets of Rich that you believe in and I love that term buckets of Rich time Rich socially Rich spiritually Rich intellectually Rich purposefully Rich physically rich and Adventure Rich can you walk us through those yeah there's an old acronym that they use is my parents were getting older I did a lot of research around senior facilities but I'm going to send my parents to a senior facility and I stumbled upon uh an acronym that one of the centers use called sibs and it stands for social in ual physical purposeful and spiritual and what struck me is so interesting about that is that they didn't talk about Instagram followers how many do you have a watch the watch you wear a c like Financial wasn't even a category and they're grading your overall like H the most important thing your health you know your Wellness your happiness so I started to like think about my own circle of friends and people that are wealthy or and and even myself and like what what are those buckets that I value the most and they're the ones that you just said like you know you can have all the money in the world but if you're not Tim Rich how you you know having the freedom to do what you want to do or spiritually rich or you know then there's an emptiness to your wealth so that's sort of how I started to think about it you know I I invest a lot in how I spend my time how I plan how I think about time being as good as I can be in the buckets that matter the most to me is a really good way for me to measure my success you know my family I have four kids my friends my relation my business my Wellness Etc how am I doing in those buckets what do you think about I've always I like the saying you can have it all you just can't have it all at once because the time bucket I found or at least I found that if I wanted to have the money bucket full at some point I'd have to sacrifice the time bucket that I'd have to pretty much go all in on work for a certain amount of time that certain buckets were just going to know what the term is run run especially full or especially empty you know I was never able to really strike a balance as a younger man and Achieve any level of success I I know those people existed I wasn't one of them I found I had to go all in on something or it just didn't work and and it came at a price you know it came at a price to my relationships so wasn't you know I was worked out but I probably wasn't as fit as I could have been or healthy as I could have been but now I have a lot of that balance I have a thesis and that is young people think they can have it all and I I just don't think that's true what are your thoughts about trying to manage balance at a young age and you know all of these different buckets that sometimes are in in opposition with each other well it's an individual decision I think and it it varies depending in my opinion based on your age so I think that I believed it was important to have your 20s I saw a lot of my friends go from 20 to 50 like that because they were working on Wall Street in front of a computer all day it they were sacrificing like they gave up their 20s you know your 20s are a time to try as many things as you can and see what you like to do and see what you're good at and then you know and then Master it in your 30s and get rich in your 40s you're going to make five to 10 times as much money most people in their 40s and 50s than you will in your 20s there's exceptions to R but because you're going to be smarter you're going to know more people you're G to be better at what you do and I think a lot of people see on social media people getting wealthy quickly and think like well that's their story you know and you can't compare yourself to that there are people that do that but I remember going to Coca-Cola in my 20s with on the ziko meeting and the president a Coke said to me it's going to take eight years to build this brand it takes eight years to build a brand in this country I always remembered that and it's gotten sped up a little now with the internet and everything but it takes time so I think look balance is tough you always go I wasn't in Balance when I ran my ultramarathon I was training you go in and out of balance but that sacrifice and what you're willing to give up is important to remember you don't get your 20s back you don't get your 30 back you don't get your your kids growing up back I have four kids now that are all under the age of 14 so I'm going through this right now how much time do I want to spend at work and how much time do I want to spend with my kids what do do you have any sort of guideposts as a dad to try and make sure that you I mean because I'm telling you those your kids you're you're in the golden decade right now you're in the midst those are the literally the best years and everybody says that they're they're all great but I don't buy that I think some years are better than others and you're in what I'd call The Golden decade sort of 4 to 14 and I sort of knew it I mostly knew it but I wish I'd known it more and it imposed more rules on myself do you impose any sort of rules other than trying to spend time with them yeah I have a rule I'm never too tired for my kids so if my kids want if I come home and my kids want to have a baseball catch and I'm exhausted I'm still having the baseball catch because if I'm too tired when my kids want me then my work life balance is way out of a waack so rule number one for me is I'm never too tired for my kids I have a lot of a lot of rules I mean a new one that I just did is nothing to do with time but when my kids come into my room if I'm on my phone this is my office my phone is my office I don't go to an office this is my office so when my kids come in if I'm on my phone I would the old me would say I would say um give me one second guys let me just finish this up the new me puts my phone down so kids know that they're more important than my phone so that's been a big switch I have a lot of guard rails around when I use my phone so phone time at home and all that said my kids also know that Mommy comes first like I've been told my whole life your kids are the most kids come first they don't like Mommy and Daddy have to be right or nothing's right so you know it's important for Sarah my wife and I for our kids to know like you know Mommy and Daddy come first and then I'm a big show don't tell you know like I include my kids we have family dinners as much as we can we don't say we're gonna do it four times a week or as often as we humanly possibly can we have family dinners and we talk about a lot of things we try to expose our kids to a lot of things and we ask them to share a lot of things we have family meetings once a week so we invest a lot in the family unit can you describe if it's not too personal I I love the idea of a family meeting but I'm not entirely sure how what's supposed to happen I'm just curious give us a sense of what happens in your family meeting yeah so we get together and on Sundays and it's short and we just talk about something like one thing that happened to us this week so somebody you know in school I failed at this I did this I succeeded in this um if we have anything that we want to talk about like summer PL or goals or whatever will bring it up it's a chance for everybody to kind of share get up to speed and like communicate um in a group setting sometimes a vote if it's like hey you know we're thinking about going on a trip this year what you know that kind of stuff gets discussed you know what it does Scott it allows everybody to be heard I actually like it and I'm not a great communicator so for me it's not it's kind of challenging but the other that we have is when we have guests at our dinner table each of the kids has to ask the guest a question about them so it gives them a chance to practice their what I think is the most important thing which is communication and public speaking so that's another kind of rule that we have so we' talked a little bit about fathering what advice would you give to a young man who's just entering into a relationship and thinking about getting married what what do you know now that you wish you'd known earlier in your marriage marriage well in my marriage before I got married we never talked about what do we want to feed our kids do we want our kids to go to Temple or church or our relig like what does religion come into play and um you know where do we want our kids to go to school private school public school how are we going to you know discipline our kids what's our philosophy on discipline like that never crossed my mind to talk to Sarah about until we had kids you have have to eat I eat super healthy Sarah eats like the other end of the spectrum how do you want to raise our kids so like we never had those conversations and so that's it's just something to think about if you're getting married like how aligned are you on certain things and definitely how align are you on on your values or whatever as far as parenting you know we try to um praise the effort as much as we can and not the result so Charlie you know not oh you scored three touchdowns but like I love watching how hard you work on the field like it's just I love how how much you know how you hustle today praising the effort is a big thing we try to expose our kids to as many life experiences different people as we can and so you it sounds like you have a a healthy relationship with your partner good kids you've obviously checked a lot of box as an entrepreneur what what what's left for you what are you working on if you look out 10 years and you think this is really what I what I've like to have done or accomplished that I haven't done or accomplished already what what is that or those things feel like I'm finally at 55 I'm turning 56 in August in the right lane I do a lot ofing and coaching and and I like it I feel like I'm good at it um I have a lot of experiences to share and I just share my experience is in business and being a dad all that stuff but I also feel like I haven't I never really even talked about this but I feel like I haven't really figured out exactly like what like that big thing I'm so I've Done big things but the big thing I'm supposed to do to really contribute like to the world I don't think I've even hit that yet so I I my eyes are always open for it I just don't I don't know I lost my dad my mom and my sister in the last two years so it's changed my perspective a lot on a lot of different things you know like what just like what matters the most to me when my mom my mom died a month ago and the night she uh my sister had been living with at my with my mom because uh my dad when my dad died my sister moved into her house with and she would walk her to bed every night and the night of Mother's Day um on the way to going to bed at like 11:00 my sister my mom stopped my sister and said um her name is Jan my sister said Jan get the nicest glass glass wear that we have and get a bottle of champagne so my sister got the glass you like the nicest glasses in my mom's house they poured a glass of champagne and they made my mother's even drank they made a toast and she never woke up so it's like she like basically toasted her life on the last night of her life which is amazing but I think like when I think back to that like to live a life that you can toast I don't know what I'm going to do in 10 years I have no idea but if I had the the last glass of champagne tonight I mean I'm toasting to an insanely amazing life already so you know it can only get better I think but I don't I don't know what that looks like for me it's a nice way to go it's it's unusual it's as if your mother knew that that was it yeah it was it was Unreal and having experienced that kind of loss in such a short concentrated time period has it I mean obviously it's got an impacted you emotionally but has it impacted you in terms of how you approach relationships or what you're thinking about professionally or how you spend your time yeah I mean I've always been good with spending my time like I said I invest a lot in planning for like I I plan most of my year in advance I had this big calendar I put as much as the things that I want to do in advance before I plan my work I plan my life trips races blah blah blah blah one-on-one trips with my kids so like and then I just kind of Follow The Script but I think that what's changed is just a lot of the small things that I used to like really spend a lot of energy on I just bounce off me and if you could give your 25-year-old self you know say had maybe 15 or 30 seconds with them right you find the time machine that's the good news the bad news is you have 15 or 30 seconds with your 25-year-old self what would you say to him I would probably say a quote that Gandhi had that I I I live by which is um learn like you'll live forever and live like you'll die tomorrow I would tell my 25y old self to like learn experience as much as you can do as many things as you can with the hope that those experiences will help you all the way down the the line but o live like you'll die tomorrow Jesse ller is a Serial entrepreneur a New York Times bestselling author part owner of the Atlanta Hawks and an ultramarathon Runner most notably Jesse sold his private jet company Marquee
