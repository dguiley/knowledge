keeping your body fat percentage somewhere be between 10 and 15% or something in my mind there's no reason to do trt um and a lot of kids because of social media they see the muscles they see the vasculature and they also if they try it they realize that it makes effort feel good and it does increase lito Vigor Etc but it will shut down your sperm production and it has effects on the [Music] brain Professor Hu where does this podcast find you I am currently in Los Angeles where are you I'm in London but I was I was telling the team here uh I was asked if there was anyone in the world I wanted to have on this podcast who would it be and of course I said Barack Obama but you were number two you literally we've been trying to figure this out for six months so we really are excited to have you here let's bust right into it we'd love it if you could start us off with two or three insights regarding um sort of slang conventional thinking about our physiological Health what are some things that we think we know that we don't about our health our nutrition exercise go wherever you want sure well the first one will be surprising only to some but I think uh nonetheless is really important to start off with which is that there is so much evidence both Real World um you know experience as well as now just fantastic science to support the fact that sleep is the foundation of our mental health and physical health and of course by extension performance in any Endeavor right academic cognitive musical mathematical Sports Etc why do I say this well let's just take the mental health piece there's a beautiful study published not long ago looking at over 880,000 subjects where they essentially looked at these people's relationship to light during the daytime exposure to sunlight exposure to artificial light as well as exposure to light at night something that we know disrupts things like melatonin production melatonin being important for making us sleepy and a bunch of other things too and and essentially what they found was that there are two separable components to light our sleep patterns and our mental health and the basic takeaway is the following people who strive to get ample amounts of light especially sunlight in their eyes early in the day as well as people who just have bright lights on and get outside for a walk every once in a while look outside a window step onto a balcony during the day have far superior mental health than people that don't in addition people that suffer from and they looked at a huge number of different mental health conditions depression anxiety PTSD manic bipolar disorder those people experience diminished symptoms of all those conditions okay so that itself is very important and it's also important to point out that screen light rarely is bright enough and indoor lights rarely are bright enough you have if you're lucky enough to work in an environment with a lot of big Windows Flor to ceiling Windows um and get a few walks during the day you're doing great um but most people are in relatively dark environments during the day as it relates to this mental health thing the second thing that's really important is that Darkness at night is a separable but also important component and I don't think this gets as much attention and it it really deserves attention for instance in this study they showed that people that get nighttime light exposure suffer far worse symptoms of all mental health conditions than people that don't and this is separate and different from daytime light exposure this is what's important to understand in addition people that really strive to darken their nighttime environment you know di the lights towards sleep keep the Sleep environment dark enjoy many many physical and mental health benefits in fact there was a study published in the perings of the National Academy of Sciences not long ago that showed that even a fairly low intensity light in the room as one sleeps with eyes closed presumably unless they have an eye mask on will disrupt morning glucose levels it's a dramatic effect and so what is this telling us does this mean we have to be in pitch black at night and we have to be in bright you know uh sunlight all day long no what this means is that we should all strive to get some sunlight in our eyes early in the day to brighten our work environment maybe include if you suffer from you know kind of lack of energy or diminished mood whatever time of year not just in Scandinavia and the in the depths of winter but you know maybe invest a small amount of money and by the way I don't have any relationship to these companies you know a small amount of money into a 10,000 Lux LED you know these run you know $100 or less you could even use a ring light that's designed for selfies you know you're getting more photons more light energy we know that this improves mental health and physical health focus and energy in dramatic ways some like being the best and if are concerned about excessive sunlight because of sunburn we can just quickly say that when the sun is low in the Sky low solar angle sunlight as it's called the UV index is very low so getting outside and getting some sunlight in your eyes early in the day is a absolutely important thing to do for our mental health and physical health and then at night making some attempt to dim the lights if you have to be on a screen dim the screen there are other things one could do but you know dimming the lights and try to make that sleep environment dark the most inexpensive way to do that is with a comfortable eye mask or something of that sort you know this seem like simple things but what we're really talking about here is is a primordial mechanism that is in all of us whereby photon's light energy arriving at the eye and then passing through the lens of the eye to the retina which is the essentially a piece of your brain believe it or not you have two pieces of brain lining the back of your eyes like pie crust activates a specialized set of neurons they're called intrinsically photosensitive melanops and gangling cells but the name doesn't matter and then they transmit an electrical signal to an area of your brain that sits right above the roof of your mouth called the supermatic nucleus that sets in motion an enormous number of things within your brain and body the release of certain hormones the release of certain neurotransmitters things like dopamine serotonin certain peptides that essentially if you do that in the early part of the day and a few times throughout the day that light exposure you're going to be more awake feel better you physically and mentally throughout the day and you will have an easier time falling asleep at night now the the tricky thing is is that light exposure in the evening and at night it doesn't take very much in order to disrupt for instance your melatonin activity there's a a wonderful laboratory at Harvard Medical School Charles iser's lab that has shown that even 12 seconds of very bright light in the middle of the night will quash your melatonin levels now that happens every once in a while no big deal but if you're somebody who is in a bright light environment at 10 p.m. and having trouble staying asleep you know you go to sleep at midnight 12:30 and then you or waking up at 3: in the morning chances are your evening and nighttime light exposure has something to do with that there could be other things too right too much caffeine late in the day Etc and this is a big part of what I believe is related to the you know the Mental Health crisis that we're seeing not just in young people but in adults as well where people waking up in the middle of night they're looking at their phone you know then in the morning they're not feeling rested then they're you know overindulging in caffeine and by the way I love caffeine I'm a you know heavy user of caffeine I'll admit that um overindulging in caffeine but they're staying Indo and putting on sunglasses driving to work they're an environment that's well lit enough for them to you know carry out their duties but they're never getting this strong circadian signal and we know that basically every mental health condition is made worse by this type of behavior and that every mental health condition that we're aware of is made better through these simple zeroc cost adjustments to our interactions with light so Andrew now do exercise and then I'm going to ask you to do the same thing for nutrition so with respect to exercise it's very clear moving our body okay exercise is essential for immediate and long-term health and I don't have to list off the reasons cardiovascular health which of course relates to brain health as a neuroscientist people ask me what's the best thing I can do for my brain keep my memory Etc as I age and be healthier mentally and it's simple get great sleep every night and then I explained one of the ways to do that um and if you don't get great sleep for a night have some things in place that we can talk about to adjust for that so sleep is the foundation of that but then it's it's exercise we need to move what what does the literature tell us the literature tells us that we should all walk a lot why well walking is if you're doing it briskly is that you know kind of zone two cardio that we hear a lot about these days that's great for everything from metabolic health so managing blood glucose insulin and mitochondrial Health etc etc but we can break things down into a simple formula that I've been fortunate enough to followed for the last 30 plus years got into this when I was about 16 48 now and it's the following if you do three sessions of cardiovascular exercise per week in any format I would say that you can do without injuring yourself so for me I like to run um but actually if I cycle I end up with some back stuff and so I I run I like to run or Swim uh it's a little hard to get access to a pool sometimes so I mainly run if you do three sessions per week one longer session you know say 45 to 60 minutes long slow distance kind of just you know um just barely able to have a conversation maybe a little bit faster one session that's a little bit quicker maybe 30 minutes where you're pushing a bit harder you know where it's hard to hold a conversation but you're not sprinting all out and then one session that's very brief maybe just 10 15 minutes where you know you do some sort of sprinting not all out but you know 10 15 maybe 20 seconds and rest 30 seconds to a minute and then repeat anywhere from 5 to eight times we know that if you do that you're hitting a number of important metrics for health first of all you're creating that kind of base of aerobic activity you know this is not going to prepare you to be a marathoner of course but you're getting that zone two two-ish cardio that's good for so many things the faster clip exercise um which is slightly aerobic it was slightly anerobic excuse me but still mostly aerobic where you get your heart rate up that's going to do a number of different things in terms of your conditioning and your ability to tolerate these you know kind of more stressful cardiovascular sessions not just in these sessions but in life and I'll talk about that and then the shorter um bout of exercise uh one day per week is essentially give you access to your V2 Max right it's improving your V2 Max which is your ability to bring more oxygen into your system overall for any number of reasons this is great okay let's just translate why all that is great well first of all life involves sometimes taking a long walk hopefully with loved ones or a hike or maybe carrying a kid or backpack or a picnic basket some distance um it sometimes involves sprinting for the for the flight that's going to take off it's sometimes involves doing some you know hard work in the yard or moving stuff or you know helping people with suitcases or helping a friend move these are like these transfer to real life conditions and I think the best exercise regimen has this translation into real world activities now it's also vital and we know this for men and for women that we do some sort of resistance training that resistance training can be done probably two or three days per week and can be very effective done as whole body workouts keeping up you know three sets for major muscle group you know three sets for quadriceps three sets for hamstrings three sets for biceps triceps back chest shoulders you know three times per week maybe two times per week if somebody doesn't have more time than that totaling a session of about an hour or you could split things up uh which is I've opted to do one day a week I you know train my legs because that's very important these are large muscle groups to keep strengthen the legs one day a week I train the Torso you know some pushing and some pulling you know some dips want to do push-ups this is also important that resistance training doesn't necessarily mean going to a gym you could have stuff at home or you could just use body weight can be very effective if you're doing it correctly and then one day a week you know you sort of biceps triceps calves maybe some um additional abdominal work some people like me are be fans of training the neck just for stability and postural purposes it's not about having a big neck in fact you know I I don't think I have a particularly big neck relative to my head size you know it's just it's about posture which is so important especially nowadays with all the texting three days per week takes about an hour per session of course there are and most people focus on the aesthetic uh consequences of this right because training with with resistance is is one of these rare instances in life where you actually get a window into what the results will look like people I should just say people who are concerned about getting too big keep this in mind you will never get any bigger than you appear at any moment in the gym from a work out so let but resistance training is peculiar in the sense that you know like if you do a set of curls the biceps get bigger but that's transient but you're getting a visual window and a and a you know a sensory window into what it's going to look and feel like should you give it proper rest and nutrition to recover that said I should caution I think that the male audience mainly oftentimes will get very excited about getting stronger and will throw their bodies out of proportion and and will also make themselves subject to injury this is the guy with the big upper body no legs or um who is always complaining because they they insist on squatting heavy every time or benching heavy or whatever so but the point here is that resistance training is not just about aesthetic changes it's about keeping your muscle healthy as an organ which is vital for longevity it's about the nerve to muscle communication remaining healthy which is vital to brain health in fact many of the tests for things like Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia involve looking for instance at changes in distal muscle size so you know atrophy of the calves people age is associated with age related cognitive decline now these things are correlative not causal but we know that people that resistance train in a way that includes the distal portions of the limbs so the the calves the legs Etc not just doing some you know pressing while seated you know kind of simple stuff but more elaborate compound exercises being able to jump down off a block even if it's a small block maintain cognitive function far you know further into life than people who don't and that has to do with the fact that you know nerve transmission from the what we call the upper motor neurons the neurons in the brain that control the lower motor neurons and the spinal cord that then control the muscles that whole pathway is vital for essentially you know brain to body communication and there's feedback in a way that you know it's not going to reverse Alzheimer's but it can certainly adjust the slope of age related cognitive decline which everyone experiences you know in the in the correct direction the direction you want so there's that reason the other reason is when you have muscle and you're exercising your muscles even if you don't have a lot of muscle you are improving your metabolic Health you can eat more comfortably and know that that especially protein foods are going to be metabolized and not converted into body fat stores you're staving off different kinds of insulin resistance so what we're basically talking about is three days a week of cardiovascular training it might sound like a lot but it's one one hour session a 30 minute session and a 15minute session and then we're talking about two or three hours per week of resistance training and that might sound like a lot but it goes by pretty quickly and um you know there are a lot of different routines for this out there you don't need to purchase one actually at our podcast website we put a foundational um fitness program that's zero cost to access you don't even need to sign up if you want to sign up for a newsletter you can but you just go to hubun lab.com go to newsletter um and just see the foundational Fitness protocol sets and wraps alternatives for different exercise Choice it is very important and this is among the more important points about exercise that I don't hear often enough one of the best ways to get and stay in excellent shape is to make sure that you do not get injured and this is super important means EAS in all of this slowly over the course of a month or two if you're not trained up pick exercises both for cardiovascular training and for physical training that you can do consistently without hurting yourself and I think people get a little too obsessed with exercise variety um do the same things and use Progressive overload or slow the Cadence or really focus more on the muscle contractions obviously trying keep boredom at Bay but one of the major ways that people get hurt and I hear this over and over again is a friend invites you to try a workout and even if you're not a competitive person someone say hey like let's go try this thing and you take a class taking a new class there's always this new class new workout or a friend inviting me to do something and then you hear about it my back thing is out or my shoulder you can really throw off your entire health program with a nagging injury so avoid those injuries as much as possible and this is true for the young folks and the older folks you you you really really want to guard your physical health unless you're a competitive athlete your goal is to train five to six times per week and get a full day of rest once per week your whole life I hate to say you can take a week off every once a while if you get usually for me that's if I get a you know cold or a flu or travel or something or you're not sleeping well because of Life stress but not getting hurt is so key so pick exercises that allow you to train hard enough and not get hurt and then the last point about this is I think about 85 to 90% of workouts should be at about 85 to 90% of what you could do um so for instance not every rep not every sets of failure um not every run needs to end with a Sprint you know if that Sprint is something in you and you want to do it don't go all out and then I would say the remaining workouts could be at slightly higher intensity but don't worry about you know keeping some gas in the tank also for people that aren't athletes keep in mind if you do a hard resistance training workout in the morning you'll have more energy but in the afternoon you'll tend to be tired and that has to do with oxygen uptake you kind divert it away from the brain so there's exercise I think in a nutshell H nutrition yeah so this is a fun one because never in any scientific or Health Community have I seen more fighting about anything it's almost amusing how how much fighting occurs around this and I think at the same time there's a key principle that emerges from all of it that everyone seems to agree on which is that it is going to be best to get the majority meaning 75 to 100 if you're really strict but 75% or more of your food intake from nonprocessed or minimally processed foods now is it the case that processed foods are terrible well they can be but the the reason getting majority of one's food intake from nonprocessed or minimally processed food so this would be if it's in your nutrition plan you know things like meat fish eggs chicken um fruits vegetables rice oatmeal pastas things like that is that it sets you up to eat foods that have macronutrients of course protein fat and carbohydrates but also micronutrients that you need and that generally tend to be pretty filling compared to more processed versions of those things packaged version now does that mean that rice is a because it comes in a package is a processed food well sort of that's I say minimally but when you produce a sort of single ingredient food and of course you can put other things in it right um butter olive oil nuts in low quantity seem to be healthy for us nuts and seeds in low quantity they're very calorie dense and then of course it's up to you or all of us to decide you want to be a vegan a vegetarian an omnivore which I happen to be or there are these carnivore folks so we you could be in any one of those categories and the first thing I said would still be true the other thing that we know is immensely important is to support the gut microbiome uh because it has Rel ship to brain health immune system Health cognitive function and of course we have microbiomes in our nose in our urethra our eyes you know but the gut microbiome is so vital and the best way to support the gut microbiome is to consume one to four servings of low sugar fermented food per day these exist in all cultures so things like kimchi sauerkraut kefir Greek yogurt again low sugar versions of these low sugar kombucha you know that it is not necessary to take pill form probiotics it's not if you're doing this it's also important to get enough Prebiotic and probiotic fiber which you'll get if you're consuming fruits and vegetables and we all know dark leafy vegetables fruit with colorations of berries although berries can be kind of expensive but um if you can afford them some berries you know oranges you know the kind of rainbow of fruits they those also include of course fiber and of course we know that excess sugar isn't good now people who really understand nutrition will say well it's calories in calories out it's it's the laws of Thermon Dynamics so yes you can lose weight on a you know on a hamburger and milkshake diet if it's you know less calories than you burn each day but you're going to lack micronutrients you're not going to get enough fiber your gut microbiome will suffer and so by eating mostly Whole Foods and minimally processed foods and thinking a bit about the gut microbiome with respect to fiber Prebiotic and probiotic fiber so fruits and vegetables as well as ingesting some low sugar fermented food each day you're going to feel significantly better your weight management if that's your thing is going to be far easier there's also something that is starting to emerge in the literature and Kevin Hall at NIH is doing work in this area but people in this General space are starting to talk about which is when you eat Foods close to their whole or minimally processed State the brain can make the correlation it's un it's a subconscious correlation between kind of food taste volume macro nutrient content so like if you eat for instance a steak or let's say an orange in either case you're tasting that they're also amino acids from the steak going into your gut your gut is actually signaling your brain unconsciously about how much more to eat and Signal satiety centers and there's this whole learning it's a it's a it's a system a neural system and a hormonal system that's very prone to learning so that you start to associate your appetite with how much you need to eat in order to get the proper amount of amino acids which is largely why we eat to talk about this the amino acid forging idea plus essential fatty acids and we tend to get better at not overeating for what we need right we tend to get enough of what we need but not eat too much now when you eat Foods in combination like a sandwich that's not a bad thing you I love a really good sandwich but it's harder to ascertain what what you're getting from each component and people often will ere eat Foods in combination you know so it doesn't mean you have to eat every ingredient separately but there's a lot of learning that takes place when one moves more towards Whole Foods or minimally processed foods and this is I believe this is just hypothesis this is one of the reasons why when people go on an Elimination Diet like they decide to just eat meat or become vegan and really focus on healthy fruits and vegetables that they feel so much better and often lose a lot of weight they must still be obeying the calories in calories out laws of thermodynamics in order to lose weight burning more than they consume that is but there's a learning there the level of the brain and the body of oh when I eat this it's very satisfying feels nutritious when when we're eating highly processed foods there's a tendency to bring and we know this by beautiful paper published a few years ago people tend to overc consume food they don't register their satiety as well so this would be like macaroni and cheese and and muffins and things like that things that could survive on the Shelf a very long time even in their final ready to eat form and when people eat those Foods I don't think it's just a disruption of sort of metabolic Health which we know occurs over time but also A disruption of the brain-to-body communication around what we need what's satisfying and what's enough so this business of how the brain and body learn to associate experience with nutrition with what's healthy for us and what's unhealthy for us it's both cognitive and conscious as well as unconscious and it relates to the fact that we are largely amino acid foraging and fatty acid foraging it is true there's no such thing as an essential carbohydrate but most people including myself enjoy carbohydrates and they do provide fuel for certain forms of exercise and in my experience I can think better when I have eaten some carbohydrates um at least in the previous few days we'll be right back so I'm trying I'm 59 I look at my health holistically good on sleep okay on nutrition what kills me is travel and alcohol and I want to break this down I'm trying to reduce I I just drink a [ __ ] ton of alcohol I believe what Winston Churchill said I've got more out of alcohol than it's gotten out of me I'm good at it not not an addictive personality i' really enjoy it but as I I get older I realize my 59-year-old liver just can't process things the way a 29-year-old liver can process so I'm purposely trying to wind it down uh at the same time just being very transparent I love to be high and I love the feeling of being under the influence of substances and so I which substances are your are your well I don't I don't really do a lot of stuff what I've done is I've tried to todle or dial back alcohol and I'm doing Edibles now and I do Edibles two three times a week to help me sleep I enjoy them I realize there's no free lunch here but if it's realistically if a lot of people you speak to who are like to think of themselves as high performing people but also enjoy the right term is I need a more optimistic term than getting [ __ ] up or parting or whatever and but recognize they need to reduce their alcohol intake one is there a type of alcohol that's less punishing and two if you are going to do THC or something else is there something that on a risk adjusted basis has the highest Roi in terms of feeling good to to minimum damage on your body let's assume I am never going to be Andrew huberman right I'm just not going to be fully optimized I want to I want to run at 80 to 90% uh but also quite frankly give a lot of the guilty pleasures around substances what is the what is the Old Navy of substance abuse where I get 80% of the high for 50% of the damage uh great questions and and I should say you know um optimization is a you know a something that we have to think about on a day-to-day basis so it is true I did rounds of sauna and cold this morning you know I I I did I did I got up really early a friend came over I haven't seen a while ago earlier than I would have liked and did sauna and cold um and I did train yesterday but there are days you know I miss days you know and it happens and you know life so I don't want to give the impression that you know my entire life is is geared around protocols to the point where I don't do other things I went out to dinner with friends last night you know I experienced stress in life we could talk about that uh like anyone else so I would say this um figure out the minimum amount of alcohol that you're happy to drink that that makes you feel you know like like you're living life so maybe that's a drink a night maybe that's to week maybe that's stacking a few more toward the weekend what whatever is going to work there and provided that your sleep is good meaning we know it's going to disrupt your sleep architecture somewhat but provided that you don't have excessive daytime sleepiness provided that you are not getting an increased frequency of colds and flu you're you're accomplishing your work I would say you're you're doing great especially since you know you're you're you know visibly fit um if you can do the three cardiovascular training sessions and the two or three distance training sessions that I just described without you know dissolving into a pile of cells on the on the floor afterwards you know even when you're doing an 80 95% of intensity or let's say 85% intensity of what you could do you're doing great you're doing great now with respect to alcohol you know it the stress lowering properties and the fact that is often associated with social events and the fact that this is related to stress somewhat but it also takes our mind off of things we probably don't want to think about you know it it marks a a transition point for a lot of people at the end of the day you know it's hard to dump thoughts you know so you like okay they have a drink and then they're like into the evening and then next morning they're up and at it again I that's that's perfectly healthy and understandable thing now with respect to cannabis so this is interesting I just did a 4-Hour um interview it hasn't been release yet with a researcher who works on cannabis I've done a solo episode about cannabis and and this um interview was actually sparked by a clip that we had put on Twitter on X and then he jumped at it you know he he insisted certain things in it we're wrong then he came in and we had a discussion and turns out we agree on far more things than we disagree about let's put it this way there is some evidence some that high potency meaning high THC cannabis use May exacerbate or be correlated with uh mental serious mental health issues psychosis in some people but obviously that's not happening for you here's what I learned from him which is very interesting we hear so much about how today's cannabis isn't yesterday's cannabis um you know that that you know weed in the 70s was so much milder than weed today and indeed that's true it's being engineered grown to have much higher concentrations of THC or varying levels of THC so one can select what they like in smoked form or Vaped form this is what I learned people are remarkably good at adjusting their let's just call it like the depth and number of toes um in order to achieve a a fairly consistent blood level of THC so if they happen to get higher concentration um cannabis and by the way I also learn and I'll just pass this along for folks because as I learn I like to pass things along it's there are reasons why it's you're not supposed to call it marijuana anymore there's a whole story there that's that's related to cultural issues and some issues potentially Rel to racism it's very it's so just um as they say uh look it up you know or look it any it right it's interesting so that's why I'm calling it cannabis okay um cannabis or weed so in smoked form people seem to be very good at at regulating their intake to achieve a kind of a a fairly consistent um level of THC in the blood from one intake session to the next Edibles however it's far more difficult to regulate the blood level because one can eat a whole cookie or eat an edible or eat half a cookie and so unless you're using the same Source this is where people sometimes find themselves in a very different mental state than they intended now is there tolerance is it addictive this these things are still heavily debated I would argue and this is not based on randomized control trial that that people who are like heavy cannabis users when they don't have their cannabis they get pretty cranky because a lot of people use it to manage anxiety and there's some interesting studies taking place about looking at genetic polym morphisms and tendency for anxiety people who really prefer cannabis to other drugs because it does seem to be for them a way to adjust their anxiety I will say that taking cannabis before sleep may help you fall asleep it is definitely Dr Matt Walker talks about this the world expert on sleep really it's dramatically reducing the amount of rapid eye movement sleep that you're getting so if you are in a stage you know or a phase of life where things are particularly stressful keep in mind that rapid ey movement sleep is when neuroplasticity and learning occur but so where we learn to uncouple the emotional load of daily experiences largely through the experience of vivid dreams and this is why when people come off of cannabis they oftentimes get very very intense dreams because there's a rem rebound so just keep that in mind but if you're life is in order and you're not experiencing excessive stress and like you you don't have an addictive personality and you like an inedible every now and again you know I'm I never tell you what to do as long as you know what you're doing um I don't think there's any evidence that it's bad for other aspects of health is it going to make you better remembering things probably not if you're high while you're trying to learn things and there's a whole literature there that people often misunderstand where they hear well if you're going to learn on under the influence of a given drug um that you should then get tested while under the influence of a given drug and that's not true it just turns out that people who use a a drug like alcohol or cannabis consistently while studying for their bar exam just get better at cognitive L performing while Under the Influence but that's not a reason to do more of it so I would say it sounds like you're in a really healthy range and like I said you're visibly fit your your life presumably is more or less how you want it and so edible couple days a week at the appropriate dose where you know you're not going to get past that threshold um so don't let someone give you an edible and say hey this is this is great and go you know cookie for cookie with what you normally take that's that's you know a cautionary know I went to this event called Summit and it's sort of the way I describe it is learning man it's a cross between Ted and burning man I actually can totally see you there uh speaking I'm sure they've asked you to speak there and I really enjoyed it it was on a cruise ship on this Virgin uh virgin Cruisers ship and I went up to grab a drink of the bar and he said oh my God someone ordering alcohol and I said what do you mean by that he said none of these kids you know they're all in their 30s High performing very successful people in the tech industry and within about 30 minutes someone came up to me and offered me mushroom chocolates and what I figured out is there's this movement among aspirational High achieving young people to substantially reduce their alcohol intake but they still want to be high and they're doing mushroom chocolates and a mix of all kinds of other [ __ ] that I couldn't even figure out or remember all the all the acronyms but they're basically have decided and I think in general wealthy people want to believe they always have a better mouse trap but they had decided I'm going to nurse one drink and then I'm going to do my mushroom chocolates or something else can you give me a sense for a that Trend and B what you think is there an upside to it or is this again wealthy people liking to think that they found something better I don't think it's just wealthy people I think we're seeing this trend away from alcohol although there's still a lot of this country in the rest of the world that consume alcohol in a regular basis and some and in some sense in a healthy way right like a um shot of liquor you know I mean I I love Russian Bas I go to because I love sauna and cold and so if you go to a proper Russian B there not just sauna and cold the Russians there are gonna have a you know are gonna have a couple shots of of alcohol also so they know they know how to do it for them so here's what I feel obligated to say first of all that the clinical trial data on psilocybin mushrooms for the treatment of major depression is very impressive but it's still illegal um and those are high dose sessions so those are people ingesting anywhere from Two and a Half to in some cases what's called a heroic dose you know five grams of psilocybin mushroom um you know five grams of psilocybin you're what a colleague of mine who works on this calls behind the circuit board you're not like doing I mean it's very it's an experience uh not necessarily one I recommend people can get very scared in there you know you have to work work with a clinician um still illegal but there are trials the studies of higher doses have shown some very interesting clinical efficacy but it has not yet passed into um P FDA approval likewise with MDMA ecstasy um treatment for PTSD right now that's a big issue because the FDA is soon going to decide but the early recommendation to them was to not approve we could talk all about that but Micro doing taking lower dosages of psilocybin mushroom which by the way um just activates a serotonin receptor that seems to lead to more communic let's broadly speaking more communication at sort of like resting network activity is broader brain areas that normally we talking to each other very little or talking to each other more in at the kind of in the default mode um that's what some of Robin card Harris's work at UCSF and others have shown and it very likely enhances the capacity for neural plasticity for rewiring of neurons now a lot of people confuse this and think oh well if they just take psilocybe and they'll quote unquote get plasticity but we have to remember that plasticity is a designed to be a directed process you touch a hot stove you get one Tri learning by way of neuroplasticity that hot stoves are bad to touch okay um that's directed plasticity it's adaptive when you learn a new language it's you sit there and you have to absorb the information make errors adjust for those errors and you get plasticity over time when you quote unquote just take a drive that opens up plasticity in air quotes that's necessar not necessarily a good thing because you're you're making the the brain vulnerable to rewiring in a very non-specific way so this is why traditional forms and these modern forms of clinical trials using psychedelics of any kind MDMA or which is more or less a psychedelic or considered one nowadays as well as psilocybin LSD Etc they're talking to the person they do rounds of therapy with that person off the drug before and after you know the person working through something or things so it's directed whereas when you just take something and go experience life it's non specific opportunity for non-specific uh rewiring now there is zero evidence to my knowledge there's zero evidence that micro doing can improve mental state as it relates to depression or mood but people report this quite a lot and that makes a little bit of sense because it augments serotonin Pathways in the brain through one receptor in particular but and if you think about the major treatments for depression and these are very controversial now but the SSRI selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors the net effect is to increase the amount of Serotonin at the synapse the availability of Serotonin and we know that other anti-depressants which rely more on dopamine or epinephrine Etc that relief from depression whether not it's through cognitive behavioral therapy alone or drug therapy or comination is a neuroplasticity phenomenon it's about reorienting the person's thinking about who they are are about what's possible in the world about what happened or what's likely to happen it's about creating more optimism so it's less about serotonin per say than the opportunity to rewire the brain and one's cognitive and emotional status so when these people are saying okay I'm going to not drink alcohol and instead I'm going to take some psilocybin they're boosting their serotonin a bit presumably they're also doing this because the day after drinking is always a bit of a withdrawal there's the anxiety people refer to there's the puffiness a lot of it um might be for aesthetic reasons you can't sleep very well often the sleep isn't of high quality let's also face it a lot of people make mistakes on alcohol and whether or not they make mistakes on pyb and I don't know I'm sure there's an opportunity for that right jumping off the ship would be a bad idea people have done stupid things on psychedelics but if you look at the lethal dose of something like psilocybin it's unbelievably High relative to like the lethal dose of alcohol if you look get deaths and and problems created by alcohol including bad decision-making yeah I mean these are astronomical rates of of bad errors at every level professional interpersonal life damaging life ending Etc so it kind of makes sense to me why people would be orienting towards things that have less of the danger and more still some but more of the kind of state shifting being able to relate to people differently in that elevated serotonin State they likely to at least think or experience a kind of more empathic engagement and we're seeing a lot of this you know the episode that we did of about the about alcohol in the hubman lab podcast you know humility aside that was the most listened to podcast episode for like two years running out of all podcasts like all podcasts and I was surprised because as somebody who doesn't really indulge in alcohol much I thought well we should probably just do an episode about alcohol enough people drink and let people know what they're doing but but I'm not anti-alcohol and I noticed it unveiled three things one the people who really love alcohol were pissed off that they had that knowledge they're like H now I know how bad it is for me I know I've tried to ignore it there's no ignoring the two of you you're the second is that people who didn't like drinking maybe if they had less alcohol dehydrogenates genetically maybe they just didn't like it they finally felt validated to say hey I don't want to drink it's terrible for me and then and that was a big category of people and then I think the Third category is the larger Group which is you know the people who like alcohol but they also want to take care of their health and they want to be able to live life including maybe have a drink for a very large number of years and they realize that you know throttling back a little bit and savoring it maybe this is Peter thing maybe focusing on a higher quality alcohol or you ask what alcohols are going to be best or Worse low sugar alcohols in general not because of the sugar per se but because of the hangover so like brandies and things like that cognacs are generally not as good for you in terms of The Hangover component as you know a clear vodka I if I drink I like a white tequila soda and lime that's that's like my thing you know especially with Mexican food on a hot day that's like nothing better stay with us what are your thoughts on testosterone replacement therapy yeah I have a lot of thoughts about this so I'm 48 years old I'm very open about this I always have been um I did not touch any any hormone augmentation of any kind but then at 45 I decide to run an experiment taking a very low dose of testosterone cypionate but also something called HCG human chonic gatot tropin which allows you to maintain sperm production because well I intend out children and I I don't want to kill my my sperm and basically when you take testosterone exogenously you shut down your sperm production maybe not entirely but it can be problematic so for so first things first and I'm assuming we're talking about men here because women are now doing testosterone replacement therapy low doses for libido and for Vigor and other things and women make testosterone too but as long as we're talking about men I can't emphasize this enough young guys meaning if you're younger I just don't see how unless somebody has a hypogonadal condition which you can be you know tested for why males younger than 35 and probably 40 if you're doing things to take care of yourself with sleep with exercise nutrition managing your stress keeping your body composition you don't have to be 5% body fat in fact that's probably bad for testosterone for most people unless you're naturally like that but keeping your body fat percentage somewhere be you know between 10 and 15% or something you know there's in my mind there's no reason to do trt um and a lot of kids because of social media they see the muscles they see the vasculature and they also if they try it they realize that it makes effort feel good and it does increase Lio Vigor Etc but it will shut down your sperm production and it has effects on the brain so here's my stance on this and I'll just again be very open about what I do I personally find that that the recommended dose for most people that's kind of just out the gate that these clinics do is they'll say 200 milligrams typically of testosterone cypionate per week so that's one cc one ml that for me would be like catastrophically too high I'm very sensitive to this so what I highly recommend is people go and get their testosterone checked and free testosterone so the range the reference range in the US is somewhere between 300 and 900 in other countries I think it goes up to 12200 but keep in mind there are some people who have testosterone levels of 500 or 350 even or 400 who feel great their libido is strong their recovery from exercise is strong they feel great there are a number of other hormones that impact this don't look strictly at number so if you're a young person and you're interested in or you're curious about testosterone therapy please go get your blood levels checked and it is true that unless you are below 300 nanogram per deciliter technically you don't need replacement now if you happen to be 500 and you feel like garbage please also get your free testosterone checked okay because if that's too low that means the testosterone you're making isn't available and if your estrogen is too high or too low this is important well then that could be an issue meaning this is a complex scenar iio but what's happening is people are just going and getting on trt and saying oh 900 is best now if someone does decide to explore testosterone replacement therapy there are a couple things to know first of all get your blood levels checked before during and should you decide to come off after very open about this I was sitting I was doing all the behaviors right as best I could also taking a few supplements that we know can slightly improve testosterone not not in a major way things like tongali f dojo for me increased my testosterone significantly I was sitting around 7:50 but I was feeling some afternoon fatigue that felt unusual for me and decided to run an experiment of taking um basically three 30 milligram dosages of injectable testosterone cypionate per week and I eventually Converge on something a little bit similar to that spacing it out a bit more but essentially 100 milligrams per week I feel fantastic it definitely makes effort feel great okay now the problem is that's a consequence of a bit more what we call sympathetic Drive which is has nothing to do with sympathy emotional sympathy it makes you kind of more forward Center of mass in general it's a higher level of stress you have to be careful you're still managing to get great sleep I also as I mentioned take HCG and if people are go want children at any point in the future and you're going to take testosterone at any exogenously at any level you have to offset that with HCG which is more or less like glutening hormone which stimulates the testes to continue making their own testosterone and therefore spare sperm production and um or you could go Bank sperm um although I would strongly recommend maintaining your sperm production and they're now at home kits that allow you to discern if you're still maintaining sperm production here here's how I feel about this get the behaviors right sleep exercise nutrition Stress Management explore healthy supplementation and I would say the things for supplementation that make sense for most people who can afford it are a quality fish oils so quality omega-3s get above a gram per day of the EPA form maybe two grams for a variety of reasons get some form of probiotic Prebiotic you could supplement this like you know people know and often associate with ag1 you could do it that way or you could eat more fruits and vegetables you know I mean there are a number of things in additional to to uh ag1 that is why I think it's good for me but again this is not a sales pitch for ag1 this is to say get make sure your foundational nutrition is going to take a multivitamin is basically what I'm saying for if you can't afford that or and then I do think that many people can get what they want without going on trt by making sure that you're training hard but not more than an hour per session um you know if you're going to do trt yes it's true you can probably get a bit less sleep and still recover because normally sleep deprivation over time would diminish your testosterone levels when you're taking it it's always tapped off but that's not good either because you're challenging the heart in ways that normally wouldn't be challenging so this could be a whole discussion but I really think that people need to pay attention to the fertility piece and then to really take the minimal effect if they decide that trt is right for them to take the minimal effective dose many people think testosterone good estrogen bad if you're male that is patently false if you crush your estrogen levels taking uh unless you need to reduce your estrogen levels you will have poor memory your cardiovascular health will suffer because you're gonna have less sort of pliability of the capillaries and vessels that innovate your brain and body and in addition to that estrogen is critical for libido and so a lot of people who take testosterone get high levels of testosterone then Crush their cortisol Andor estrogen levels using pharmacology high doses of an asrol they might be better off taking low doses of an asrol or which is a rotas inhibitor you know rasis convert testosterone to estrogen or not at all and letting their estrogen you know float up a it but be in the proper ratio with that now elevated testosterone and this is so critical you know I maybe it's because I'm male presumably I hear a lot from young guys are like hey should I get on trt I think that's a big no don't do it until you're doing everything else right and I'll also say I've gone off did an experiment when I went off it and continued to do things right and you do feel kind of achier after exercise and a little bit lousy but you can come off these things you need to continue to take HCG to make sure that you continue you to make your own testosterone you can reactivate things but I think it was the right decision for me at 45 all my other health metrics ldls and suffer in place and I will say this that it can provide the opportunity to do more work both cognitive and physical work and I'll also say that it did not create a big change in my body composition because I had always been eating well sleeping well to begin with and I didn't change the way that I trained that much and I've gone off and just kind of maintained and so I think I think it is definitely something people are paying more attention to and trying but they need to be extremely thoughtful what do you think of creatine creatine is great creatine has a ton of literature for creatine mostly for sake of cognitive um enhancement that the conditions of cognitive enhancement are sort of unique in those studies often like cognitive enhancement while at altitude or cognitive enhancement after sleep deprivation these kinds of things but 5 to 10 grams and I say that because people are different body size right so I'm 100 kilogram so I take 10 grams of creatine per day I've been doing that since I was 16 or 18 I'll take breaks every once in a while you'll gain 5 to 10 pounds of water weight within your muscles mostly within the muscles when you take creatine and then you'll urinate that out if you come off it I mentioned that because a lot of women don't want to take creatine because they don't want that extra weight but it's mostly muscle weight and a lot of women can really benefit from more muscle and strength for all the reasons we talked about before but there's excellent data for Creatine keep in mind on a blood test your blood creatin level will be increased if you're supplementing creatine so don't be alarmed but it's very hard to get that 5 to 10 grams per day from food sources because a big steak a big rib eye steak probably only has a couple grams or you know three grams of creatine how many of those are you really going to eat without causing other issues what are your thoughts on trt I started doing it two or three years ago I do 80 milliliters is it a week injection 8 80 wait just because people 80 milligrams I guess which is a very low yeah and the way I would describe it is uh start start doing it three or four years ago lost the strength in the gym lost the muscle mass not the same virility or whatever you want to call it um and I just thought and my trainer said uh you're fine you have what you should have at 56 but why wouldn't you take it back to 45 and I took it and the way I would describe it Andrew is I would say it kind of makes you three to five years younger I just weird things like I felt like my skin was a little bit different just a little stronger in the gym well I feel better at 48 than I did at 25 and I think that's because I take better care of myself with respect to sleep I used to work 100 hours a week I would literally my my my ex-girlfriend Keegan was still jokes about this from time to time like we went on so many vacations where I would like collapse into the laptop meant the end like I was working on grants or I was working as a junior Professor you know before I got 10 year I mean you're familiar with this I would literally work until I would collapse and that's not healthy and in my 30s too and I had a lot of vigor but I would say trt can definitely bring that forward I think based on conversations with my colleague Robert spolski it's clear that it makes you more like yourself so if you're a slightly obsessive person it's going to make you more obsessive if you're a a very competitive person it will make you more competitive if you're more if you're altruistic and empathically tuned it will likely exacerbate that it sort of I feel like it raises the tide kind of on everything it makes you what I call forward Center of mass so I figure on anything we can either be back on our heels flat footed or forward Center of mass and so if it's work you're forward Center of mass if it's kindness you're forward Center of mass you feel like you have more to give and that's that elevated sympathetic drive that we talked about earlier that's literally the best the best ad I've ever heard for testosterone so two quick questions you've been very generous with your time the first is around exercise the second one's a professional question my dad this is one of the nicer moments of my father my father was in the Royal Navy and he had this thing called The Royal Navy Fitness handbook and it was burpees Pull-Ups push-up sit-ups and we used to do that together from a very young age and it really stuck with me and I've been work like you I've been working out my whole life and I started doing it with my boys 13 and 16 I call my boy on FaceTime who's a boarding school and I put him through like a 8 to 12 minute kind of multi-dimensional you know push-ups some Arnold presses with a weight assisted pull-ups cash out with some burpees do you have any thoughts on or advice for dads who are trying to get their teenage boys into working out in terms of kind of the right way to work out your your teenage Sons yeah well um just to make sure I close the hatch on that trt conversation because you said a an advertisement for it there are some health risks of blood pressure blood profiles and people need to think about that and and work with a really qualified physician and but some cancers right like prostate cancer if youit it is there's the belief among urologists is that it does not cause prostate cancer if you have a pre-existing prostate cancer it might exacerbate it when people have prostate cancers they often put them on antiandrogens but but it's also heart and brain protective isn't it what I've read is that true so I think if you're doing trt properly proper dosages for you it's going to be highly individualized that you're you're taking care of the other hormones in those Pathways properly not quashing them nor letting them get out of hand they just you're taking the fertility thing into consideration I think that it can be very beneficial because it allows you to do the work you need to do cognitive work the cardiovascular work I mean if you're running more as a consequence of taking trt and also able to do all the other things in your life then your net better off right but people who take it and then get lazy about things your net worse off okay now in terms of exercise I mean I was fortunate that when I turned I was always very physical soccer skateboarding swimming Etc I was never particularly excellent at any of those Sports just good enough to kind of hang in there um you know I got a girlfriend when I was 16 she was a year older than I was and I heard their former boyfriend was like a football player or something and I was like the skinny skateboard kid so I started doing my push-ups and my pull-ups and I will say that so it was the you know first girlfriend effect um and I and then I found like whoa I really like exercise I feel like there's a kind of direct relationship between effort and outcome and I always ran also I loved and I still love running so I would say that for young people and encouraging young people to exercise find out what physical activities they really enjoy for me it was running and I do like I did like weightlifting so encourage them to play sports because of the social dynamics and to be physical with respect to you know just Fitness and thinking about Fitness I think what you described as excellent you know 10 to 15 minutes daily even because they're young right they can recover of body weight type stuff so dips pull-ups Etc one of the best pieces of advice I heard recently and mindset advice she comes from a a a physician by the name of Gabrielle lion l y n um who's a medical doctor and she knows a ton about nutrition and training for men and women and her husband happens to be in the SEAL Teams I have a number of friends in the community and she said you know goals aren't really the way to think about things standards are the way to think about things this is very much borrowed from the military Community to think as you mentioned Navy a few minutes ago when you have a standard for yourself that you should be able to do five sets of five Pull-Ups for instance um on your birthday every year no matter what or that you should be able to do three sets of 25 full push-ups I remember the Presidential Fitness Awards it was like I used to train one year I had a grow spurt I couldn't do the seven pull-ups I didn't get the number four and I like I spent the whole year trying to figure out how to get back to seven pull-ups right and and and so when you have goals it's very easy to reach a goal and then lapse you know but when you have a standard you're always staying above that line and you have the opportunity to exceed that standard by a lot but you never let yourself drop below that standard it sets kind of an alarm on the low end that's also very high and I love this concept because it's like you have a standard for yourself you have a standard of behavior you have a standard of Fitness that translates to certain activities so that you never are unable to meet that standard and if your standard and this is a very jocka willink is but if your standard is you're going to train every morning at 4:30 no matter what except those rare occasions where travel or something inhibits it well then you're doing it no matter what whereas if your goal is to get up at 4:30 and train it only sets this High bar I'm sure there's a a natural psychology to this right um you know that that there that you need to you need to achieve that thing and then you check that box whereas the standard sets a standard means a a low-end critical threshold that you stay above but there's really no upper end either and I think the best situation is well kind of like the one that sounds like happened for you and certainly happened for me where I discovered I love to run I mean the only thing I'm upset about about training my legs yesterday is that I generally take a day off after training legs to recover and I want to train again today and that just feels great right so I would suggest that they do mainly body weight resistance training I know that there's a shift now toward allowing kids to do resistance training but here's my feeling about being a young person which I was once which is that the more variety of movement and sports that you do the better better off you are in life and fitness all the people I know who are hypers specialized in some sport don't seem to stay with that sport a long time they get injured they're not fit I mean the gymnasts are the exception because they seem to do all the different Dynamic movements they're strong they have speed they have agility but I think it's it's great fun to try a bunch of different sports and then if you're an athlete sure focus on one but with respect to Fitness I'm not a huge fan of of really young people you know lifting heavy weights and champ and I I'm going to get a lot of flak for this because Olympic lifting is a sport in its own right but I didn't really start lifting heavy until I was in my 20s and that for me was like I've never gone below three repetitions of anything so I've never done a single rep max of anything and people always go there's no way that's true it's absolutely true I'm interested in using it as a tool to accomplish something strength and in some cases hypertrophy and staying healthy is my main focus now and I will say this I got laughed at teased in college because I'd be out for a run on mornings where everyone else was doing their kind of Sunday Funday drinking I got teased for studying when other people were kicking back when I was a professor and I would go to meetings I would sneak off to the gym at lunch hour because I couldn't sit all day without losing my mind and one day I was in the gym at Colt Spring Harbor Laboratories in New York this is where people go for meetings and it's kind of science summer camp and one of the the most successful biologists in the the world still came into the gym and I was like oh and I was sort of embarrassed like I'd been caught doing something and I said wait a second this is your meeting and he said and he said yeah you know I can't be in these meetings all day it drives me crazy and I looked at him I'm like okay this guy has great posture he's fit he was in his mid-60s then he's still that way now I thought to myself okay here I've been like guilly running off to exercise to take care of myself the culture has changed a little bit now but if you're in a whatever dominant culture is around you beware that's why I always say even if you're hanging out with Rebels beware right you know you it's good sometimes to rebel against the rebels right um just keep it's not just about independence of thought it's that develop habits that you know are good for you and when the dominant culture is you know dude why are you working out or why are you studying like trust me and you can tell your son this I know you know this for yourself in 5 10 years people are going to be coming to you for advice because they're the ones carrying 40 pounds of extra weight or 20 pounds of extra weight or their libido is shot or they're wondering why they hate their job or their relationship and I'm not saying that I had all the answers but I've noticed that the people who are willing to take really good care of themselves and not in a vain way this isn't about vanity it's taking care of yourself so that you can do more in the world for other people especially but also for yourself like be the strong one who can help other people and once you your sons I think realize that they're going to be the best version of themselves for themselves but also they're going to be the go-to person that can help everybody whatever domain they happen to be in I think that feedback loop is so powerful because you feel like wow I I understand what self-care is I can refill the gas tank just through these behaviors last question at the end in the 40s after World War II physicists became celebrities Einstein teller Oppenheimer I feel like we're having a little bit of that moment where neuroscientists I think of you and Sam Harris are becoming famous and Sam more on the philosophical side you more on the optimis of of almost like how to live a better life through Fitness or or just optimizing and being thoughtful about your your nutrition your sleep your Fitness I get I don't know if you get these calls I get these calls from other faculty other university and they in as polite a way possible try to say to me my research and domain expertise has so much more heft in depth than yours yet you're so much more successful than me can you advise me on what I need to do you've got to be one of the most famous and successful neuros influential you know creating great Economic Security for you and your family can you give any advice around what were some if there are any hacks or best practices we've talked a lot about optimizing for Fitness talk about now optimizing for someone who is credentialed who has expertise but wants to be Andrew huberman what were the what are the two or three hacks platforms best practices that took you from a neuroscientist to someone who's have had has really remarkable influence thanks for the question so you my dad's a physicist and so I grew up hearing about the Golden Age of physics and and you know findan and like Gilman and all that and I think the interest in physics is you know physics is everywhere right and so it's Universal and um explained correctly is really um enchanting the brain and Neuroscience is everything right it's sadness it's grief it's happiness it's depression it's uh addiction it's Fitness it's it's all of that and so it's Universal and I would say that we're now also entering the Agee of where math and AI are um are going to become really important for public discourse so um so I would say the following and and and as a fellow academic you know that you know when one sticks their neck out there publicly like I understand there are going to be people in the academic Community who are happy about that and Stanford's been immensely supportive immensely supportive and I'm very grateful for that there will be people who are critical around specific points or the general idea of somebody doing what I do or what you do there will be people who uh feel that way because of jealousy there will be people who feel that way because they genuinely feel like it's not being packaged or delivered in the way that they would prefer and that's all fine and good I would say Point number one is if you're going to be public facing as you know you're not going to satisfy all those people you're just not at the same time I think people can feel in tension you know I think people um sometimes Focus there's kind of a gravitational pull around like cold plunges and supplements and we weightlifting that I think sometimes interesting topics that I really enjoy I think each one has an interesting uh science and then discussion around it which I thoroughly enjoy but I think sometimes they Overlook the fact that like 90% of what I talked about on the podcast is about neural mechanisms endocrine mechanisms I've worked on cold physiology and and to try and teach biology and it package in in sort of protocols for health and then teach protocols for health in a way to people who are interested in that and also you know get them a bit Enchanted hopefully about biology the the the number one takeaway for people that want to be do some public facing work or to um allow people to appreciate what they do is they I can't emphasize this enough if I could like put this on a billboard in Time Square I would except no one looks at Billboards anymore you have to be the pure version of yourself and this is why not everyone does this so I have I'm going to sound like a name dropper but I'm very fortunate to be close friend very close friends we communicate daily with Rick Rubin like the Rick Rubin and from NYU right I started record label it worked out well I didn't want you and Rick understands this that there's a certain energy that people have when they're really engaging in things in the in its pure form they're not thinking are people going to like this song is it going to you know be top chart song like the last one are people going to like this podcast it's just like I'm a very curious person and I've lived a life of adventure one of my My Heroes I have several Joe strumer being one of them um and the great Oliver Sachs being another right a neurologist public facing author who was also ridiculed by the way for doing what he did until he became famous enough that then he got appointments at multiple universities that kind of came back for it very interesting story and Oliver was a very curious person they once said uh it's in his book it says you know Oliver will go far provided he doesn't go too far he was a methamphetamine addict he was interested in bodybuilding he was also a closet homosexual that came out at the end when he you know and he had a bunch of things about his personal life that explained sort of um you know not just that but explained who he was in a big way but up until then he was just Oliver being Oliver he loved sea creatures he was always talking about the things he loves I I'm a very curious person and I love adventure and I grew up basically because of my family structure changing in a big pack of guys some female friends as well that's kind of driven my life i' and I've interacted with people at the kind of extremes of Adventure and extremes of career in fitness and health and science and so what I bring forward is my it's in feels innate desire to learn organize and disperse information that I find very useful for mental health physical health and performance along those Adventures that are just simply my life so I'm just being Andrew huberman and I'll I'll come right out and say you know people say all sorts of things they've said all sorts of things about me good and bad and everything in between but what I just said it like really describes who I am at my Essence and if somebody is a like an entomologist or you know in one or works on um I don't know like lipid signaling in the gut or whatever people study if they can tap into like the essence of why they do that and then teach it from that pure place they will be at potentially the biggest podcast in the world the best selling book in the world so it's not much the subject matter is the energy that one brings to it but that energy as Rick has pointed out over and over again and this is why he's so successful cannot be manufactured whatever it is that makes you you your relationship with your father your interest in Fitness your your appreciation for what young people are now going through and the challenges they face the desire to like you're just being Scott in the world and that's why people Orient toward you and so these colleagues that are like wait why is it that
