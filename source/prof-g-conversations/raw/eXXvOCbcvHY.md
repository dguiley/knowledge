one of the unfortunate consequences of meta's name change was the strong association with these Technologies and their concepts with virtual reality or social work rooms that we would use to engage in lie of a zoom call or physical meeting most of the Pioneers in the category strongly separate the two some don't even believe that virtual reality has much of a future Neil Stevenson who coined the term talks about it being Central to his idea of the future in the 80s but he has essentially disavowed the requirements to Virtual Reality or augmented reality from the metaverse and when you go to some of the larger businesses in the category whether that's of epic games or Nvidia they have no requirement nor expectation of a near-term solution for this [Music] Hardware Matthew where does this podcast find you in Midtown Manhattan so let's bust right into it you're one of the go-to experts on the metaverse a topic to be blunt we just haven't paid much attention to since some of the hype can you give us a state of play where does a metaverse and spatial Computing stand today in 2024 so overall those in the industry talk about these three different Peaks for the theme the first happened in the late 80s the early 90s that's where you had really all of the terms that we talk about today spatial Computing came onto the scene roughly 9192 the metaverse in '92 you had the Advent of virtual reality artificial reality certainly cyberspace The Matrix they all came out of that early period and that was sparked by the emergence of graphical user interfaces of the internet at large of 3D Computing simulation and video games and they all attempted to capture these terms what the future might look like and we very quickly realized that those Technologies were premature 15 years later we had this second burst of activity second life ends up on the cover of Time Magazine and there's a belief that we're going to see the metaverse finally come to fruition and in the following 2 to 3 years after that Peak for second life you have the starting of nearly all of the modern efforts to build wearable glasses and goggles magic leap you have the Snapchat acquisition of virgins Labs you have hollow lens you have Oculus VR and then we kind of encountered this 10 to 15E stagnation in the hardware side and then in 21 and 22 we had this other burst where there was General consensus that finally the Technologies had matured the internet infrastructure Computing Technologies even some of the wearables that we imagined we might one day wear that they had all matured to the point in which finally this 30-year-old term roughly 70y old conquest and 100 year old idea was ready for prime time and then it got poed onto the front page of the news by Mark Zuckerberg so he had this long progress of technology in progress suddenly lead us to this belief that it was imminently here if not changing the world already and so where are we in 2024 I think the focus on that hype the name and the relative unsuccess or general lack of success of Meda Suite of metaverse products has led to a belief that the idea has come and gone been duy rejected by consumers but actually the progress of all of the constituent parts has continued not just with more child and Leisure oriented activities Roblox and fortnite but indeed head mounted displays at large general computing simulation and the creation of virtual worlds using artificial intelligence but now that scrutiny has shifted elsewhere so give us the taxic definition of the metaverse what is the metaverse the best and easiest way to understand it is a 3D shared and live version of the internet the internet as we have it today is best understood as a dozen or two common protocols in a suite of standards that enable the consistent comprehensive and coherent exchange of data across 110,000 autonomous and independent networks hundreds of millions of different servers billions of different devices supporting about 5 million applications billions of websites all exchanging information and yet what that internet lacks is really three fundamental elements first is the ability to transmit again coherently comprehensively and consistently 3D information for it to be shared what you and I are doing right now live Zoom is essentially one of the few things we ever do on the internet that's truly shared and essentially everything that we do on the internet is not actually live when you and I go to the New York times.com not only are we disconnected from The New York Times server but even when the New York Times updates we're still looking at the old version of it and so the metaverse is best understood as a shared live in 3D augmentation to the existing internet as we experience it today so Technologies generally speaking you know everyone was happy to kind of pronounce crypto Dead about a year ago and it's come roaring back uh voice was super hyped it's it's come down a bit it might come back this does feel as if it's been I wouldn't say forgotten but it feels like there probably is still some opportunity there where do you see the greatest opportunity what industries do you think will register the greatest leverage of success around uh metaverse applications well I think to start one of the unfortunate consequences of meta's name change was the strong association with these Technologies and their concepts with virtual reality or social work rooms that we would use to engage in lie of a zoom call or physical meeting most of the Pioneers in the category strongly separate the two some don't even believe that virtual reality has much of a future Neil Stevenson who coined the term talks about it being Central to his idea of the future in the 80s but he has essentially disavowed the acquirement of virtual reality or augmented reality from the metaverse and when you go to some of the larger businesses in the category whether that's of epic games or Nvidia they have no requirement nor expectation of a near-term solution for this Hardware but if you're going to talk about where we're seeing these imminent opportunities that are perhaps not covered extensively I think there's two great examples the first is in the use of actually these headsets in more industrial use cas four years ago the United States performed its first ever live patient surgery using a mixed reality headset the first was spinal fusion the second Was the removal of a cancerous tumor on a spinal column the United States is now performing between 4 to 600 surgeries a year using these devices and the results though preliminary right we haven't seen a decade of patient outcomes do show that the surgeries are typically performed faster they're more accurate they are in some instances much cheaper and most of the surgeons that perform this talk about it in the same way that they did GPS in the early 90s are revolution in how they perform a relatively complex and yet routine process and yet one in which we're still not able to do nearly what we can with the technology today that we you know imagined a few decades ago it does feel like healthcare is an obvious example and so talk to me a little bit about gaming I'm an investor I made one of my largest Investments about three years ago an epic G games you so much of this is around syntax or nomenclature because I think of I think of fortnite as the metaverse to a certain extent I don't I I'm trying to figure out where where gaming and ends and the metaverse begins and give me a sense for now speaking as a advise me as a shareholder of Epic how the metaverse will impact gaming and who you see as sort of the winners in that space so you're right that a lot of this is a debate over terminology in fact even space which Apple has embraced has its Origins as I mentioned in the early 90s but it was never contemplated to actually connect to the physical world it was just a description of a 3D space in a computer and so all of these terms the metaverse included have kind of been perverted reapplied in scenarios it was originally not intended for and become a part of corporate propaganda right we're spatial not metaverse we're metaverse not spatial I interviewed Tim Sweeney the founder and CEO of Epic recently and he likened the metaverse to a stock price he said when something cool comes out it goes up when something lame comes out it goes down and more often than not over the last 3 years lame things have come out and certainly when you take a look at those leading use cases fortnite is one such example they at least don't capture the pop culture imagination the way that it did three to four years ago but it's a good way of understanding the proliferation of these Technologies and Trends Roblox as an example it has an advantage over epic as you know as being on mobile has about 375 million monthly active users that's more than the entire active user base of the switch platform the Xbox platform and the PlayStation platform nearly all of its users are under 18 and so you're seeing something that despite being concentrated at a younger demo is nevertheless larger than another category that spans all age demographics the other interesting thing about that category is of course those younger users have no interest in the capital mm word its Trends its significance it's just a form of habit and how they socialize but when you talk about the companies such as epic when people talk about the internet the internet is in some regard not unlike you know the constitution in the states in the sense that it was never meant to say static and yet it hasn't really been updated for several decades the consensus is that the standards which would support a shared live 3D internet have to come from private business and therefore you need other private businesses to willingly adopt standards and Technologies another entity owns and operates and therefore you need to trust epic looks like through its strength of existing platform its economic engine and then its stewardship by a more philosophical controlling shareholder looks like one of the most likely entities to Pioneer those changes there's a chapter I I guess it's an updated chapter in your book that explores the century-long history of AI and AI philosophy and also the six ways this technology controls the metaverse walk us through those so I think when you take a look at many of the technological impediments to building what many have imagined whether that's a headset or just a digital twin a persistent simulation of San Francisco as Tesla is now seeking to build a lot of the time we are facing literal laws of physics constraints that's actually why the Vision Pro is so expensive and yet so unrewarding for many users and so we're now starting to see these different ways in which our dreams are being made real through AI number one is that when you take a look at an hmd head mounted display like The Vision Pro the best way to talk about what you can't do is to compare it to the device many of us have a Xbox series X a PlayStation 5 those are 10B devices they're the size of two or three different shoe boxes that's despite the fact they don't need a battery that's despite the fact they don't need a screen and yet they don't need a mobile connection we don't worry about the heat that they generate too much because they're feet and feet away from you they don't need cameras to understand the world around you and they don't need to take safety precautions right to understand that there's Tax Returns on the table or that you're about to stumble over an object shrinking a 10 pound relatively underpowered device that doesn't need two of the heaviest things it can have a screen and a battery into something portable and wearable we haven't found the science that would allow us to overcome those challenges and yet through artificial intelligence we are actually starting to kind of co-opt that system right we're starting to come up with smarter ways to have the system predict what you're going to do so that it doesn't have to process it that processing requires battery for example it requires tax on a limited GPU in fact when you're wearing a headset one of the biggest challenges of just power reservation or preservation is when you see the Vision Pro you're actually looking at a reproduction of the world around you from three to four different external cameras that have to be stitched together but those cameras are actually captured about an inch and a half in front of your eyes and on an obtuse angle it's artificial intelligence that is bringing all of those images together shifting it back onto your eyes and then making it seem like it's coming from your eyes so that's just one such example of literally if we want to have like weight portable devices that are comfortable powerful able to do what we want it's actually not a question of lithium ion advances not entirely it's not about how many nanometers we have for how many different transistors a lot of the time it's how much smarter our systems can be with scarce information the two bigger elements are just about actually producing the world there was a lot of scrutiny and I know you've covered this around Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland and as expensive as that was it's shocking to most people to realize that the cost of making a virtual Galaxy's Edge is actually not necessarily less than it was to produce a physical theme part and if you actually want to staff that with individuals who can bring to life nabo or Navaro or the planet of ha it becomes more expensive still and so with artificial intelligence we're starting to see this reality that if you wanted to produce the Disneyland of your dreams have it populated as you might imagine and allow you to do essentially everything that you would want to do and by extension can't do in a theme park we're talking about billions of dollars in annual investment that is starting to shrink down into the hundreds of millions and where the cost curve might bring it even lower still something that I don't think gets enough attention is the application or applications of the metaverse and AI in terms of simulation or its use on the battlefield and you have you have a chapter on this give a sense for where you think this intersects with uh military strategy so the best way to do this is to talk about one of those terms that has kind of been forgotten and even Microsoft moved away from which is digital twins digital twins a few years ago became so common because every company that felt obliged to have a quote unquote metaverse strategy just said let's make a digital twit and they very quickly realized that sure it had some signaling value they got their employees to feel good about it they tested some new technology but they realized they didn't really know what they were going to do with it and one of the problems and this comes back to AI is there are really five different levels of digital twins that we talk about in the industry and the advanced ones require artificial intelligence and most of them were level one level one is a digital twin it's like a physical miniature it's a Model A diarama teams feel good about them Executives like having a diarama of their corporate campus but it reflects a statement it's a point in time and it doesn't have much applied value level two digital twins take that original digital twin and they make them real time using iot and other simulated systems you're now having a live reproduction of that environment level three are predictive digital twins they can tell you what's likely to happen level four are prescriptive they provide actual recommendations to the individuals and then level five we talk about autonomous digital twins those that can produce prescriptions and predictions at such a high velocity that a human agent can't actually effectuate those changes effectively so that's level 1 to 5 and by 345 we start to get actual utility but we require high levels of accuracy sophistication and velocity from AI systems we have two other axes one is the volume of data obviously you can have a digital twin that captures individual vehicles or fleets and that's a very big distinction and then we have the amount of other network digital twins you have are we talking about a factory plant or a McDonald's in Manhattan or are we talking about one plugging into the entire Corpus of a simulated environment of a Manhattan so once we understand this scope you start to talk about how these Technologies are being used today in particular in Battlefield testing where you're saying we have all of these systems that can today do a decent job of predicting and prescribing activities for a relatively stable system with relatively low cost of failure and by that I mean a production facility pretty stable in what it's going to do and the consequence of a line pause is real for General Motors or Tesla but it's not life-threatening there's still a belief that we don't have the level of prediction or prescription let alone autonomy to bring that into an active Battlefield and what we are however seeing in the UK is a Pioneer here is the use of this in active training in better simulation of what may or may not go right or wrong and in general this connects to your earlier point which is the technologies that are almost always used to actually test this especially with human agents is the Unreal Engine out of Epic you uh also had an addition of the book where you're talking about big Tech's fight over undersea cable infrastructure and starlink versus Amazon's project Kyper I I'd love just you have such a big brain around I don't even think of he's the metaverse guy I think of he's more like kind of like The Cutting Edge Tech guy I look at starlink and I see something that has the Moes the width of the Amazon and that this thing could be potentially one of the most valuable companies in the world and some of this is just I've had such an incredible experience with a product uh when it's offered on planes talk to me about starlink um if if you agree that it's got that sort of potential and and product excellence and Moes and who are the competitors and where are they relative to starlink so I love this question and it actually gets to the earlier Point around upd or supplementing the Internet Protocol Suite as we know it there was a largely undercovered fight going on between the big giants to actually own the submarine cable infrastructure of the internet meta as you called out in 2018 they owned 0% of what we call the internet backbone or the oceanic backbone by the end of this year the free internet Foundation estimates that meow will own 12 to 13% or own co-own or be the capacity owner right essentially a leas hold like a wireless tower of all submarine cable infrastructure about 170,000 kilometers of cable they will own the cables that connect 47 to 55 different African Continental countries and it's believed that out of the 12 to 133% they own worldwide 40 to 50% of all of the African Continental intern infrastructure that has led to additional escalation from Google and Amazon companies that were much farther ahead in purchasing and owning these fiber optic connections when you talk about starlink you're again talking about another system that we don't have a traditional competition or comparison for but is now roughly 70% of all low Earth satellites that we have globally including all of those of China and NASA where they're expected to put up another 12,000 in the next 12 months up to 30 to 40,000 more and the cost and velocity advantages they have over any other competitor is astonishing and so I'll bring that back which is you say okay so what's the challenge with updating the Internet Protocol Suite the challenge with the Internet Protocol Suite is it's decentralized no one mandates a protocol's adoption we've proposed many and so one classic example is the Internet Protocol Suite does not differentiate between any packet of data it doesn't know what's real time you and I talking and it doesn't know what's an email or Netflix stream and so you and I may have our call dumped because there's congestion in the network and a network hop just says well we've got to pick between these two so let's dump Scott and Matt to let the email through severing the connection not just delaying hours to get everyone to agree you need 110,000 networks Millions and millions of different routers to all say let's accept it and there's no simple let's classify this versus that because all data has different demand needs and so when you start to talk about the scope of meta's ownership of cable infrastructure or starlink you start to have a private party that can forcibly or effectively produce new protocols that reshape how the internet manages and discriminates traffic I'm not talking about net neutrality I just mean like the fundamental understanding of data and routing to start to change the way the most profound technology of the last 50 years operates in a way that at least in some regions of the world and potentially globally through starlink nothing else can even propose an alternative and that's where you get into something truly remarkable and that's a moat that would perhaps take 50 years to even try to chip away at so you're bullish on starlink I think it's remarkably hard not to be yeah that's my sense too what other okay so starlink what other companies when you look at how all the moons are converging or not converging here what what other companies are you especially optimistic about so before I shift it over to interactivity and gaming at large I was primarily focused on Hollywood and media I was the head of strategy for Amazon Studios which ran at the time essentially what users think of to be his Prime video and I'm very familiar with your perspective on generative AI look I think that technology is remarkable and I think you can kind of tell the general fears around that technology by how the criticisms have changed a year and a half ago it was the number of digits that were on a finger right now most of the criticisms that I see are that it looks great yes but it doesn't have the Nuance of a human expression of a human performance they say it's clui right the lighting is bad it's not dramatic and just the fact that we have gone from visual deformities to a normative sense of like taste is extraordinary and of course the funny thing about that is to even believe that the visual presentation or the performance is flawed is to assume that there's a uniform human response to those things when we know that there isn't which is to say an expert may say that doesn't land the way that Cinema or Scorsese would but that assumes that every viewer would the pace in which that technology is improving is remarkable I think the ethics of how a lot of the training data has been used are often reprehensible or at worse willfully ignorant of the ramifications but having gone through this firewave of virtual production and real-time production which we realized was probably 10 to 15 years ahead of schedule I think that we are very quick quickly coming to that fundamental change point for how generative AI is used in workflows for video game for music or cinema at large and I use Cinema deliberately as opposed to just movies or content so it's had a strategy for Amazon Studios how do you think AI if you will is going to sort of crawl up the stack of Hollywood is is it the existential threat that the wga claimed it was and yet got no protections from it as far as I can tell or do you think it's it's actual or is it a productivity tool that potentially lowers costs and some some media companies adapt others don't but on the whole the medial ecosystem stays robust and some there are winners and losers or is it really going to start is it going to disrupt Hollywood is Hollywood the next Detroit at sort of the feet of AI what what are your thoughts here and if you were still advising Amazon or traditional Studio where do you think how do they best defend or or go on offense here in leverage AI well we have to keep in mind that one of the reasons I think that Hollywood has been more skeptical around generative AI is the lessons of the last few supposed waves when you take a look at Netflix Netflix in many ways or streaming video democratized video distribution and it changed the monetization but it did nothing to alter the cost tructure of production it's one of the reasons why fans decry the fact that streaming has replicated the Cable Bundle but it's more expensive well of course we haven't come up with any real Innovations to the production cost we produce more expensively than ever before in part due to the competitive intensity brought about by the democratization of distribution you go back 15 years earlier you get to VHS a new channel a new monetization scheme but it didn't again change how we produced digital film in the Advent of computer generated imagery in the early 990s in many ways was expected to change production and democratize it by eliminating sound stages but the cost of digital cameras at the time the cost of CGI actually elevated budgets to the point in which anyone who wants to have an epic or a spectacle the films that do best in movie theaters requires often not exclusively but often hundreds of millions if not more Hollywood is therefore kind of a tune to this idea of the new disruptive technology doesn't change production therefore maintains the merits of project financing of distribution slates to diversify risk of sound stages and in many ways the actual cost of running generative AI systems right now plus the importance of distribution that they've spent 15 years trying to build up through streaming has led many to believe that yes it's a disruptive force it is more likely than not going to affect below the-line workers and supporting systems but many believe that especially with the law on on their side that it's still going to shake out mostly for them I'm skeptical because I think that we have never before seen an actual massive disruptive force on the production side and one that in classic disruption Theory suggests that many of their existing resources become at best distractions and at worst cumbersome cost hurdles for them and so this is to say it's it's a little bit difficult to predict the outcomes but I do think that everything that we expected from YouTube that we didn't get which is to say a massive volume of independent creatives that have never touched nor gone through a traditional Pipeline and yet are producing content that doesn't look like a $300 million Marvel film but looks like a 40 or $50 million Marvel film only it is more easily updated and edited changed customized frankly transplanted reimported into an immersive environment into a storybook form that's going to be really hard to to slow and crucially because Hollywood will no longer own the distribution lever can't sty hyp the only place I would take exception is that I do think on the production side there has been a globalization right they've brought down some production of the ri's gone up by producing stuff in South Korea and Spain I think Netflix has done a pretty good job with that would you agree with that depends on how you want to Define that do I think that Netflix has done an outstanding job in Spain in South Korea in Australia absolutely I think investors often overlooked Netflix's advantages because they compared it to HBO domestically a business that had 50 years of investment competing against one that had a few years of investment without appreciating that in many foreign territories Netflix is HBO not just to the consumers but to talent to production expertise they own sound stages they pre-booked sound stages that they finance the construction of for years at the same point there isn't much evidence of the routine repeatability let alone efficient production investment of those foreign Internationals hitting over here we have squid game but squid game was now you know three plus years ago we had money Heist before that a title that they didn't actually produce but purchased the license to I think that is to say Scott I think that by American Standards where we're used to5 to5 million per power Netflix has excelled in diversifying their International production to the $2 to5 million budget level when servicing those Regional customers but I haven't yet seen so much evidence that they've been able to substitute the American diet for high cost scripted shows which much lower more efficient International scripted shows on balance we'll be right back if feels is we've written about this that the kind of the streaming Wars if you will are just this great case study in economics overinvestment because the markets are willing to replace or say we we want growth over profit so there's a massive overinvestment and now we're going through a ShakeOut cost cutting consolidation as you look at the landscape here of all the different streamers who do you think the winners and losers are who is who are the consolidate ores and the consolidate e and any kind of off-market predictions about what might play out in the next 24 months well I think we have to start from the fact that even as recently as 2020 it's remarkable how profitable that category was people talk about payv but I think it's generally underappreciated that if you can believe it payv or network television distribution was a top desile eitaa business in the United States the median industry has a roughly 13 14 15% EB D margin Network distribution was around 37 to 40% in 2020 that compared with Renewables nicotine and oil and gas why because the amortization that you netted against your operating income was enormous because you had to build pipelines any system that said just shifting from a top desile to a top quartile category meant that you were going to lose roughly oneir of your profit margins that you probably had two times the cost structure that you needed and that's before accounting for the fact that your two biggest competitors non-traditionally are Amazon and apple which need not a dollar of direct margin and you're competing against a business Netflix that said we don't care for 20 years there is no way there has never been a way to run away from that system and so all of the outcomes that I think have long been predicted seem as inevitable now there's too many players the cost structures remain too high and that's before you even take into account the aforementioned generative AI displacement there's nothing the average American still in 2024 does with their free time more than watch TV and I don't think that that share of time is even going to last as a result of video gaming social media and other practices that we see from the younger generation and so we're going to see more companies go belly up we're going to see more companies merge and like Paramount and Viacom find out that despite their doubled size they're going to end up half the size they were so take it a step further I'll put this out there um Time Warner survives Disney survives Netflix survives other than that I feel like all bets are off what are your thoughts how do you mean survive like as going concerns or direct to Consumer business my sense is they're all recognizing even the Deep Pockets of Amazon and apple realize they don't have the appetite to make the Investments to be kind of Standalone big competitors here and they're everyone's looking for a dance partner or to get acquired it just feels like the whole there just isn't enough room for all of these players and what I'm what I'm putting to you is who do you think get acquired sooner rather than later might we see one of them actually get unplugged well look I think it remains very hard to imagine what the independent future of a Lionsgate or Stars will be especially as a separated entity they kind of have all of the drawbacks they had as a combined entity plus none of the narrative and none of the ability to at least tap into two segments of the value chain AMC has been looking for a dance partner for 15 years clearly overestimated its value over and over to the point in which there's no dance partner to find for them but the more important aspect is look if you take a look at wbd these days it's circling less than $7 per share it's a collection of assets that seem increasingly out of wack you have the Turner Sports regime that's apparently about to lose its NBA assets you have CNN you have HBO which as of now is decoupling further still from the rest of Max I think it's important to recognize that under current leadership wbd has actually sold off most of their plausible growth story they've renewed a deep into 2030s distribution agreement with Bell Canada they're apparently renewing their Sky distribution deal in Germany in Italy in France they've renewed a South Korean distribution agreement an Australian distribution agreement with Stan at the point in which you're saying we're going to downsize our domestic business in HBO we're going to start licensing all of our content to Netflix and anyone else who will buy it in all of the international territories that have the highest streaming penetration we're going to retreat and license for the next decade to come and then you're giving up your most valuable rights on the Turner side CNN has no strategic adjacency and the stock price has lost 75% since it debuted only two and a half years ago it's very hard to imagine that that current structure can endure and that's not even talking about the video game side of the business and Matthew before we go here we have a lot of young people who listen to the Pod and are working hard trying to establish currency in a professional Marketplace and I think anybody that looks at your back ground and what you've achieved and the seat you've sort of created for yourself and I think that is a really cool profession can you give us a little bit of the backstory about how you got to where you are now and any advice you might have for young men and women who are looking to you know establish what is uh what feels smells and looks like a really cool well-compensated career so I'd say two things growing up in the early 90s I was a Relentless user of these really hard to use systems I was a big pirate in the 90s I was on IRC chats I was using MS DOS the use of those products often provided I think a intuitive understanding of what was around the corner why because often the systems that especially Hollywood starts to bring feel regressive at the time right I'll give you an example like TV everywhere is one of the biggest disasters that Hollywood has ever invested do you remember ultraviolet Scott yeah and it was one of those things where if you had been a pirate and I don't endorse piracy I'm talking about the products of using these experimental Technologies you all of a sudden realized that what you were being asked to use was a woefully inadequate version of the already clui systems that you were doing 10 15 years ago and then when that's put in parallel with a product like Netflix that yes came from an independent company that didn't own its destiny that was licensing content that had all of its plaws that didn't have live sports in live news it provided me with a much clearer understanding of this is at minimum a better model and at maximum a better model that is competing with companies that don't even know what a good model looks like and are to some extent ignorant of what consumers are already doing and so I do think that using those Technologies constantly which in the case of crypto means going through truly terrible systems and often losing your money as a result of it not saying that you should speculatively invest there's no substitute for that you can't cannot learn it by reading blog posts and going on Twitter the second thing is I would say I've done a good job in my career of constantly switching out of a category where I believe the big strategic problems have solved and then focusing on the categories where you only have hard and sometimes intractable questions in the case of the metaverse or VR that means going after a field that you're going to get wrong a lot of the time it's part of the reason why I've updated this book it's a 70% REM make from only 2 and a half years ago you can't think of the metaverse the same way in 2024 after the Vision Pro after the crypto crash and Resurgence and after the Advent of AI but if you can be relatively unsentimental about going for in my case streaming video was really hard in 2013 you didn't know who to hire you didn't know the business model it was darn hard to get an app on a Samsung TV any television but by 2017 2018 we essentially figured it out which is why 2019 we saw every single service on Earth come to Market I pivoted out to an uncertain category and when you have the opportunity to learn go to Labs talk to entrepreneurs on slack day in and day out about something no one has figured out yet but most people think is about to become significant you end up with a multi-year advantage that you can continue to compound for Matthew ball is a CEO of aelon a diversified holding company that makes angel Investments provides advisory services and
