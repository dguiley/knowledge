# Building advanced AI agents is easier than you think

Published: 2025-11-26

Everyone's out here building billion agent army videos on YouTube, but if you've ever tried one of them, you know that it's kind of useless in real life. Hello, Telegram. Yes. Could you please ask Nadn to make me a billiondoll business and then reply back to me when Jeff Bezos is knocking on the door? Thank you. I love you, N. But they never call the right tools. They're not easily customized. They don't build good enough plans. all the stuff that you know kind of important. That's why I built a four rung ladder framework to take you from beginner to actually being able to deploy an agent that does real stuff. So in this video I want to show you that framework using a tool that's easier than NAND and more customizable than OpenAI's agent kit. And that's why over 60% of Fortune 500 companies ship actual production agents with this tool. It's called Crew AI, but specifically I want to look at the Crew Studio. We're going to dive in how easy it is to get started and how you can build on it progressively in order to build something that you're actually happy with. So, that being said, let's get into it. So, all agents really are when you boil them down are language models with different forms of memory that can call tools to get stuff done and that are put in some sort of control loop. And so if you're looking for a tool that is an approachable way to build agents, you want something that has those four different pieces built into how it operates. So given that, I like to think of approaching agent building kind of like a ladder. You need those earlier rungs on the ladder to use as a stepping stone where you can get a sense of how do these things kind of work in a real life environment. But before you know it, you're standing on the very top rung of that ladder while your parents yell at you shouting, "Get down, Sean. You're going to break your arm." And so, the fastest way through this all as a beginner is to start in the first rung and then start adding layers of complexity as you get comfortable with it. Because that type of process builds your knowledge and the context that you get from experiencing something. So, rung number one is learning without technical overhead. So, the thing that I love about Crew Aai's studio is how accessible they've made agent building for people without significant experience in AI engineering. So, we can eliminate the analysis paralysis that typically comes trying to build something like this from scratch. And the way we do that is through natural language and drag and drop tools. So, we could come through here just like we would in a tool like Lovable and just explain in natural language what it is we want to build. So, in this case, build me an agent that takes a user's primary goal and builds them a 12week training and nutrition program. And so, what this thing is going to go do is it's going to move through and actually build us a very basic version of an agent that can do this thing. And so on this level, similar to what we would have inside of N8N, it's very drag and drop. So we can come through here, we can customize the tasks that the agents are working with, the type of output that they're going to be giving us, the specific models that get used, we can give it new tools. A lot of cool stuff that we can do again in a very easy drag and drop kind of way. And so here's an example of a 12week program that this thing literally just built me in about 30 to 40 seconds that has an actual search step integrated into it using cited research papers in order to actually come through and build out this training program for me. So it goes through each phase from the foundations to the hypertrophy phase to the strength phase giving me specific days and what to do on each of those days with an accompanying nutrition plan. So again, prompting this thing took literally 30 seconds and out the other side within just a few minutes, we have a first pass of this thing. And again, really simple, really approachable. And at the end of the day, it is some version of an agent. Now, when you look at these execution logs, one thing you will notice is that it's flexibility and the amount of quality that you actually get out of each stage. again compared with a tool like N8N's agent is significantly better which results in a more complete and sensible output. Now let's say we wanted to take this up to the next level and go to rung two which is understanding the patterns under the hood that actually power these types of agents. So inside of Crewai's interface we can go over to the agent repository and we can actually build standalone agents. So, the thing that I really like about Crew AI is that they've already made a lot of these architectural decisions. So, you won't get lost too much in the weeds about what to do. And so, the way that crew works is we give a role, a goal, and a backstory for every agent so that it knows what it's intended to do and how it's meant to go about doing that. So, if we were to go back to this idea of a like personal training agent, in that first workflow we ran, everything was taking place with just one agent. It was like the master personal trainer that built the workout plan and did all the nutrition research. But down the line, we would want to actually create different agents that work together that have specific specialties and specific tools that they can use. So once we've defined its purpose, such as a head nutritionist that goes out and actually builds the nutrition plan based on what needs to take place for this person based on their goals, we can come through and we can start assigning tools that this agent will be able to utilize. So let's say for example that you log most of your meals inside of Google Sheets. You could come through and actually configure Google Sheets as an option. But let's say we want to just give this thing the capacity for actually researching something, searching something online. We could come through and we could select something basic like the Brave search tool. Now, once we've created this agent, we can access this agent in any of those automations that we built out earlier. So, Crewai has tons of builtin tools that you can use like exarch. They have tools for rag lookups. So maybe you have certain exercises or nutrition paradigms that you follow and you want to give it access to that stuff to be able to build your plans out. We could even use something like a calendar lookup tool to make sure that whatever plan we're building for this person actually fits with their schedule. So we have our agent and then we can really easily just give it access to tons of different tools that it can use when it's moving through and doing what we ask it to do. Now, like you'll see in rung three, it's actually pretty easy for us to build out our own tools using something like cursor or cloud code and then give our agent access to it in the crew studio. But once we've built out this head nutritionist and gave it all of the tools we wanted to have access to, we can head back to our studio and connect it in to our lead personal trainer agent that we already have. So, now that we're back over in the studio, we can actually use that custom agent that we just built. And we can pair it with that lead personal trainer to make the two actually communicate with one another. And so, all we've done is drag our existing agent on. And then we gave it a few new tools just to show off what it can actually do. And now if we were to go into the actual flow of execution here, we can see that we had our main program designer who went through used the different tools and gave back a highlevel week-by-eek fitness plan. But it then delegated some of that work over to the head nutritionist to actually look at what we are intending to achieve. looking up scholarly articles, taking the actual fitness plan that we had, and then making sure that the output we get out the other side is actually researchbased given what the user's goal really is. And so, we're getting now like full micronutrient breakdowns. It's using different advanced BMR calculation formulas. So, it's doing a lot of really awesome stuff. So, we have this full plan, but what if we wanted to get very specific now? So, what if we didn't want to just have it use a web search, for example, but what if we wanted it to actually go out and use a real nutrition database to build real meal plans for this person instead of just sample meals? Well, rung three is how we can take what we have now and expand or extend the capabilities by building custom tools and giving these agents access to them. Now, one of the things about Crewai that's pretty cool is we can come through and say something like Crew Aai tool create and then give the tool a name. So, in this case, let's say we wanted to be able to look up real time nutrition data. We can come through and create that via the command line. So, what this is going to do is it's going to go out and it is going to create us a basic skeleton of this tool that we can then just go in and modify and push back to Crew AI. And so this is where Crew AI really is awesome because we can easily extend our app infrastructure with new tools in a really approachable way which is great for beginners. So let's imagine we wanted to have this custom tool that goes out. It can read or query the USDA food data database and then return back to the agent or to the language model real time macronutrient info for the meal plan that it's trying to build. So, in that other example, it went out and just kind of tried to build a meal plan based on things that it had read, but this is going to let us get very specific for that person so that it's dialed in to exactly what they need. And this wasn't something that was built inside of Crew AI, right? So, we are extending it with our own tool. We can give API keys. We can pretty much interact with anything under the sun. So without this system, I'd be trying to manage all these imports manually, trying to coordinate it all together with other agents and a chat interface on the front end and all of those other things, which again is technical overhead that stops you from the learning process. So instead, I can just publish this and then it is available across all of my agents. And all we need to do to do that once this thing is built is type in crewai tool publish. And that is immediately going to send it up into our actual crew studio. And so if we were to go in here and now look at this function that we had made, it's called the nutrition database food lookup. It looks up nutritional data from the database. I can pass in what the actual API key is that it's going to need to use. And so now if we were to go back into our studio and we went back to this head nutritionist, I could come in here. I can go down to custom tools. I can now just drag in that tool that we just made. We can see that we have the nutrition database food lookup. And now I could go run this automation again. And now we can see as this thing starts running that it's starting to actually use this tool we gave it to look up foods in its intended meal plan and get back all of the different macros. How much fat is in it? how many how much carbs, how much protein, it's getting all of this returned from that API. So, rung number four, how do we actually get access to this thing and really start using it in the wild? Now, there's actually a bunch of different ways for you to access what you've built. We can access the tools individually. We could access the agents, but in this case, I want to show you two concrete use cases. So you can actually come up and just download this project to your computer and you will get a complete system that helps you actually run this crew yourself locally. So you can go in and look at the actual crew, how it's been configured, the tools it has access to, all of that stuff now that if we were trying to deal with all of this locally would have been a huge pain in the ass. It's now been abstracted and done inside of that crew browser. But if we want to get to the point of really dialing this thing in, we can now just download it, come in here, and start iterating our next level of understanding of how these things actually work. We can connect them in different ways. We can allow them to do more advanced stuff, but the first piece is getting access to it on our computer, which again you can do with a simple download. And so what this means is that your agent becomes programmable infrastructure. Like you can embed these things now into existing projects. You can chain them together into pipelines or you can orchestrate them together at scale. Maybe you want to combine these in different ways, add in more specialized agents, add in tons more tools and then deploy it somewhere. Well, now we have the code and we can actually do that. Now the second option is we can actually access this via an MCP server. So if we were to go and publish this thing live. So once that crew is published live, we can go to the automation. We can go into it. We can go down to actions and then export this as an MCP server, which means the agent you just built becomes a tool that can be used in other systems. So for example, you could expose this service via your MCP server and actually connect it to other fitness apps. And so you've just built like a distributable AI infrastructure. or if you just want it for yourself, you could connect it to clawed desktop and use it for your own personal use cases. Now, all of this is really just still scratching the surface because crewai can be extended to do a lot of really, really awesome stuff. And so, their documentation is filled with different patterns that you can learn about and use to expand what your crew or your agent is actually capable of. everything from agents, how it handles tasks, orchestrating crews, creating those flows or those control loops of how things work, giving your agents knowledge, training them, giving them reasoning capabilities. There is a lot of stuff that you can do, but the first step of course is understanding that first rung of the ladder and then moving through to the more advanced pieces. So, that's it, guys. A simpleish surefire way to get started building agents, which again, I think are going to be the future. If you want to see more content like this, make sure to subscribe.
