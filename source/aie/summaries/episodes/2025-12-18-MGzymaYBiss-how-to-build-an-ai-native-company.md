# How to Build an AI Native Company

In this episode, the speaker delves into the new frontiers of establishing AI-native companies, providing insights from their experience at Every.

## Core Thesis
The development of AI-native companies currently lacks an established playbook, requiring organizations to innovate and share experiences collectively. By achieving a full AI integration across operations, companies can significantly enhance productivity and develop sophisticated software products even with small teams.

## Key Insights
- Achieving 100% AI adoption in engineering teams can lead to a tenfold increase in productivity compared to having just 90% of the team using AI.
- AI tools enable developers to work concurrently on multiple tasks, promoting a culture of rapid prototyping and experimentation.
- Enhanced collaboration through AI allows for smooth knowledge transfer and integration of freelancers.
- The concept of "compounding engineering" suggests each software feature should simplify the development of subsequent ones.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Foster an all-in approach by aiming for comprehensive AI adoption across teams to maximize organizational productivity.
2. Encourage rapid prototyping to lower the energy required to start new initiatives, thus fostering creativity and innovation.
3. Invest in AI-powered tools to streamline onboarding processes and facilitate efficient collaboration across varied technology stacks.

## Notable Quotes
> "I think the playbook is actually being invented right now."

> "In traditional engineering, each feature makes the next feature harder to build. In compounding engineering, your goal is to make sure that each feature makes the next feature easier to build."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
By embedding AI deeply within their workflow, Wilde Agency can enhance their engineering efficiency, accelerate product development cycles, and cultivate a more dynamic and adaptive organizational culture.
