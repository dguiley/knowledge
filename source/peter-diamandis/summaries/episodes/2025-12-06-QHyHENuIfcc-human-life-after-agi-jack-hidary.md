# Human Life After AGI: Featuring Jack Hidary

Jack Hidary explores the transformative potential of advanced artificial intelligence and quantum technologies, emphasizing their implications for energy, robotics, and global socio-economic structures as we approach 2030.

## Core Thesis
The integration of AI and quantum computing presents new capabilities that will fundamentally enhance human capacity across various domains, rather than replace it. This synergy, coupled with breakthroughs in energy technologies, will drive society from scarcity to abundance, transforming economies and global power dynamics.

## Key Insights
- The fusion of AI and quantum computing offers unprecedented potential, with applications in material science and medicine.
- Transitioning to energy abundance will affect socio-economic landscapes and reduce the geopolitical focus on oil.
- Quantum computing promises revolutionary improvements in computing power, necessitating a shift to quantum-safe technologies in cybersecurity.
- Robotics will see vast adoption, driven by declining costs and advancements in embodied intelligence, affecting diverse sectors from logistics to elder care.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Invest in quantum and AI technologies to harness their revolutionary potential.
2. Prepare for changes in energy sectors as SMRs and nuclear advancements pave the path from scarcity to abundance.
3. Anticipate and adapt to the socio-economic shifts due to energy abundance and technological advancements, particularly in healthcare and geopolitics.
4. Transition to quantum-safe encryption methods to guard against emerging cybersecurity threats.

## Notable Quotes
> "The AI and quantum coming together gives us a new superpower and it's upon us."

> "Once you have abundant energy, the whole economy becomes meaningless."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
