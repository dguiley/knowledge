# Cold email work like THIS

Published: 2025-05-07

Yes, but there's one tweak to make it work better. So that would say like that's like okay and it will probably perform okay. Um one level better is you get them to uh contribute to the report. So if you make the report broader, you can ask them for their insight. It's the same thing. You're appealing to their ego a little bit. You know, like we're making this big report. Um we only are talked to the top brands. We've already talked to your competitors, by the way, and we'd love to get your insights and I'd love to tell you like what everyone's saying off the record, right? If you do that, um, you will and and you really do that. That's the thing. You can't just fake it. You have to actually do it. So, if you do that, now you have a you have all of their brands associated with your report. Now, run an ad to that report. You know what I mean? That's it's the same thing just like the pocket. It's the same thing. You're it's way more valuable because it isn't this thing you made. Recently, I decided to learn more about cold email. So, I picked the most knowledgeable person I know, which is my friend Jean Michichel Mo. He already came on the podcast on the channel to teach us the reverse organic advertising method, which was already awesome, one of the most valuable video on the channel. And he's back to teach us about cold emails. and he's really qualified for that because he literally has sold millions in high ticket offers via cold emails. And I'm not a beginner. So don't expect me to ask like the very basic questions. We we are both marketers and I really want to understand like the the approach how to frame uh a cold image strategy and it completely flipped my way of seeing cold emails. By the end of the conversation, I had a completely different view of it. And I'm just going to tease it very quickly. But he explained to me how we can use how we can tap on people's ego to generate conversations that will lead to high ticket sales and how we can use podcasts for that. Yes, podcast and cold emails. And how we can use industry reports for example. So that only is worth listening to the conversation or at least it was worth for me to have it. But on top of that, it also changed my way of seeing how we can position an offer for cold emails or rather should we use cold email for a certain offer. Because as an advertiser, I always want to really narrow down the problem of my customer and be really sharp in my copy so I can run good ads. And I thought that called email was the same. Turns out it's not at all the same or at least for high ticket sales. I don't tell you more. Uh you can listen to the conversation. And by the way, it wasn't supposed to be a podcast recording. I literally generally asked him, "Okay, Jean Michelle, can you teach me about cold emails? I want to get the skills right. I know I can use it. So please, can you get on a call and teach me?" And just before the call, we said, "Okay, let's record it. If it good, if it is good, we can publish it. Turns out it was. So, I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. And let's dive in. And yeah, I'm really happy that you you you're willing to to teach me your secrets. Absolutely. Of course, there's three secrets. Just kidding. Um, cold email is really straightforward. And the the the I think this is the big secret to marketing is there's no there's no trick. So, as long as you're emailing people and offering something they already wanted to do, they will reply to you because people do read emails. Um, I think there's like this misconception that like people don't read cold email. People don't read garbage spam emails because they get auto spammed or they just like, you know, click on. It's the same thing as people don't respond to complete garbage ads. That doesn't work either. You know what I mean? So, um, yeah, I think with cold email, you don't know if they want something. So it's really in your best interest to offer the broadest most wonderful thing you can. It makes me think of actually like um corporate events. So people I mean companies pay to send their people to like you know events and the whole thing is like you're building your network you know that's why they that's why a company will like expense a hotel the tickets the flight uh you know showing up and still every event has free alcohol. Why? because they they have to get the sales guys to actually show up and like do their thing. Otherwise, it's even less valuable. So, you really like um free beer is a great one, but you know, you you have to offer something that people want. That's the trick. Yeah, it makes sense. I mean, I I received tons of cold email and you know, when my my YouTube channel took off, um you know, it was kind of fun at the beginning to receive some. Someone was like, "Oh, people are reaching out like let's read them." And then it's like three, four, five, 10 per day. Sometimes it's just it's terrible. It's like the competition is fierce. Yes. And at some point, I wouldn't say I'm not reading them, but I'm I'm getting good at spotting them. Yes. And for for some I I see right away it doesn't make any sense. Like literally the person has make made no effort. But I I I I realized recently that I also I mean maybe because I'm way probably more aware of what we can do with AI than the the average person. Yeah. But but I also spot the the really well done uh AI research. So yes, you know some someone will mention someone something about my one of my video. I'm like, you you wouldn't have mentioned that even if it would be a normal email. You don't have to. Yeah. Yeah. I really like how at minute 413 you mentioned uh you know, Peter like what? Yeah. Sure. Sure. Of course. It's very hard. So, so circling back to what you just said, um you just need to offer what people want. It makes sense because I I don't think the trick now is to pretend that you have actually spent an hour uh searching the person. Um yeah, I even think like admitting that it's ju just being to me I I know that the ones I I enjoy reading are the one that are fun, you know, funny funny to read like you make it fun. That definitely you make it fun. So sometimes I'm I'm just answering I'm like okay I don't want your offer but great email good good job you know. Yeah. So even even if I know it was automated not made for me did the guy didn't d my content I don't care that the guy spend an hour on my content but at least either it's to me either it's fun or yes sometimes for example I remember like some you thumbnail thumbnail stuff like you you get a lot with the YouTube channel. Yes. But some some would would give a thumbnail which it's intriguing. Yeah. And they can obviously they're automating that too. But it's pretty cool. It's like we just made you these great thumbnails. That's way more interesting than hi. Can I make your thumbnails? I get those too since I manage like 10 YouTube channels for other companies. I get like so many. That should be terrible. 10 with one. It's already Yeah, it's fun. So So how do we make it amazing? How do you make it amazing? Well, first of all, let's talk about you. Um, why why do you want I mean, you know how to do so much in marketing, right? You you you've uh you have a great YouTube channel, not easy to do. Um, I know you've run ads successfully. Um, you've launched brands. Like, why do you want to who do you want to get a hold of via email? Um, why why bother? I would say you you you introduced me as the curious marketer. So there is a lot about that. I I know you know my brain works in a way that I you know a lot of people would be like okay I need to do that let's try to do it. Oh I I I can't solve this problem so I need to learn this technique. Mhm. The way I as a consultant because that's my main uh job. I I figure that I I love to learn stuff. Um I know already about code limit. I mean, I've done it already, but I know that I'm not I do not know enough to be good at it, like really good. And I know that we only work with the tool that we know. Yeah. Which means, you know, when you try to solve a problem, you will circling circle within your mind with the stuff that you know, and it's very hard to to use the stuff that you don't know. And I find myself circling a lot about uh ads because that's my thing, not content guy. You know how to do ads? Yes. Yeah. I know how to do ads. So it's always like Yeah. Oh yeah, we can make ads for that. But cold email is strong. Mhm. And and I I I just wanted to to learn about it. Maybe it will serve me for my consulting. Maybe it will serve my my clients. So yeah, it's it's a more general learning project for me. Okay. Yeah. And then let's let's make it concrete. So who who would you like to get a hold of? Well, let let's take the example um I had in mind, but it's probably not I don't know if it if I will do it. Um I was thinking uh to reach out to Shopify brands that are making certain amounts of revenue especially um that are spending a certain amount each month. Yes. Okay, that's a great example. Let's just take e-commerce broadly. Um, and I can show you some some methods. And you mentioned like, yeah, we're always going around the tools that we have. But this is why I like to go into more things related to principles or because then it doesn't matter which tool. There's so many, for example, we're talking about the offer, right? That that will affect your ads, that will affect your cold email, and it doesn't matter like how you're getting it done. um is really spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about like what do these people really want um and how can I give it to them. That is the that's the biggest return. I know a lot of people uh come to me and say, "Oh, you know, we had different agencies. Our ads don't work." And it's possible that, you know, everybody flubbed their ads. But I mean, a lot of times it's not an ads problem. It's a business model problem. Like, how do we make the people buy a second time? Suddenly your ads work great. You just doubled, you know, suddenly you doubled your revenue. Um or how do you make it easier to buy? Like, you know, I I work with people and um a lot of people maybe they have like a $150,000 offer. It's like, well, let's make something bite-sized first, and then the second, you know, once you've developed a relationship, it's a lot easier. Um, so these are these are great principles, but let's talk about like how do you get in front of ecom people? Well, wait, just just be before if you don't mind because I before I I lose it. Yeah, there are two things here and what you say that are hard especially probably with col it's hard also with with ads but uh first of all what people actually need most of the time they don't know it this is so true yeah something else so that's one thing and since they don't really know it um it's very hard to know what people wants or what people need before you have talked to them. So that's the the principle of cold email. Therefore, how to how to be precise enough, you know, I know that I can we can cover that when I get the generic offer and like I I received three of them today. yu literally why you and but a very two specific offer might be like I don't need that right now so so so those are like two different yeah this reminds me I was talking to somebody just the other day and you know it's a great company they've been around for like 30 years and uh and they're like hey we spun off a very specific element of our product and we want to make it like a you know uh what we call like a land and expand offer. We just want to sell this little cheap lower cost uh solution point solution and then that's going to let us get into in in into companies. And they said that you know so we had this we have our solution we took a little piece we're selling it there's a problem with our marketing because it's costing us a lot of money to get people to uh install this thing and and I'm like how many how many users have you talked to? like only the ones that we only only the people who have, you know, we've gone through the paid ads. There must be something wrong with our paid ads. And and I'm thinking, what do your people want to buy? That's the question. Not like how do I take a how do they sell my how do I sell more widgets is the complete wrong just to to to like go off of what you just said. Like how do I sell more of my stuff is the wrong question. It's a very expensive approach. Way easier. It's just like what do they want to buy? Especially right now in like 2025. There's a lot of like global economy uncertainty. Companies are spending less. It's way easier to figure out like what is their number one initiative this year. I'm going to solve that. I'm going to repackage my product to be related to that. Way easier. And having uh having this cold email generate conversations before you're pushing a solution. So like in so you know we've got direct marketing like do you want to buy this? Do you want this offer versus indirect? Would you like this free resource? Do you want to talk to me about XYZ? Indirect is so much better for cold because you're not selling anything and it can generate those conversations to to figure it out. Got it. Okay. So, how do we get a hold of ecom people? Let's do it. Let's do it. It's it's uh easy peasy. So, here we go. Do you see my enormous screen? Yeah, I see. Okay. Um, so there's not that many um Oops. I don't want to go into that. There's not that many steps. Uh the first one is we have to define uh the ICP like who who is your ideal client profile or customer avatar. ICA ideal customer avatar. There we go. So this is who. Um that's really the first one. Uh and then after we define it, we have to um pull a leads list. So we have to go find leads. So these are all different problems and you know there's all kinds of different technical solutions that we can talk about. Um and for example I know for ecom we can use some like Apollo will work but uh there's also specific ecom lists and list brokers uh that will give you um those lists. Um then number three is you have all the tech of you know setting up the tech of setting up your emails. So your cold machine I would call it your cold um your cold emails. There's your email and um and then number four is just um the process to respond. So, um, the process, which is really related to like what do you have a sales development rep do it's so simple, it's really simple. You email people, they respond, you reply back, you follow up with them, and um, how good your follow-up process is really determines the total pipeline value that you generate. So, this is so easy. So um the first should we go should we just dive into number one? Yeah. Um if you want I I have an actual proper example. I didn't want to mention because it's uh still working on the back of my brain. It's not an offer yet but but you could use it. I mean there is nothing to hide. Um I we served the clients recently uh for very specific thing in e-commerce which I think can be it's kind of a product market fit because we built an automation system for a furniture brand to to go go and and scrap uh trendy pieces of furniture images. Yes. generate uh image variations based on current traits. Yeah. AI image variations and inject them in their ad accounts. Yes. So it it runs like it's a test testing at scale. Basically it uh it's uh uh reduces the risk of uh choosing the the next product to launch because there is a it's like your rapid feedback method but for a testing product at scale basically with AI image generation. I love I was thinking okay so that that is is very specific but probably there are plenty of brands out there that really want that. I made some research and I figured I looked at all the categories. There are a few but probably the home decor furniture area is is the most likely to want that. So this is just to give you more context so to work with it's like okay what if we want to sell that how precise do we address the the the people like what kind of brand and how okay yeah this is a great qu very common question too like um so for you it's it's still new like you proved out that this was useful to a person and you know it would be valuable to another company like for sure right another ecom brand of Of course they would they could kill with ads doing that. It would be great. If you want to if you're coming from the point of view like I want to sell exactly that then probably you should run ads. Probably because you're going to um you know and you can run your standard funnel metrics and and and you'll be able to see like okay what kind of um cost per lead and cost per call do I need for this product? Like how do I need to price it for the whole thing to work? And um with some ad spend you could figure that out. This approach is more like how do I get a hold of ecom brand owners and have a conversation with them. How well you do in your sales process depends on are you did you connect your services with their needs. Um so maybe this is another point in here that actually number five is like how do you actually sell stuff if you're doing indirect um sales? How do you actually sell stuff? Why ads for for you said you should write run ads. Why would you say for this one if I let's say I want to okay tomorrow that's my only job I need to make this offer work. Yes. Okay. Ads I know how to do it. But why would I pick ads instead of coordinates for this specific thing? Okay. If it's it's like this is my thinking. If you are dead set on selling one specific thing, then ads are a great way to tell if that offer works because the ad platforms are going to help you optimize to put your messaging in front of people who might buy that thing. And you pay a premium to make that happen at scale. But you're saying, "Hey, Meta, I will pay you a premium to find the top 3% of the market that's ready to buy something today. I've advertised it the best I can. Let's see what it costs me to get a customer and do my unit economics make sense for this offer. So that's what is the benefit of using um Meta or whatever ad platform is you're paying for finding the right people and that's if you're starting from your offer your your starting point is like I want to sell XYZ then ads are great. The cold email is great if you're saying I want to get a hold of 7figure ecom brand owners. Now once as you know as a marketer it's a this is a different question as a marketer um you you know this you have to have someone's attention before you can sell them anything. So this is a great way like imagine how many ads you'd have to run if you only wanted to hit seven figure eight figure ecom brand owners a lot of ads. But here, if you offer somebody something really valuable, they will talk to you. Now, now you have someone's attention that owns a sevenfigure brand. What are you going to do with that attention? Are you going to say, "Hey, please buy my super specific point solution." Or are you going to say, "I put all this effort into it. Tell me about like what's what's your problems? What what's your like what's broken in your business right now? Why aren't you scaling?" Oh, it's that it's it's uh something to do with logistics or operations. That's what they want to buy today. And that's that helps inform what you can sell to that market, which is a different question, right? It's different like how do I sell my stuff, run ads, how do I get a hold of very uh affluent people who have problems. This is why cold email is great, but it doesn't help you sell exactly your thing. Maybe you talk to 20 um of them and they say actually we don't want that at all. That's not our problem this year. That would be a distraction for us because we need uh something else. That's very interesting. I didn't see that this way because on the contrary I was thinking okay if you do call the mail then you know I was saying okay if if I have this offer then I make it very specific to home decor brands and I talk about their next uh um product launch or you know something very specific so I I have their attention like that but in fact my thinking was more like the try try to buy my stuff instead of let's talk Yes. And so, and it really depends on the value of your solution. So, what I found like rough rule of thumb, rule of thumb, rule of thumb is if you're um and this is just like entrepreneur advice, right? So, if you're trying to start a new thing, um that should be an expensive thing. Very lowcost products are for massive scale, right? They're but they usually don't make a lot of money. So, and they're really difficult. They're really difficult. And I like to think about like this. Who serves the mass market? Massive enterprises are who serve the mass market. Walmart, Costco. If you want to sell a c one candy bar, then you need to be Walmart to make that make sense. So if your business is like, I'm going to sell this cheap little thing and but I just have to have 40 million customers and then I'll be my business. That's really hard. So we go the other way. When you're starting something new, it's got to be expensive unless you already have a huge business and now you're trying to uh expand. So that's cheap stuff is for massive scale. Um and so if yeah, if you're starting something, it's expensive. So um there's two like two ways I like to do. How do you sell how do you start selling an expensive thing? You can if it's hard, if it's not related to an industry, if it's not like, yeah, ecom brand owners. If it's like very ultra specific, then run ads to a callunnel, get on the phone with them, find out their problem, adjust your product, sell the solution. If it's something for an industry and you're like, what do ecom people need? Then you use cold email. And generally, if your um if your solution generates somewhere around $10,000 a year in revenue, then cold email is great. If it's less, it starts to as very specific revenue. You mean revenue? Yeah. If if you can sell at least one time $10,000 over the course of a year. Yeah. Over the course of Yeah. It's okay. Yeah. Then it's worth it. Um otherwise it feels like a lot of effort you know because um uh and this is with specifically this I'm getting really in the weeds or jumping around but getting into like indirect offers. So like hey I'm offering you something valuable like I'll give you an example. Um somebody I was talking to recently they scaled their service business to 10 million uh a year. You want to know their ad strategy? Their their big marketing strategy? They invite the potential clients to dinner. They don't even pay for the meal. It's an expensive restaurant. They invite potential clients to dinner. It's a networking opportunity with other leaders in their local area. That that scaled to 10 million. 10 million is so simple because you know why they want people want networking opportunities. If you're a CEO, you want to talk to other CEOs and it's a pain to you know organize. So it is valuable, right? This is very similar if you're offering indirect value to people. um uh this is kind of how you do it, but it does take effort. You do have to spend time with them. So, you're not going to it does have a sales process. This isn't like you're gonna click buy to get a great response rate on email. You have to offer something and and have a human touch and do sales. So, you're not going to want to do that for really lowcost products. around $10,000 um and and a reasonable TAM, you know, reasonable like number of people in your industry, you could be generating like you know somewhere between like one and 100 million in pipeline um from running these kind of plays. Interesting. So for for the example let's uh let's say which which is actually um something that also in my mind there are not a lot of automations agencies for e-commerce and the the causes it's not that obvious that as obvious as for example generating leads or um but there are a lot of problem that can be solved with automations that's kind of my thing I create systems I create workflow I use like all kind of tools make.com and and obviously AI everywhere. Yes. And I solve problems for for e-commerce. But again, you know, that is very depend. Yeah. That's solution. That's it's unsellable apart from the fact like I'm selling systems. But I don't even know system. So the only very specific idea was the one I told you about which I think can resonate with people but in fact I can pretty much anything or consume on anything e-commerce uh systems workflow ads. So yeah you could launch a huge business with just this. So you would send cold emails to uh e-commerce. I can show you how to find them but there's there's special lists for e-commerce too. Um, you could find them on Apollo, even just e-commerce on Apollo. Offer them something extremely valuable that is personal where they're going to meet with you and whatever that is. Um, and we can talk about some of the options. Um, and you test them, right? You're testing your emails. You're testing like the copy that's going to get them in front of in front of you. So, you're going to start to optimize as you go through. And when we talk about ecom, you you'll easily find like 30 40,000 ecom CEOs at that level. So you'll be able to some of them will want to talk to you if you're offering them something that they already wanted. And because it's ecom, they want a specific angle like there's a way that makes sense to them. And so that's kind of what you work on with your email. Get in front of them. You just figure out then it's sales. It's like uh and it's easy sales because you you have this great rapport from providing them value first. You find out like what is the problem they're facing right now that's related to what you do. You could ask them questions about, you know, their operations challenges and like why aren't they like what the funny thing, you know, as as marketers like for us, marketing is easy and you know what's hard is operations and hiring. That's a and culture those are much harder um problems. Um you know people think it's like lead flow and it is true. You can 10x leads and 10x a business but it's the it's the other parts the ops that breaks. So you can ask them these ops questions and then all you have to do is tailor your the way you provide what you do to their problems. So if they, you know, whatever it is. Gotcha. Yeah. All right. Sales. Yeah. It's basically a lot about sales, but you you first engage into a call with them. And I think that's the really the first step I I really would like to. Okay. Okay. So shall I show you all the tricks? Yes, Chris. Okay, I'm all else. Okay, so the first thing like let's just look for what, you know, one easy leads database would be Apollo. Um, uh, okay. So, I'm in Apollo. I'm sharing my screen, I hope, right now. So, here's Apollo. It's dark mode. That's how you know I'm a professional. And we're we have to find um so there's like you know Apollo lets you just search people and there's like 30 million people in here. And do you want European ecom for you? Yeah, why not? Sure. So account location. We're going to put in Europe. Europe. European. How dated do you know where where this come from? I mean I knew never used it. Oh yeah. Is it is it like an actual valid database where I mean there are better ones that are more expensive but Apollo like a lot of them 80% of them are going to work. Um okay and then let's just like check this out. Industry and keywords is industry is ecom keyword ecommerce. Nope. Okay. Let's try a keyword then. Uh company keywords. Here's a keyword ecommerce please work. Okay, look at that. And you look at these companies not all of them are correct. DHL. Okay. Somehow u cuka I you know in a former life I bought a cucka robot. Those are like the like car paint your car you know robot. Obviously these are not all correct. Clara. Okay. Okay. I think they do like payment processing, right? Yeah. So, not all So, clearly not all of these are going to be correct, but a lot of them are. And that's the point. So, right here we have 43,000 companies in e-commerce, but let's, you know, let me tell you something. It's hard to sell to people that don't make money. So, let's filter at least 5 million in revenue. That's really shrunk it. Okay. I'm just looking at this number here. Okay. Yeah. It's because of the size of the screen, but Okay. Um it was like we were just looking at the number of people um here. So I'm I'm always looking at Oh, that was too much zoom. Uh okay. And so then we're going to go to people and let's see if we can even find So generally when I do one of these I like to find like 10k people, 15k people. That'll give you enough leads for a quarter. And for ecom I know there's separate leads databases you can use that are better than Apollo for that specific one. Um, but yeah, we don't want to talk to anybody. So, one of the easiest ones you could do for like if it's just all of ecom, let's just make sure they could potentially buy something from you probably up to here, right? Like VP head, then they got to go ask their parents for money or their their boss, right? So, we want to go uh maybe to there. So that gives us 20k folks in Europe somehow related to ecom lucern e-commerce for example. So okay and then um so basically we would pull all these leads um and and that's like a technical step too boring to go through but we that easy way. So here you would have 20k um leads that's enough to email for a whole quarter. Um, and going back to my extremely ridiculous list. So, we picked a ICP of just like executives in ecom, um, you know, for the tech setup, this stuff changes all the time. And, uh, as you, as you know, and so what works today might not be the best tech tomorrow, but like today we like to use instantly. Um, so instantly you can, um, so what I would do if I were you is I would buy maybe six domains to email from. Um, and I would put like three to six accounts on those domains. So I'd buy Google Workspaces for those accounts, load all that. Yeah. Yep. So it costs. It's not free. It's not free. It ends up costing between like uh Well, it depends. There's a lot of different things that can affect the cost, but um then um you have to make sure that you've got your deliverability stuff. There's a lot of tech things around how you set up these like specific things about the DNS. Um yeah, like it's very boring and there's a list somewhere out there. Yeah. Yeah. I I had to deal with that a bunch of time but yeah never really for for cold call and probably that's one of the parts I was really wondering about. Yeah. How hard it is and what are the shortcuts like uh do you know like there is there are there guys on on fiber up that are just like that go straight forward and set up the whole thing if you want or not very good. You know here's the funny thing. If you could do cold email really well, you can launch a $10 million business. So like the guys on Fiverr who are selling it don't know how or they would not be on Fiverr. This is the funny thing with marketing. You know what I mean? Like oh man, I this reminds me I you know um I talked to some founders and they their business was fixing people's funnels and there they never got their own funnel to work and they got business from cold calling. So you got to be really careful out there in the marketing world because there are people, you know, um, so Fiverr is not the place to find technical expertise for, but there's a way there's an easier way out of this. You can pay a premium and instantly will sell you like preconfigured domains. It's it's way more money, but they just they're ready to go. They've done all the right technical stuff. Um, they already have account names, so you'll be emailing us like Emily or Sarah or whatever, but that's fine. Um so yeah that all um that's one way around that problem. What what if you know just for the technical part Mhm. if I don't want to pay the the premium um instantly and I want to set it up myself where is the best place to go and learn about it. Uh then you should I mean you should well you should call me you particularly you should call me and I will help you. And I would say like to people out there like that is why businesses like mine exist. Like we're really good at this. We're on top. It's changing all the time because it's like a cat-and- mouse game with the providers and like what's spam and um we try to not spam by actually that's the trick. The non-tick trick is we try to do something valuable so it's not just like junk. Um but yeah, you it's changing all the time and I don't think there's an easy answer to that because if you find some course it might be out of date. Um, yeah, if you're a serious business, like just find a real marketer. Like, I'll do it for you. Happy to help you set it up. Um, right. Yeah. So, no good answer there. Um, yeah. So, then you then you get those uh domains, you warm them up for like two weeks, which is instantly takes care of that for you. It's very simple. Um, and then the real the real thing is like what do you offer? So, I'm going to grab my favorites. Where's my favorite book? Is it already on the desk? Yeah. Favorite example. the ultimate sales machine. So he was doing keynotes, right? And if you read this book, this guy was a genius with the 8020 principle. He was like 8020 my clients, 8020 my prospects. How do I make a pitch that no one gets bored and leaves? This these are great questions, you know. Um and it's not easy because what every business owner and product owner does is like, okay, then I sell my stuff. Like when do I sell my let's buy my stuff? And your prospect is not ready for that. and it's the wrong point of view. So, just flip it. Like what what will everyone in the ecom industry benefit from? So, what they would do is they would make a big and this still works. It's a lot of work though, but it's it's worth it. Um, what they would do is they would make a report on like what's the global pain, what's the global outlook in that industry and people want to come. They want like what how are farming equipment like how do like um capital equipment in farms are going to change in 2025 and like how you can better allocate like if you can do a report on that everyone that's managing farm operations is going to come to you they want that would be very useful that's an example of a of they actually did that one that's how I know that one um but so if you have valuable information to share um and give it away then that's that's one way to go so you could cold email and say, "Look, um, I'm I'm a top marketer. I've been talking with uh top ecom brands like Estee Lauder or I don't know. I mean, that's just that's a everyone recommends knows that one, right?" So, or other people online and we made this report for them about the trends coming up in digital advertising or that's already getting too specific. So, it's got to be like that something about the top trends and and what's happening with AI for example in the industry. can we come deliver the um keynote? We'd love to just do it for free for you guys and I'll also share everything I I've been learning when talking to um executives across the industry. If if you do that, some people are going to want to go. The problem is you can't that's not like you can't just AI that out. It has to actually be valuable. Um so that's one thing we developed that for companies. Um other things that work are asking them to contribute to an industry white paper. And here's why that doesn't work often. If you're just telling people that and you don't actually produce anything useful, it doesn't work later. This is kind of like how you can't escape brand. Like if you have a terrible brand online because you're trying for the cheap, quick, easy fix, your ads stop working, you know? And it's the same for cold. If you are doing great stuff online and you're providing everyone with some value, suddenly your ad performance goes way up and you don't have to do anything else. Same for your cold email responses. People will say yes because they see you doing good things. So, um that's the main trick is to not fake people and you will you'll win in the long term. Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, honesty, not everybody is uh has this value. At least I I do have it. Um but I I totally I'm 100% on the the side. Yeah. Um and so that's it. You you would come up with these things. You can um one thing I do for companies is we launch podcasts. Another great thing people love getting on podcasts. And it's not like and here's the trick. The trick is you don't launch a podcast for lead generation. You launch a podcast to be the leader in the space to step up and say, you know what, we're going to lead now online. We're going to be the ones who are thought leaders. And you don't do that by like I'll ghost write some thoughts. You go you go up there and by hosting everyone just like the dinner I talked about. It's the same idea. You're the guy hosting the dinner and that is a huge value to everybody but you're still seen as the host which is um makes everything else work easier. Okay. So that that would be it's I'm I'm trying to understand that your approach. Your approach is really so you don't sell an offer. You don't even talk about an offer. You just share value. But value can be made in different uh flavor. It could be like um here's a report I wrote basic about this because it solved this problem. So maybe you might want to do it but maybe it's too specific because you need a broad one for cold email broad. Yeah. Which is funny. I would have thought it would be it's the opposite of ads. It's the total so ads because the platform finds people for you. You want to be so specific because then they'll find the right people. There's no algorithm here. So you want to be very broad like because you want everyone to say yes, you know. So yeah. Yeah. And so so there is the the keynote thing but also podcast in this case your lead magnet or value that you deliver is basically to ask them to be on a podcast with you. Yeah. And that's how you start the conversation basically. Yeah. It's like come on my show. I want to highlight your experience as a leader in your field and I know what you've done like you know here's like you know we want to talk about your company what you guys are doing uh I want to talk about your history the things that you know as an experienced like pro in the field like let's share that with the wider community and the trick is to just do that like if you do that the whole business will take care of itself like if you just really deliver on the value like for real do try and serve the Everybody needs that. So in in my case, yeah, uh just creating a podcast. Yeah. that would and reach out Jack code to ecom business owners that are potentially cl could be potentially clients and just not talking about any um product just say okay let's go on a podcast with me let's uh let's talk about your business going through the whole podcast not asking them for anything and then so if you have a now that I know your problem, maybe you want to have another call and then we we can talk something like that. Exactly. Exactly. And it doesn't have to I mean and and it's just Yeah, that's 100% it. That's 100%. And if you really like overd deliver and you like you make them look great on the show, um you have a great conversation in terms of sales, you've already built rapport now. And it's not like, "Hey, how's the weather in Tucson?" That's not rapport. You know what I mean? you actually just spent an hour with them, you did something cool with them. You're going to help them with their personal branding, with their career. Um, and now it's like, yeah, you have a it's it's just now it's like regular traditional sales, but we we plugged in this amazing digital marketing scalable thing in front of it. So, you're getting this you're getting a stream of executives in your in the industry that you want to serve are talking to you, making friends with you. then just yeah figure out what you need to sell them and sell them. I mean that's that's pretty easy. Um because you I'm sure I know you can help them and you already have like you personally Steph you've got a great brand. Like your podcast is cool. Your sh your show is cool. It's great. I love it. And so um this will work way better for you than somebody has no brand. Like people are gonna be like, "Oh yeah, you you know that guy. I've seen what he does." Yeah. All right. And and on the other side of it, like let's say the podcast is kind of the the highest value that you it's broad enough. It's it's appealing to everyone, but it require a lot of I would have said the opposite because actually it's uh you need to be there all the time. So it's not that scalable. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But no, but when you do it for comp like when you here's how it works at scale. Here's what we do. Um, so at scale I mean I can record seven episodes. Oh jeez. Hey Jen and everything. Uh, no. Like you know at a bigger at a bigger company as you as you get going you hand this to your top sales guy and then he can't do anymore. Then you do you add a second one. You have two hosts. So you you can you could fill maybe two three BDM's calendar. So like when I work with like a hundred million dollar company where they have offices all over, we we can have different we actually can launch different shows for different niches, different verticals. Like if they do healthcare, we have the healthcare one, we have another one for finance or oil and gas with different hosts. So you can actually fill several different folks calendars to uh speed it up. And then and then you you know all my my fun retargeting tricks, you can just punch we have a podcast about it. That's right. Yeah. So, um, what I love to do is, so those clips, if you if you make some, let's just talk about this. Let's say you you make a great episode. You have a a cool, like you're so excited, you got this great guest on, that guest wants to be seen as a leader. So, you actually run their clip as an ad with no call to action. You just pump it out. Pump it out. And you're going to see like, can you get people to watch that whole 60-second clip? If that clip is about some super specific ecom operations thing, no one in the world is going to watch that unless they're in ecom operations. So, you just pump that clip out there. You make an enormous retargeting list that doesn't depend on the pixel, you know, doesn't depend on all these things. Now, you have your private retargeting list. Um, and then you can you can push um an offer to that retargeting list. And that's way cheaper than running cold traffic ads, you know, like so when I run cold traffic ads, I get somewhere between like $300 and $600 a book call. When I do this this method I just described, it's like 50 $50 and they've been watching me for five months. So it's very easy sale. Yeah, that's phase two of the plan. That's phase two. Yeah. But you have all these assets so you can use them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is so so smart. But I just wanted to to understand so if podcast is on one uh end of the spectrum maybe the easiest value is some kind of report. I was thinking while you are you were explaining it for example and tell me if it's if it fits or not but right now what some e-commerce owners mind is if they are in the US it's a tariff problem. Okay. Yeah. It's a mess. It's like hell. So they are probably not willing to do anything else than solving this problem right now. But that's not exactly what I do. So but hold on though. Let's say just Okay, you go. You go. Okay. No, but I I know I know I know what what you are going to say because I can I can lead with that with information variable about that and then go somewhere go towards some kind of other problems. But I was thinking something that is general because in Europe for example they don't have those problems and we were talking about Europe and something that every e-commerce wants is to increase bottom line revenue um and to streamline the business and automations are saving money but no one really knows where to apply AI agent quote unquote because it's a I mean I have a whole video about the hype Yes, AI engine but uh AI automation workflows no one knows really how to use it. So let's imagine a kind of reports that uh list the 10 best places to use AI in an e-commerce to streamline operation logistic marketing and and then increase bottom line revenue. Is that something that is general enough? Yes. Yes. But there's one tweak to make it work better. So that would say like that's like okay and it will probably perform okay. Um one level better is you get them to uh contribute to the report. So if you make the report broader, you can ask them for their insight. It's the same thing. You're appealing to their ego a little bit. You know, like we're making this big report. Um we only are talked to the top brands. We've already talked to your competitors, by the way, and we'd love to get your insights and I'd love to tell you like what everyone's saying off the record, right? If you do that, um, you will. And you really do that. That's the thing. You can't just fake it. You have to actually do it. So, if you do that, now you have a you have all of their brands associated with your report. Now, run an ad to that report. You know what I mean? That's it's the same thing. Just like the pocket, it's the same thing. You're it's way more valuable because it isn't this thing you made. They made it. Yeah. So, have your customers make your never just just just give a PDF or something like that. That's so 2020. That still works. Like I still do that sometimes, by the way. But this is better. Like if you want to get in front of them, this is better because then you have a chance to talk. Okay. And then you can do your sales motion afterward. All right. Cool. So, we have the list. Yeah. Then we have a a no for two two vian either podcast or a report about automations which appeal to every everybody but in both case we we engage conversation by asking them feedback and talking to the ego and and engaging conversation. So it's really not like a hey just consume my stuff and and come back to me. It's more like hey I need you to do something together. Yeah. Then starts the the sales process. So it's really engaging conversation. We said the the technical part it's like it's a whole other thing. Yeah. Like it needs to be learned specifically for that. Yeah. So what what do we miss then? Where where are we in the the process? Uh well we didn't cover like SDR and sales um Yep. stuff. There's a couple like little fine points too. So you have questions about the market. If you're having these conversations make sure that's in your list of questions like your hypothesis about what they want. ask like ask right like uh I know you like um quizf funnels you're a big quiz funnels fan this could be a little bit like a quizunnel right you're you're asking them about all those quiz questions you have that you want to like segment them just ask them in person and write it down and you've done the same work um so that's okay so so you are talking when you are in a conversation with them you need to have already like basically it's not a sales script but it's more like a um discovery. Yeah. List of question that you want to have kind of the some prepared because you know that they already lead to the big problems that are underlying. Yeah. Is that correct? Yeah. 100%. Yeah. And so like you know when I have clients that say you know I want to sell my thing um I coach them to make sure they're asking the their their guests and and who they're talking to like what is it you want to buy this year? like what's you know that's a much more valuable question than how do I get you to buy my thing? Um and we go the other way. Go the other way. What what this is the question I'm asking every day. How do I sell the stuff that people just want to buy? I mean that's way easier than how do I market this like thing that's not cool anymore and like repackage it and try and make the angle. It's just sell what they want. This is Yeah. But yeah. Okay. Okay. It works. But I know I totally get it. Uh and and I have seen it working first time. I mean I'm really not a sales guy. That's why I'm kind of biased because my background is in e-commerce and it's more like okay we have the product like let's make it nice and sell it. Yeah. Um but I've had the chance to to work with some great marketers that knows about the sales process. I've been in those discovery calls and and I know that you know the big difference is like okay going to what do you need and then okay let's just figure out if we can solve this problem for you and then when we create an offer the offer is like okay it's exactly the solution you you need so so why why wouldn't it's it's not like a no I don't want it it's like maybe there is a negotiation about how long to to it how how much how much does it cost but can't be a no because it's exactly what they do. But what if you have a problem? Sometimes it's a no, but yeah, unfortunately. I wish it I wish it couldn't be a no, but it's still sometimes you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. But what if, for example, you have a productized service? Yeah. Yeah. Then then there is no such a thing as custom and what do you need? I would do it. How do you manage that? Okay. This is a like this is a sales or even even even a SAS business. Yeah. Here we go. Well, I I like to help people who sell expensive SAS. There's always a little something, right? That's definitely it's not uh it's not like $1 a seat, you know, five seats. Um then I can't help you. But um so yeah, that's like a sales question. If you have a productized service, your clients don't care that you've made your operations efficient. They don't care. They don't care at all. So all you just have to connect. You're like, "Yeah, you have this specific problem. Here's exactly how we solve it. We do it. We solve it. You know, you said a we that's our offer. Like we fix a we get you to Hawaii." No one cares about how, right? It's like the selling the sell the vacation, not the flight. Don't talk about your packing your bags and getting on the plane. Just talk about like orchids and surfing on Maui and like beach breaks and all that stuff. Um so yeah. Uh and so you they don't you don't have to talk about your productized service. You just deliver you just have great like margins. That's they don't care though. Yeah. But how how how I you know I ask a lot of questions. So hear me. Sorry you you tell me if if you want to to to move on faster if you do co emails with a productized service. Yes. It means that you don't want to go into like I don't know uh 50 cop sessions a a week with people that don't need your product or service. So you absolutely have to make sure they need this specific. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. Let me talk about that's like are they qualified or not. So when you're emailing people who might not uh might not need your service, you're going to have a lower qualified rate. And that's why I say like for this to make sense generally just typically across all industries. If you're selling something that costs 10 grand or more and a lot of like 60% of people might need it, it's going to work. Um but that's that kind of makes sure the juice is worth the squeeze that sort of uh annual contract value. So if it's that or higher, it's fine. Um and that's why it's like yeah, you definitely like if two people were playing this game, the offer would win, right? If you if one guy was selling something that like most people didn't want, the other guy's doing the exact same marketing, but he's selling something that everybody needs, okay, that other guy's going to win. So, the offer wins in this case. You are going to get lower amount of qualified people uh just because it's random. Maybe they didn't need it this year, but then that's where sales comes in. You have that great conversation. Maybe next year they need something and you're the guy that helped them. Long game. It's a long game. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's the that's the obscure part that I am not too much aware and I really need to learn into. Well, Steph, this has been really fun and I have to run interview people um because we're growing and yeah, let me know if I can if that's the next call is interview. You're so busy. I know. I know. Well, thank you. Thanks for coming on. It was a lot of fun. Yeah, I learned a lot. Um, and then we we might uh I might call you again to to talk about it again. But uh yeah, thank you very much. You're welcome. Ciao. Bye. Have a good one.
