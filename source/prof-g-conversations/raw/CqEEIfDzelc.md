the widening inequality both on the wealth side and the income side although on the income side it surprisingly got better post pandemic with a lot of kenian fiscal stimulus we weren't all that far from a president Bernie Sanders that that could have happened I think a president AOC is a genuine issue at least for the 0.1% and I'm not I'm not referring to the carried interest deduction or any of the other loopholes I'm talking about hey guess what there's going to be a new tax bracket and if you make $10 million a year uh there's an alternative minimum tax and you're going to pay [Music] it Barry where does this podcast find you uh I'm sitting at 7:31 Lex in my regular podcast Studio at Bloomberg I think you were some of the first podcasts I ever came on at Bloomberg I mean I remember coming in there seven eight years ago yeah you're a great interviewer so uh let's bust right into it your book how not to invest is out next week in it you group common investing mistakes into three kind of three buckets bad ideas bad numbers and bad behavior break these down for us sure so so first we have a century of books telling us what to do and despite I don't know tens of thousands of books most people are still pretty mediocre investors so so I took a page from the two Charlies Charlie Ellis who compared investing to tennis most people are not professional tennis players professionals win by scoring points amateurs lose by unforced erors and uh if you just bring that approach to investing and say rather than try and find the next Nvidia or jump in and out of the market before and after the next crash how about we just make fewer mistakes and it turns out that puts you 90% ahead of everybody else and the other Charlie is Charlie Munger who in his inimitable fashion was asked are you and Warren smarter than everybody else is that why you're so successful and Munger responded no we're just less stupid less stupid is better than smarter uh at least in investing so when I was trying to put the book together I just started thinking about all the errors I had come across over 30 years and they neatly fit into we believe things that aren't true we don't understand the numbers that Drive the markets the economy investing and then we engage in behavior that is super self-destructive you mentioned that you never planned on becoming a wealth manager but we're driven by frustration with wall Street's practices what are some of those practices that are kind of potentially put a money manager or Wall Street not on the same side as its investor base so I didn't go to business school I went to law school and a big part of the legal education is understanding your fiduciary obligation to your clients your ethical obligation uh something similar applies to accounting uh to the medical practice doctors have a similar obligation to their patients and yet money is so important to our Safety and Security and financial well-being our retirement our our what we pass down to our children and to our philanthropy but the rules were such that there's no no greater obligation to you from traditional Financial practice than you get from a used car salesman it it made no sense to me wait you just can't misrepresent that the transmission is bad um and other than that it's an arms length transaction that never made any sense you can just do what you want to do with the client Harvest their organs sell them on the black market that's fine it simply was consistent with all the other professional relationships we had and following the financial crisis which I more or less got the top and bottom right lots of people started throwing money at me I wasn't comfortable referring those people to other places and I wasn't comfortable even at the firm I was at at the time uh cuz they were a little bit you know it's called a hybrid Model A little bit of a fiduciary except when it's inconvenient then they swap hats and suddenly they can just be a a broker and and maximize profits and it was really out of just absolute frustration all right we can't turn these people loose to the Wolves let's see if we can give them a provide a service that puts them first and you know over the past 20 years Wall Street has slowly drifted in that direction it's still not quite all the way there but it's much further along than it was 10 15 years ago so I want to put forward and by the way Barry and his partner Josh and I get together not regularly but we do get together and they kind of save Me For Myself I want to throw out a couple thesis around biases or some of the things that have haunted me in terms of investing and have you comment on them and then just some general structural uh Impressions or thoughts uh the first is that your emotions are your enemy and that is when I get hurt really badly I'm just like I can't take any more pain I want to sell when I do my greed glands get going and I start thinking about Levering up with margin because I start believing I'm actually good at this and I find and I have to check myself I think of that Seinfeld episode where George castanza decides to do everything that he instinctively he does the opposite of what he thinks he should do and his life gets much better I feel like your your emotions and sometimes your instincts are your worst enemy around investing what are your thoughts so think about why we even have a a limic system and and a migd and an emotional response to external input uh humans now dominate planet Earth wasn't always that way we're we're soft chewy delicious creatures without fangs or claws or armor so yeah so we're super vulnerable and we developed a series of sub routines that allowed us to not only stay alive but adapt and Avent dominate the planet and what kept you alive on the Savannah is your fight ORF flight response the ability to quickly identify a Potential Threat and respond in the most effective way that turns out to be great uh if you're a biological organism that's constantly under threat but making risk reward decisions in the market it's it goes right to Danny Conan's Thinking Fast and slow Thinking Fast keeps you alive thinking slow is how you make money in the markets and emotions your your limic system are clearly part of that thinking fast I love the quote from Dr William Bernstein former neurologist and Doctor Who became an investor he said your entire level of success as a uh investors determined by your limic system if you can't get that under control you will die poor and that is really quite the warning about emotionality and investing you've actually been an advocate and have been pretty vocal about saying investors are better off buying index funds rather than trying to pick individual stocks uh and yet you're you're a money manager and you make fees I trying to find Alpha I think help me reconcile why you tell your clients not to just go invest in Vanguard we well we we're big Vanguard investors we're Vanguard Wisdom Tree Black Rock our approach is a combination of core and satellite Where The Heart of the investing are pretty broad indexes um us total Market uh xus developed some uh Emerging Markets the idea is look look at this is a example recording this uh towards the end of the first quarter and the US is up a percent or two Europe is up 15% so when you're Diversified over a long period of time uh different parts of the world are going to do better or worse and that's the core you that should lock the beta in for your portfolio beta being take what the market gives you and be happy the satellite are all the things you do around that so if you believe in momentum or value or maybe you like technology or India or you know there's a thousand different variations think think of it as the Christmas tree is the core index the Garland and all the ornaments are the stink you put on your portfolio with uh those satellite things however you want to flavor it you could do that there are some other Technologies and some other things that we really like that helps us find tax Alpha and we're also big Believers in what we call advisor Alpha which is what can we do to prevent investors from hurting themselves so we have a very simple tactical model uh that we put a small percentage of the portfolio in and its purpose is not to generate Alpha its purpose is to prevent people from touching their real money when things get hairy as we've seen the past week or two we don't learn this lesson but whenever ever met with you and Josh you guys is drilling home and that is people I think one of the most underappreciated strategies for a risk adjusted return and also limiting your emotional um downside is diversification it's so boring and yet I just don't think most of us really think about how powerful it is and really add up our assets and say okay if I've got 90% of my wealth in my home and my vacation home that's probably not a great idea or if I've got at some point us growth will slow down or US tech growth I my my two biggest mistakes I've been wealthy three times which means I've lost it all twice and the reason I lost it all twice and it was hugely emotionally and mentally trying was I didn't appreciate the power of diversification I was always highly levered to US tech and so what do you know in 20 in 2008 I was no less a person or no Dumber I just got wiped out talk about the power of diversification and why we just naturally don't learn that lesson sure so so there are two emotional impediments to being and staying emotionally divers uh investwise Diversified the first is being Diversified means there's always something in your portfolio that's not doing well you know the past C decade it's been uh Europe Europe has wildly underperformed suddenly Europe is now doing much much better than the US value has done really poorly over the past decade in large part because of the shift in markets away from hard Industries and towards uh intellectual property and value at least as historically described hasn't adjusted uh so when you're looking at your portfolio and why is my emerging markets doing poorly and why is this value sleeve underperforming it's very easy to get frustrated and walk away from that the the second factor is we all have a tendency to tack into to lean into whatever is working so for the past decade technology has been great just as it was in the 90s but at a certain point those things come to an ends every cycle turns every bull market ends every bare market ends every period of economic expansion eventually hits a recession and so one of the free lunches and there aren't many on Wall Street one of the free lunches is occasionally rebalancing uh towards a core set of um allocations so that one part of your portfolio doesn't run a muck and suddenly half of your exposure is to or or more is to technology we regularly see people come into the office who 10 years ago took a flyer on Nvidia or apple or Amazon and they're paralyzed because 34s of a not insubstantial chunk of wealth is one company and that single stock risk not everything is going to be a Leman brothers and go to zero but look at General Electric you know the one of the most beloved stock Cisco of yeah oh Cisco I have a whole chapter onison 99 to 2001 lost 90% of its value right it was single digits people forget uh Amazon was trading for single digits so you give up you willingly give up potential upside in a single stock because for many we have no minimums in the FM so we have people with $50,000 we have P people with 50 million when you hit a certain point you have to recognize hey I won there's no reason to take all this additional risk let's trade off upside in exchange for steady ready gains without the possibility of a 90% collapse we'll be right back couple more thesis we've talked about index funds and fees I still don't think the market is really cognizant of how much of your turn fees will eat up and I would argu I'll put forward a thesis that the alternative investment community and I would say a good 50% of my friends are in this community who recognize the most extraordinary gains relative to their talent and by the way they're exceptionally talented but from kind of 1995 to 2015 I think that 20-year period will be remembered as the period where this a small group of people made more money on a risk adjusted basis than any sector in history I had friends who were good hardworking head you know work at hedge funds and the good hardworking people in other industries were making 200,000 to 2 million a year and they were making 20 to $30 million a year and then that came to an end or slowly but surely I would say the majority of them are even out of the business over the last five or 10 years they've stayed in the business but their aum's gone from you know 3 billion to 300 million and my thesis is that the alternative investment sector could best be described that's mutual funds hedge funds as San Francisco real estate and that is expensive but bad and that is the returns have been in stocks that everybody knows so no one's going to pay you 2 and 20 to buy Nvidia and they've been left trying to find Alpha in a a narrow part of the market and they've just vastly underperformed I think the now shows if you added up all the people on CNBC who come on and Pitch stocks they have perform the S&amp;P by the amount of their fees isn't this arguably one of the biggest griffs in economic history the alternative investment Community the financial times called the hedge fund a scheme to transfer money from uh naive investors to Savvy managers and I think that overstates it a little bit you know the Golden Age of hedge funds was pre-reg FD where you could have an information Edge and before quants were really everywhere um to say nothing of the few quants that really put up killer numbers in the 80s 90s and and 2000s right up to the financial crisis Jim chanos has a wonderful quote in the book when he started it in the 1980s there were 100 hedge funds and they all create Alpha today there's 11,000 hedge funds and more or less those same hundred are the ones that generate Alpha so my thinking on Alternatives has evolved if you could get into uh the elite hedge funds the top let's call it desile the de shores of the world if they're willing to take your money and it's their money-making fund not their secondary under any hedge fund that's successful always rolls out a you know a plan B for the masses and it never does as beautifully as as the first one does yeah that's a great opportunity what we've seen since the financial crisis and the of zero interest rate has been a shift in assets instead of flowing into hedge funds and and they're still going in to some degree it's $3 trillion dollar they have moved to private credit and private equity and that seems to be the alternative that if not generating Alpha over and above what the market does at least they can make a plausible case that it's not correlated and it's Diversified we're not putting money into publicly traded stocks we're not putting money into bonds we are buying credit and or private companies and therefore under uh exposed to the equity markets at least that's a plausible argument I'm not so sure I fully buy into all of it but it's a better argument then I'm going to aggressively trade on a leverage basis public equities I I still can help at stock pick and I want to put a couple of my core thesis out there and have you respond to them one is regarding what you said about Europe and every year at the end of the year I predict make a bunch of predictions one of my predictions in 20 in November of 20 24 was that we were finally going to see the flows the rivers reverse and that is someone told me that if you add it in debt the US market accounted for 70% of the world's value uh that it was just if it just equities it's 50% but you had in debt the total value of the world if you put a price tag on it is represented 70% of that is the US and I thought okay if I could buy the US for $70 or the rest of the world for 30 I would buy the rest of the world for 30 and so I've started rotating out of us growth and into value some in latam some in China and some in Europe and I read that us growth is at 98% meaning on a scale of 1 to 100 it's only been more expensive 2% of its history and and this is about a month old so I'm sure it's changed but European value was at 2% meaning 98% of its history had had been higher so granted this is just stock picking on a more metal level but doesn't the US just generally speaking and I'm curious if you're telling your clients this just look overvalued so let's start 30,000 ft and and drill down um first you have that itch and the advice we always give people with that itch is set up a separate Cowboy account put five or 10% of your money into it and pick stocks to your hearts Del light who cares fun five to ID 30 5 to 10% all right well you know you're you're risking another 20089 if you blow up five or 10% who cares it it hurts but it it's not fatal so that that's number one number two sometimes stocks are expensive were cheap for a reason you could look back for the past 15 years other than really briefly after the financial crisis it's hard to say US Stocks have been cheap anytime in the past 10 15 years they're expensive for a reason it's the highest profit growth it's the best or at least it was up until the craziness we're dealing with now with tariffs and and all sorts of other potential risk R Raisor but when you when you look around around the world Europe has a structural problem and and has had that problem for a long time we have a lot of advantages we have the reserve currency you know it's not a coincidence that all of the big tech companies primarily start here I have a vivid recollection of a business trip in 2000 to London and Brussels and in the US during the collapse you walk down the streets in Manhattan the fear was palpable [ __ ] if I get fired I lose my health care my kid can't get that surgery Cobra is crazy expensive I'm screwed in Europe it was kind of like well I got unemployment my student loans I don't have student loans my education is paid for my retirement is paid for my health care is paid for all right so we have a recession who cares the flip side of that is you don't get the you know the the Larry Ellison's the Bill Gates the Steve Jobs in Europe the way you get them here so so sometimes stocks are cheap for a reason and they can stay cheap for far longer than than we would expect um 98 is is kind of a warning so so that's number one number two I'm not a fan of putting money into China because they basically say if you're not a local Chinese investor you're a second class Citizen and I think the numbers are from 1989 to 2023 you're essentially flat in China I mean you missed two of the greatest bull markets in history and China gave you nothing because the B shares don't trade the same way the a shares do and and there's a lot of friction unlike in the US so I know everybody seems to think China is the big winter it turned out the way to get exposure to China was not through putting money into China but buying Australia who who supplied a lot of energy a lot of Commodities a lot of things to China and did really well on a much more steady basis without the government's the Chinese centrally planned government putting a thumb on it but the other aspect and you and I have talked about what I'm about to say before most investors never find their Edge right 90 Plus % of us we have some idea as to what's going on but really not a full understanding we're we're overconfident we're arrogant we suffer from all the done and Krueger effects and so we make bad decisions but some of us and I include you in that group have an edge you have an expertise digital marketing uh content creation um look at look at your successful history on the entrepreneurship side if you can trade your expertise for entree into some of these Alternatives where you're getting a hey let's swap I'll swap my not charge you a fee and you don't charge me a fee that's a tremendous advantage that you should be very comfortable taking advantage of when I you know I first found you because of your presentation on the four which became the book the four and it was clear to me that you had a huge insight into these companies even as as late as the early 2010s I would say check yourself and say do I still have the advantage that I had when I bought these companies at a fraction of where they are today let me ask you this there's two big exogenous factors that I think you have to acknowledge and maybe adjust for it I'm curious what how you're adjusting your clients portfolio so these two opportunities RIS whatever you want to call it the first is the Trump Administration and all that brings kind of you know America First generously or tariffs what however you want to frame it and to AI how are you adjusting your clients's portfolios based on those two factors so let's start with AI first you know and and you and I are not that far apart age-wise so we've lived through the financial crisis we've lived through the dot implosion what happened with the internet I think we're both old enough to remember when computers desktop computers first came out and there's this sort of land rush and by the way this has happened with every technology go back to telegrams radio telephones um computers internet AI is no different there's a rush to try and find the winners the nvidias but what ends up happening is we're not a DOT company but every modern company today has a website has email uses business intelligence and connectivity to make themselves more efficient more productive more profitable so with AI the thought process is is Invidia too expensive is it too cheap when does Netflix um and it's and Microsoft and Apple when do those companies achieve uh full value overvalue I don't know I have no idea people have been betting that it was over for forever and and they've been wrong to me what makes AI so exciting isn't the Magnificent 7 it's the other 493 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that every single one of them is going to be using artificial intelligence to make themselves more productive more efficient uh more profitable and that's the upside sure Nvidia is a 3 tril trilon dollar company is it going to be a four or a five or six trillion I haven't the slightest idea but I can tell you the rest of the S&amp;P 500 is going to benefit from Ai and become much more productive so that's that's your second question first the Trump issue is kind of fascinating because uh there are two sides to this and you have to be able to hold two conflicting thoughts in your head at once the first is if I'm investing for retirement generational wealth transfer philanthropy um I'm thinking out 10 20 30 years I'm certainly Thinking Out Beyond 2028 and so you have to kind of tune out the noise and look past all of the craziness that's going on today but the flip side of that and and you know I've never met a one-handed Economist it's always on the one hand and on the other hand but the flip side of that is there can be no doubt that risks are rising this is the piece I put out last Monday uh and we identified seven areas where the possibility of risks they're still low but they're higher than they were uh before January 20th and that includes the risk of a recession the risk of a contraction in the economy the the risk of a volatility Spike which we've already seen we're now over 23 which is a big relatively um higher number not high enough to say GE I got to start buying with both hands but it's above where we were that was kind of steady um I'm concerned about the risk of the rule of law I don't understand this nonsensical C strategic crypto reserve the world using the US dollar as the reserve currency of choice is been called America's exorbitant and privilege why on Earth would you do anything to put that at risk Sam why is it why do it put at risk with the the Bitcoin Reserve why would you want to create an alternative to the dollar and endorse that it it you know I if you have an asset that's enormously valuable you don't want to do anything to screw that up and arguably I try and think of um Bitcoin as like a large tech company it's halfway between um Facebook and Google to put it into context at like a trillion 7 trillion 8 it's right in between the two of them um although Bitcoin came out a year or two after the iPhone the iPhone is ubiquitous and and indispensable we're still waiting for Bitcoin to actually become have utility yeah an actual functionality but back to the question about Trump and tariff and layoffs at the federal government you know we're sort of in a a a wait and see will will these things withstand judicial scrutiny do they actually have the authority to not spend money that Congress authorized there's a lot of questions but you can't just completely tune everything out you have to be aware we're seeing risks rise we're seeing the possibility of recession increase I'm not a giant fan of the various Federal Reserve GDP um real time measures before you get the quarterly update but the Atlanta fed's GDP now just printed yesterday negative 2.8% for q1 GDP that's the first two months or so of data imply that we're going to be in a contraction when all these tariffs and all these um layoffs get calculated in q1 that's obviously a substantial risk you just can't tell how much of this is negotiating how much of this is going to go in effect we're recording this 12 hours after the tariffs went into effect the first time they were postponed I I'm hoping I a little wishful thinking on my part that this will be negotiated away but in the meantime you know the Market's still within 5% of its all-time highs it's a little early to panic but it's not too early to say gee this is starting to get a a little more volatile and a little more choppy and lots of areas that have been pretty you know sedate and operating properly are now starting to tick up they're still low but they're much higher than they were uh four weeks ago 6 weeks ago we'll be right back so I can't help it I want to talk about individual Theses looking for looking for Alpha and get your response I'm wondering I'm trying to find the silver lining and basically America abandoning and its allies with respect to to to Ukraine and uh ignoring 80-year-old alliances with huge economies in Europe and I'm obviously laying be my political bias here but it just seems insane to me and the Silver Lining I see is that the Europe is about to substantially increase its military spending and I see that possibly as a form of stimulus not only economically but it might inspire a decent amount of um technology spill over into the private sector if you look at Israel spending on the military obviously the US is spending on Military I would argue that on the whole You could argue in addition to the actual defense um buttressing it's been in many ways good for the economy long term I think of basically the most valuable companies in the world have just built a thick layer on top of Technology Innovation that originally came out of the defense sector do you think that there's a possibility and this is me trying to talk myself into the the fact that Europe becomes a union again spends more in Military and that it kind of ignites through stimulative impact and a kind of a inspiration in its Tech sector that Europe might become a union and this might kind of set off not only leadership where they kind of command the space they own largest economy in the world take as a whole but it might be a starting gun for kind of a bull run in Europe or am I just am I just painting a story to make myself feel better here we have a tendency to think of the world in black and white and and we've you know binary terms and it's never that clearcut it's always nuanced and complex and so you're you're touching on a couple of really interesting things so so let me caveat this by saying I am neither a defense expert nor a foreign policy expert nor a geopolitical expert doesn't stop me Barry stop being so [ __ ] measured just make the Clara of State it well that's where I was going with this um where I was going in One Direction but pretend we're on CNBC just say [ __ ] like it's it's God's gospel so so the funny part about what you're saying is this chapter in the book called epistemic trespass and experts in one area have a tendency to believe that their expertise right the in fact it was Professor Dunning who turned introduced me to Nathan Ballentine at Arizona University univers that who who's the expert on epistemic trespass what happens when people with legitimate expertise in one area bleed over to another and the answer is exactly what you would think they're terrible in those adjacent spaces but all that said um I think the Nuance of the realignment is such that Europe has been skating by Under the NATO uh Alliance and the American leadership and umbrella and while it certainly appears to be um an unforced self error you know your own accidentally own goal by giving that up the United States giving that up it it is going to make Europe um much more cohesive much tighter and whereas we used to be the counterpart the offset to the Soviet Union now Russia uh Europe is going to become that so so that's the the first part the second part that's kind of interesting there's an amazing article in the New York Times yest yesterday about not only how Bloody and horrific the war in Ukraine has been but how over the course of three years the casualties the uh injuries and and deaths are now 70% inflicted by drones the old regime of tanks and artillery and expensive aircraft has moved to a totally different type of warfare it's no longer locked Martin it's now palente here it's that sort of shift and so whereas we have whereas we have all of these Legacy issues those other uh companies and and to some degree the new European alignment are are not stuck with that and so it potentially can kick off a whole new wave of of innovation not just in defense but other areas we see it in the US we see it in Europe I can't imagine the United States is going to sit by and let Europe sell all these expansive profitable weapons to everybody else they'll they'll have a lead if we back off and so it's really hard to judge how any of these things are going to work out there's always ramifications and unintended consequences and Reflections it's not just that I think um I don't know what's going to happen geopolitically but it's never clean and neat there's always so many variables which is why predicting the future has become all but impossible uh a thesis I want you to respond to this when we talked about this when we were at dinner I've determined that the the 0.1% all want to live in a handful of places Dubai London New York Palm Beach Aspen some in LA and then I'm sure there's one city in Asia I'm missing do you think there's a strategy or do you think it makes sense to invest or what I've been doing is I've been buying real estate in those places do you buy into this 0.1% strategy as an investment thing well on the one hand we just got the most recent data that says half of consumer spending in the United States are driven by the top yeah it's it's it's Bonkers and you know when you have a certain amount of money you become pretty price and sensitive um I jokingly if you've ever dealt with a contractor in the Hamptons I'm assuming it's the same in Aspen I know it's the same in Manhattan crazy there's a Hampton's tax that you're going to pay crazy um and that's the contractors know they can market up uh and so they they want a part of that that's the one hand what we talked about at dinner with the and we've talked about this for years the widening inequality both on the wealth side and the income side although on the income side it surprisingly got better post pandemic with a lot of keian fiscal stimulus we I mentioned unintended consequences earlier we weren't all that far from a president uh Bernie Sanders that that could have happened and as much as I see the farri right sniping at AOC it's completely understandable we were never close to a president Elizabeth Warren but but I think a president um AOC is a genuine issue uh at least for the 0.1% you're talking about and I'm not I'm not referring to the carried interest deduction or any of the other loopholes I'm talking about hey guess what there's going to be a new tax bracket and if you make $10 million a year uh there's an alternative minimum tax and you're going toay pay it and so the risk with all this Mania that that we're seeing now is um and the risk with uh wealth inequality is when the backlash comes I don't think the US is ever going to become a socialist or Communist Regime but we could go back to a 1950s or 60s era uh of Taxation that look you look at the history of taxes over the past Century indiv ual um Mom and popop citizens pay a much higher share today than they used to versus Corporate America and the top 101 or even 0.01% and uh don't be surprised if that pendulum swings the other way I'm not smart enough to figure out an investment thesis for that five years down the road um but it's certainly a factor that should be considered bar you've literally in you've literally interviewed 500 of the most successful investors or influential people in the world of Finance I mean you were sort of in this game of podcasting before it was cool what are the two or three things you've taken away not only around investing but kind of life lessons like what is I have a few lessons or sayings that I've always held on to that have been nice guiding lights for me what have what have those been for you the the single biggest one which kind of surprised me and and I'm pretty alert to false modesty when people are bullshitting blowing smoke up my um has been the role of luck and Serendipity in people's lives uh there were a group of a group of fund managers who as uh business school majors at Colombia carpooled together and it was like a crazy Leon cooperman and I'm trying to remember one of them told me like these four guys who all would go on to become billionaires were car pooling together at school and and one of them had said every person I went to school was as smart as me or smarter was as hardworking or or but sometimes they just didn't catch that break where they're in the right place right time at the right moment and things just fell their way and it you know if you hear it once or twice ah it's false humility stop when you hear it a hundred times from people who are just wildly wildly successful that's the the first thing that really stood out like luck really Hey listen hard work and smarts those are table Stakes that's just what it takes to enter the arena the second thing is and this really took me a while to ex like the luck thing I I got right away the second thing that really kind of surprised me is uh the concept of being grateful for what you have and look if you want to be miserable go to Zillow Circle the area around eastampton or Aman it and click sold and look at the houses that sold for 25 30 3540 million these aren't outliers this is like every other [ __ ] house is 10 20 $30 million your your head explodes and your first instinct is to say what the hell am I doing wrong in my life that I don't have access to one of those and then the second thought is because you didn't get lucky there you have a very nice house and a very nice car and a very nice this and that be grateful for what you have and stop comparing yourself to other people there's always someone with a bigger boat if that's your measure of success you're always going to be unhappy instead not to get you know Zen on
