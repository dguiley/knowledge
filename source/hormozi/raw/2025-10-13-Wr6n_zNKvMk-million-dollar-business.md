# Transcript: Building a $1,000,000 Business for a Stranger in 69 Minutes

This is Philip. He gave up a highpaying job in tech to start a garbage collection business. Last year, he lost $150,000. So, Philip has a wife and a kid and another baby on the way. And if he doesn't fix the business model fast, he'll put that growing family at risk. Hi, my name is Philip. I'm the owner of Garvey Disposal Services. We do residential trash, recycling, and yard waste collection. Our revenue is 642,000. Our net profit is -151,000. >> That's the wrong side. >> It is on the wrong side. >> All right. Our net margins are negative 23%. We've been in business for a little under two years and we currently serve 2500 customers. >> So what's the problem? >> We need to become profitable. >> We're not utilizing our assets enough. Trash is a very capitalally intensive business. >> Totally. >> One of our trucks is a half utilization. Routes are not super efficient. >> We've had lots of unexpected repairs. We need more leads. Scale up our doortodoor efforts. We need to scale up our meta ads efforts profitably though. >> Mhm. And we need more conversions on the HOA side and we need to increase our route efficiency. So, a lot of things we need to do. >> So many things. Why is solving this important? What happens if you don't solve this? I'm definitely in the thick of my rocky cut scene right now where um I left my highpaying job at Amazon as a software engineer to start this cuz I thought it was a great opportunity >> and I have been working 16 hours a day, 7 days a week for the past 2 years with really little to nothing actually negative to show for it. >> And I have a wife and a child at home and my wife is actually due in the next 6 weeks which props to me. So, I need to make sure that I'm able to provide for her and my daughter and uh the new baby, especially as you know, my wife won't be able to work. So, it's really crucial that we figure this thing out sooner rather than later. >> And I think we're really close because >> by my estimations, we 3,000 customers is going to be that critical mass point where we're going to start to make some money. >> Mhm. So, here's my promise to you, which I don't normally do. By the time you leave, you'll feel absolutely clear on what you need to do in order to be profitable. All right. So, I'll I'll stay as long as it takes to make sure that you're good. >> Okay. >> All right. Okay. All right. So, who do you help? >> Yeah. So, we have two types of avatars. 50% are what we call scatter. The other 50% are HOAs. And there's two different types of sales processes for these two types of customers. >> Yeah. What's the is there is there a difference in in like home value or income in the scatter versus HOAs? or HOAs t do they tend to be nicer than the other ones or >> we've had some HOAs that are lower income for sure >> and then we have some scatter customers that are much higher income that scatter group is is thinking about switching to be an HOA so >> typically it does correlate with income the HOAs are higher income >> in general right I think there's going to be a big strategic decision that we're going to have to make that you're probably not expecting and it's around >> it's around who the avatar is. So we'll talk more about that. The second thing is going to be how you acquire them. So how do you help them? >> Okay, so we have two different types of services for two different customers. So our scatter customers have once weekly trash, recycling, and yard waste collection. >> Most don't have an existing contract, >> so we can just get them set up and start service even next week, but typically the beginning of the month is what we do. >> Then our HOAs have two service options there. So they can either have once or twice weekly trash collection. Most of them opt for the twice weekly trash collection. >> Sure. >> Yeah. 80%. >> So they're on three or fiveyear contracts usually and so we wait for the end of those contracts for us to be able to bid. >> Do you reach out to find out when the end of their contracts are and then you just have put them in a calendar basically >> Excel spreadsheet. >> Yeah. Okay. >> Yep. >> Yep. So once those are up for bid then we start to uh then we just calculate the price and everything and then we often the low bid will win. Unfortunately, that's kind of the name of the game. >> That's what I want to talk to you about. Yeah. >> So, we'll get Okay, let me ask one more question about the the slide before, which is who do you help? So, of homes in your area, do you know what percentage of them are scatter versus kind of like contained within HOAs and like kind of off the basically off the board until they come up? >> In my service area, the there's a very large majority that are HOAs. >> Okay. >> Yeah, >> that is Do you have any idea what percentage? I don't know, but I can just see it on a map. >> Just if you guesstimate it for me, it's fine. >> Um >> 70%. >> 70. Okay. Okay. Are there a lot of other competing trash services on the scatter side? >> There's one big one that's really causing us to reduce a lot of our prices right now. >> Yeah, we're going to we're going to we'll we'll deal with that. Okay. Got it. Okay. Let's keep going. So, give me the the money stuff. How do you make money? >> So, for our scatter customers, we charge $29.67 a month, which is built quarterly at $89. And as an intro offer, we offer three months free. That's not all in one go. That's just on the third uh excuse me, second, third, and fourth invoice. >> Yeah. >> And for our HOA customers, it varies pretty widely. It really depends on, you know, the home type, whether it's it's a town home or a single family home. Single family home with a lot of families are going to produce a lot more trash and then we have to pay that at the landfill. Um, and so it also varies depending on the number of units as well as the proximity to our current route. Um, and they're actually all on a monthly billing schedule, >> but but the scatter ones are on a monthly billing schedule, too, right? >> No, they're built quarterly. >> Oh, quarterly. Excuse me. Got it. Got it. Got it. Okay. Yeah. >> You price you price monthly. I got your >> Yeah, exactly. Y >> Okay, cool. Okay. So, how do you get customers? >> We have four different channels through which we get customers. So, we have door todoor and I currently go and do right around 300 a week. I knock out 300 doors and my close rate is right around 26%. And we hired a >> What's your door open rate? >> Door open rate was I don't have that ready, >> which is rough. >> I believe it was around 30%. >> Is it really? >> Yeah. >> Dude, so you knock on 12 doors, you get a sale. >> Yeah. >> So chill. >> Yeah. >> You can just like You're like, "Hey, I got to get lunch." You're like, "Give me two seconds." Just like knock on 12 doors and you buy lunch. >> I'm not the best sales guy, but yeah. I mean, I can even sell. So, >> okay. Yeah. Okay. There's There's some things that we're going to do in the offer that think's going to help us out, but Okay. So, doortodoor, $50 commission per sale. That's what you're paying your current sales guy? >> Yes, exactly. And he recently started with us 3 weeks ago. >> Got it. And he's How many deals is he doing a day? >> So, he's been getting better and better, but right now he averages right around five. >> Five a day. I mean, it's not a bad It's not a bad gig. And he'll just keep getting better, right? >> Yes. >> Like yesterday he got seven. >> That's awesome. Yeah. >> That's good. That's really good. That's very exciting. Okay. Now you pay him 50 and he's collecting less than 50. >> No, he'll he's a a contractor, so he just gets all the 50. >> No, no, as in for what? He like he's collecting less than 50, but you pay him 50 for getting the sale. >> He collects the 89 for the first invoice. >> Okay. For the first three quarter or for the first three months. >> Yep. Okay. You said that it was you said it was month 2 3 4 is where they're getting their free month >> the quarter 2 3 4. >> So they get one month on quarter two, quarter 3 and quarter four. Okay, got it. Understood. Okay, that's fine. Okay, so let's walk let's walk through the so I understand the DDD. Do you have percentage breakdowns on these between which one's what in terms of how many are coming from door to door? How many are coming from paid ads? How many are coming coming from outreach? How many coming from referrals? >> No, I don't have those numbers. >> Rough estimate. Yeah. I mean, recently I'd say 50% have been coming from door to door because I've really been pounding the pavement quite literally. >> Yeah. Yeah. And then we leave cards there and stuff and then people sign up. >> Yeah. I did see your door hanger got 1.2%. >> Yeah. >> Super interesting. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Okay. Let's Okay. Well, we we'll keep going. Okay. So, paid ads, you're spending 600 a month. >> Yep. Yeah. We have meta ads. We run 600 a month. That gets us HOA and scatter customers, but they're marketing. We're we're targeting scatter customers and we also do cold outreach. So cold email I exhaust that list pretty quickly. And then I also have started doing in the past uh 6 months uh handwritten letters to members. >> Yep. >> 100%. >> And then we also have referrals for our scatter customers and the for each referral they get one free month of service. >> So I'll just say this right now. If you have call it 500 HOAs which represent 70% of the market is not a cold email play. So that's where it's the handwritten card personal gift drive up. It's like you have 365 days. It's like go to two a day. You know what I mean? And obviously you're going to have the ones that are due, you know, with their own whatever the renewal is. And so even if they're on threeear cycles, 500 divided by three, so it's 15. you go to one every other day where you decide to do one day a week where you visit seven and it's like you are 100% up to date if you just did that. Yeah, I think there's some there's there's opportunity there. Okay. So, and then referrals. >> Yeah, referrals for our scatter customers when they refer their neighbor successfully, they get one free month of service. Okay. >> We also fasttrack them after they get 10 referrals and we just give them a for a year at that point. >> Cool. Does that get a lot of people? >> Not as many as I'd like. I I don't think I've been good enough about nurturing referrals, but >> I have I have ideas. So, how many do you help? What's your sales velocity per month? Okay. >> Yeah. So, we get total average leads is 217 per month. We close about 72 of them. >> That's good. >> Which is a 33% close rate. >> And is that when you see leads there, is that from Meta primarily? >> A lot of them are organic, so they'll see our cans and then >> Oh, [ __ ] >> Yeah. >> And do you have like QR codes and things on the cans? >> No, we don't. >> Interesting. >> That's interesting. Well, >> yeah, >> I'll write that down. >> Yeah, >> but yeah, they'll see our cans throughout their neighborhood and be like, "Everyone's switching to your service, so I might as well switch, too." >> Yeah. >> And they Yeah, that's They just call in. >> And so our average month for HOAs is usually two leads. >> And you provide the bins? >> We do. Yeah. >> Do you have a specific color or do they have to be a certain color? >> Yeah, I think it helps with our branding. >> No, so they do have to be a certain color. >> So they can provide their own if they want. >> Most people just want our bins. >> Okay. Okay. And so we provide we provide a trash and recycling container. >> All right. I have so many ideas. Average per month you get two HOA leads. You close half your HOA leads. That's great. >> And those are somewhat inbound. Or is that from the outbound efforts you're doing? >> Yeah, those we'll we'll start with the outbound and then we often times they'll reach a property manager. Yeah. Or community manager rather. And then they'll say, "Hey, not interested right now." And then they'll reach out later. >> Got it. Okay. Heard. So you've got a thousand scatter, 13 HOAs, 2500 doors. Okay, let me give me all the other numbers unless you think there's anything that's important here. HOA customers more likely to convert in spring and summer. Okay, >> just that our churn is super low. Um, but I think that that might change if we increase prices. Um, because we haven't been as aggressive for increasing recently. >> Yeah, I got you. >> Yeah. >> Okay. Yeah, cuz I do have I have a bunch of questions on gross margin, lifetime gross profit insurance. >> Yep. Yeah. So, our our revenue is 642,000 as I mentioned earlier, 151, gross margin 8%. Um, net margin -23. >> So, how's your The gross margin seems off. >> Yeah. >> So, how is that how is it 8%. Cuz it can't c like if you're charging $29 a month, it's not costing you $26 per month for each incremental ad. >> So, that was this past year. And this past year was rough with repairs. >> Yeah. The $100,000 repairs. >> Yeah. Just for one truck. Like, that's not even all the trucks. Like, it was pretty excessive. >> Brutal. >> Yeah. >> Okay. >> Yeah. So, blended CAC of $67 with a blended LTV of $1,300. >> And is LTV like like lifetime revenue or gross margin? >> Gross margin. >> Okay. Okay. That feels better. What's annual retention >> or monthly churn? Either way, >> uh it's at point4%. >> Nice. >> Nice. Sick. That's really good. Okay. So, and then you've got marketing at $1,000 a month. Is that you that includes doortodoor? >> Yes. Marketing with door to door. That's actually we since we just started that guy that's going to be increasing >> be way more obviously if he's closing seven that's three you know that's 350 right there. Okay. >> Exactly. >> What else you got? >> So our numbers by customer type. So 50/50 for our revenue. So 300,000 for our HOAs. And then um we have a CAC of $1,200 with an LTV of 23,000 and an LTV CAC of 18 to1. >> And our gross margins on this are 23%. And we have a total of 13 of these customers. And the reason the gross margins are off there compared to what was last year is because I'm going based on, you know, backing out some of those costs that we had >> that are oneoff one-off costs. And then for the scatter, we have 300,000 in revenue and a CAC of $51 and LTV of a,000. 21 to1 uh LTV to CAC and a gross margin of 26 to 40%. And the reason I did that range there is because right now it's at 26. But once we get efficiency, it's we're very easily going to get to 40. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. You can also raise prices a couple dollars. It's like, oh, look, we go 10%, we add three bucks. >> That's true. Yeah. >> Yeah. Okay. >> Yeah. >> Let me see the ads. So, we have a total ad spend of 7,500 with a cost per click of $212 and total clicks of 3500 with total sales of 153 and a CAC of 51 uh 63 with an LTV of a,000 just like the other ones and then LTV to CAC of 20 to1. >> What stops you from just spending 70,000? >> A lot of it is our our cost per lead goes like crazy crazy high because it's such a small area we're marketing towards. >> I'll tell you why, but okay. when I was doing it. I could be doing it wrong. Um, but it was just it was >> you're doing a lot of stuff right. >> I feel like I'm doing everything wrong. >> No, you're good. You're good. We'll get there. Okay. So, meds, I got this. These numbers are good, though. I get You're saying that it skyrockets after a certain point. We'll deal with that. Do you have any other metrics or creative to show? >> I have the cold outreach. It's kind of skewed a little bit because it's so low for our our cost per lead because it's all public data. Um, but this is for email as well as uh the direct mail. >> You're just not valuing your time because you're the one doing it. >> Yeah. Yeah. That's right. >> Okay. Yep. >> So, yeah. I mean, $12,000 if you have 700 to one. Yeah. Let's do more than that. Yeah. It only cost you $174 to make, you know, $12,000. >> Really? >> And you got nine more HOAs in the pipeline. >> We do. Yeah. I'm a lot of them seem very interested. >> If you close half, what happens to the business? >> The business grows substantially. Yeah. >> Okay. That sounds chill. >> That sounds pretty good. >> Okay. You know, so what's really interesting about your business is that we have two key decisions that we have to make. Decision number one is what avatar we're going to focus on. Decision two is what channel we're going to focus on to get them. I think the direction we go in will depend on you, but you might be surprised by which way we go. >> Okay. >> If you had to wave a magic wand, what thing is giving you the most heartburn right now? >> Not being able to >> obviously money. >> Yeah. >> But what's the what's the indicator prior to that? Like is it like if people paid you $200 upfront that would change the economics of the business dramatically? Like is it simply just not getting leads? Like I'm like that's I just want to understand that part. >> Yeah. It's more about offsetting some of the upfront costs. >> This is what I want to solve for which is I would like to have the most scalable acquisition channel we can that can get cuz also you you're like if you spend $7,000 even in a local area, you're not even getting close to tapping. How big's the the market overall? Like on a you know 10 20 mile radius? >> Yeah, it's pretty big. A few million people. >> Yeah. Right. I mean like you're not even close. So like I would love to see spend at like 7 $10,000 a month on the Facebook side and then probably another 5 or 10,000 a month on PBC which will have super high intent. I'll have different metrics around it but we'll get there. For us to solve the problem for good. We just need cash in the first 30 days to be greater than your cost of goods sold and CAC fully loaded, >> right? >> So, do you know what that number is? Like what's So, let's ignore CAC for a second. I guess we have 50. We can use that as a placeholder or 67. We want to be bullish or bearish. So, $67 CAC. And then what's it cost to kind of like onboard someone and kind of like get them going? >> I do that all myself. So I don't I mean >> if you paid someone and you and the bin was you had like fully fully bake it in cuz we want to scale past you, >> right? Yeah. So to deliver all the containers for you know let's say like 200 customers it' be about $500 to pay someone. >> So that's two $2 like50 >> per customer. >> Yep. >> So that's not big. So when I'm say so you get where I'm going with this where it's like okay if it cost us $70 if we made more than 70 on the first transaction which you do what's what's something like what's stopping is just that like you can't get more leads and then it just and then it because you're at 20 to1. >> Yeah. >> Right. And you're at least more than one to one on the front end. So like why like why not is it just you just can't as soon as you spend more just goes to zero like >> So yeah the issue is is that we have fulfillment those months after that we still have to cover. So like they pay for the quarter in the first month and then we have to pay for fulfillment in months two and three. >> Uhhuh. >> Which is completely it costs roughly like if we get them all >> give me that number >> that would be for the fully that's what I'm saying cost of goods. So give me the fully loaded before you get the next payment. >> Got it. Yes. Okay. So, um, for each customer on the existing round, it's $14 >> or per pickup per month, right? >> So, it's $14 and you're going to pick it up three times. >> We have three pickups per week. Yep. >> Wait, hold on. It's 14. It's 14 hours per month, right? >> Yes. >> Okay. 14 hours per month and they're paying quarterly. >> Yes. >> So, it's times three, right? So, it's 42 bucks in costs for the first month of delivery. When I say delivery, I mean like fulfillment, right? And your CAC is, we'll call it $70, >> right? >> So, if we get upfront cash over call it 120 bucks, you could be good to go, >> right? >> Well, then let's solve for that. >> Yeah. >> Okay. >> Pull it out of me. >> No, you're good. I mean, That's why we're here. Okay, cool. Let's come over. Let's Let's break it up. Let's figure it out. What order do I want to do this in? I think we need So, I think what we're going to do is I think we're going to go avatar. I want to get clear on this because I think that's super important. Two is I actually think we're going to go offer next. We have to figure out like how we're going to, you know, do it, >> uh, you know, facilitate the transaction. And then once we know that, then we can do acquisition channel. And then I think we can go ads and then we're going to go sales process. We'll do some funnel funnelytics. I think that's it. I think that's what we need to do. Okay. >> You're at that in that stage where like I like having one avatar, one channel, one product up to a million dollars or more, right? And you're kind of you're right there, right? And so you have two avatars and like five channels >> pretty much, >> right? Yeah. And so you feel spread thin. This is me just hearing you out. And so what I want to solve for is we have to make this decision between HOA and scatter. So if you could just do one, which one would you do? >> I think HOA is a better opportunity. >> Okay. I'll tell you I'll tell you why I don't like either of them. >> Okay. and then I'll tell you why I like both. Okay? All right. >> So, the reason that I don't like HOA is I never want to have a commoditized service where I get into an auction >> because then it's always just going to be raced to the bottom. Now, >> the reality is that that's not going to change. And so, it's like what business are you really in, right? And so, the business that I think you're really in is the efficiency business. So fundamentally like if you if if 70% of the market is owned by HOAs and they continue to gobble more and more you know more of these houses continue to glob together then it's kind of an in uh eventuality right that happens. So figuring out the HOA offer I think makes sense from a future proofing perspective, but the strategy of the business has to be geared towards efficiency because it's the only way you're going to beat the other players because I agree. I think they're going to commoditize you and I think they're going to make it lowest lowest bid fundamentally. The reason that I like scatter in the short term is that you can price more aggressively. You can higher gross margins. You can outmarket, you know, your competition. There's still a decent amount of market share that's there, but and acquiring them is super easy. If you just knock on 12 doors and get a sale, it's like, all right, well, how many doors do you need to knock on? >> That's true. >> It's like very straightforward. >> Because like taking it to the hypothetical extreme, it's like, okay, >> what stops me from running an ad, getting 10 guys, getting them into a room, taking a day to have them, you know, to train to train them, and then all of a sudden I've got 10 guys doing five or five to seven sales a day, all on contract with no risk. >> That sounds relatively appealing. And the nice thing with doortodoor is that they already naturally have a route, right, which you already know. And so it it makes it even more efficient for the business right on the back end. So that's what I like about scatter, but I do think that there's, you know, long long term there's there's probably some downside risk or sorry. Yeah, there's some risk. The HOA I just feel like you're going to continue to get squeezed. >> Yeah, that's the only So you're like, okay, well then which one should I do? You mind if I add something? >> Yeah, go for it. >> I think that the thing with scatter that's even better, too. And the reason I said HOA was not really because of >> Oh, you're good. >> Like the I like I like HOAs because I think that the competitor that we have right now that's really aggressive is really going hard scatter and no HOAs. So like it and then a competitor that only does HOAs, we recently acquired so people are unhappy with them. So then it kind of opens it up for me. But the thing I love about scatter is what you said about pricing and then also the fact that it's only once weekly collection. So we increase throughput for each truck. >> Mhm. >> So that's the thing I like about it. But in terms of you know me being one I guess I'm just thinking about it in a limited sense where I'm I'm like I'm only one guy. How many doors can I knock on a day? You know >> it's not going to be human. >> Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So we just I mean let's think of it this way. You said when you get to 3,000 doors is when you're like super profitable, right? like it becomes more profitable. >> Yeah, we have. >> And if we get to $5,000, then you're like, >> we're good. >> You're Yeah, you're good. >> Well, I mean, in my mind, I like to think like if I had to take this to its natural extreme, and I only had have one thing be true, cuz I like I like to make a plan on like the fewest need to believe is possible. Like every single new assumption that we introduce like dramatically decreases the likelihood that it occurs. If I said, "All right, do you think it's humanly possible to get 10 people to work on commission to knock these doors and get to let's say conservatively five a day right now? This guy's going to keep getting better. He's three weeks and he's already doing seven. Fine." But like, let's just say they stick to five a day. >> Y >> that's 50 sales a day. It's 1,500 a month. You're looking at $20,000 by the end of the year. >> That's >> right. And so to me it's like okay well that overshoots our goal by like you know 8x. >> So there's all these things that you're doing but if it was like if only that one thing were true then what are the other need to believe that are associated with that which is that you can find the houses to do these door knocking on. >> Do you have the ability to do that? >> Yeah. >> Okay. So knowing where to go is not a problem. >> Yeah. >> And so basically your ability to solve two things. one is the cash to pay the salespeople that they collect as much as you owe them and that you can cover the cost of the first, you know, the $42 that we went over earlier. And so, like, if the only thing you did was like you went home and you were like, I'm going to go find 10 dudes and they will be commission only and I will just rejig the offer so that I can get $42 plus what I have to pay them upfront. We don't have to talk about anything else. >> Yeah. Let's do it. I mean, like I can go through like I can look at the ads and I can tell you what I think like could be better. I can tell you why the the which you know, we can go through some of those things, but fundamentally like I just want to be like here's the ramrod. Like if only this were true, then what stops me from doing that? Not a ton, which is just the offer and getting the sales guys on. >> Yeah. >> And then after that's done, it's like that's it. >> Yeah. And then we just and then we just jam it and then you just don't let yourself get distracted, >> right? >> I will give you my my blessing on if you get an inbound HOA, you can close them. >> But I still would be like this is our growth strategy. I mean, like, yeah, sure, except for money provided it doesn't there's it's super operationally efficient. It does take some of your time. Fine. You're the owner. You can close big deals. But by and large, I think that's the play. >> Okay. All right. Great. So, I think we go scatter. [Music] Great. That was decision number one. >> Yep. >> Now, acquisition channel, you already have 50% coming from door to door. So, that gives us that one. Right. So, I'm going to hit the sales process in a second, but I think we need to go on offer because this is kind of the big the big unlock of this business. All right. So, we have to get You said you're going to pay them 50, right? >> Yes. >> Okay. So, here's how I would restructure this. I would say we have to get $42 no matter what. Period. Because that's what it costs. That's hard cost, right? So, this is base. Then got to get the sales guy paid. So, I'm just going to put commission here, which we can fill in in a second. So, we kind of backfill that. Okay. We have to get a commission and we have to get the contract, right? So, what I want to do is find something. So, do you give them all a new bin or can they get like a do they get like somebody else's bin or like how does that work? >> We recycle the bin. So if someone like the three people who canled then we'll but for the most part they're new bands. >> They're new bands. Yeah. >> Okay. >> And we'll finance them over 3 years. Before I bought them with cash, but then I'm like, "Okay, maybe we should probably move on to more cash." >> You wait, you used to pay for them in cash. You finance them. >> Now I'm financing. Yeah. >> And do the customer is that $14 per month including included? >> Yes. Yes. >> How much does it cost for a bit >> for the set including freight? It's 116. All right. So, it's 116. Okay. Now, so this is Ben. What else can you sell up front? Bulk pickup maybe. >> Um, >> but the only How many What percentage customers like opt for that? >> That's also seasonal and that's >> So, no, that's not the offer. Okay. What else? So, I'll tell you I had this idea. So, we talked about the QR code earlier. Mhm. >> So, what I was thinking about doing was like you put the just the ugliest massive QR code on there and you just say, "Hey, if you want to not have this big QR code on there, it's it's an extra five bucks a month." >> Or if you're cool with it and you're still like cool with us advertising the business, you allow us to leave it on. >> Okay. And I think a lot of people don't give a [ __ ] >> Yeah. >> Right. And so all we're going to do though is just tack that on to your existing pricing. So you're So if the standard price right now is $29, I just want to go to $34, which is what I think you should be charging anyways. >> And so you're going to pay the same amount anyways, but it's just we're going to make it feel like oh I get to choose. You know what I mean? And so we're going to give them a pain of choice, which is do I want this ugly QR code to advertise trash on my thing every week or do I not want it? And they may be like, "You know what? I'll just pay the five bucks." Or they might be like, "I don't give a [ __ ]." And you're like cool. And then we just got like the the most valuable real estate of local marketing for your business. I love that. Yeah. >> I mean like if you've got like think about how many cans you're going to have on your routes. All of them have massive QR codes. And it's like that's just free advertising for you. >> Right. And they're like It's like that's actually a really clever idea. >> I mean >> thanks. >> I like it a lot. >> Hey, you can have it. I >> can't execute on it. But no it makes perfect sense. I >> have other use cases for it. Okay. So, that gives you $161 on the first statement. Okay. So, that's more than $120. So, now you just need to make 40. You got me? >> Mhm. Yes. >> And so then what I would actually do instead of having these weird bills, I'm just going to do subscriptions. >> Okay. And the way we're going to do it is I would probably do an acquisition offer and a core offer. So, the acquisition offer is the the thing that we get in and then once they're in, they're just on the regular price. And so I'd probably do the three months at $29 with the QR code or $34 without. And then after that, it goes into one month at $49 with the QR code, $54 without. >> Okay. >> And so that way, you get way more money after and there's two massive value reasons for this, which is one is that if you're now we're already covering the hard cost, we're already covering the commission and we have an extra $40, which means I can I can juice this offer even more, which I'll tell you in a second. But the second thing is that we're going to have these higher prices on the backend, which is going to allow us to make way more than the $1,000 that we've been living off of. It's because someone who runs with you now for the next 10 years instead of making, you know, your your current LTV, your LTV is going to be substantially higher. And so that gives you so much more wiggle room to acquire them. You got me? And so the name of the game is just increase your acquisition ability because if you're already at 20 to one, can you just double the amount you spend on acquisition? Yes. And so I would normally we talked about like we're going to do doortodoor. I'm going to just spend all of that 40 on the offer. Yeah. >> Totally. And so what I would do is if it's three months at 29 or $34 without what I would say is I would just say, "Listen, get started for $1." And then I'd say and the first three months are $29 or $34 without. And I'd say and this is assuming that you can get the bins to them quickly, but I'd say and your first two months of bins are included. So you can just include them in that QR code offer. >> Nice. Yeah. I'd say and I would love to do like something like the first week and the bins like the first week would be so aggressive and so good that it would be it would be insane because then you'd have like crazy buzz because it'd be like, dude, people like people would actually talk about trash collection. Can you imagine that? Like they'd be like, you won't believe this deal I just got on my trash. Like trash collection? Yeah, dude, [ __ ]. It's actually amazing. And I'm like I just want you to be that business. >> Right. >> Cuz like it's just like so aggressive that it's like a no brainer. So now the entire first week, I would have every single person who's in your target zone like getting like hit across these you know whether they like going to get flyers on their car doorknockers all these things and by the way if they see your cans with massive QR codes you're like hey click that to get this insane offer for you know for the first week I would like go crazy aggressive on the in the offer and also on the amount of acquisition I would do during that week. And so, that'd be one one idea. What I'd also do on top of that, and you said on the referrals, you only get one month free now, I'd probably do I'd probably make it bigger. Like I'd say the first month at $39 or whatever. And then I'd say you know if you refer three people then you get a year for free at the discounted price. And that would be so aggressive that more people would want to do it. And you also I don't know what your comms are to these people. Like do you nurture them at all? Like have you ever thought about this in terms of like you're just waiting to >> I mean I just do ads targeting them. >> Yeah, but But do you communicate? But you don't communicate to them. Right? >> No, I have a newsletter >> is going. >> Okay, do you? And do people open it? >> Yeah, they open it. >> Okay. And is it just one newsletter to everybody? Like there's no segmentation? >> Yeah, no segmentation. >> Okay. So, if I were you, I'd have different messages for HOAs and scatter. And I would do more for scatter because scatter is actually going to grow your business. And in scatter, I would have different things that basically like every month like every two weeks or whatever, I'd be like have you referred somebody? Because if you do, you know, this is the benefit that you get from it. And you'd communicate what the benefit is. You could even say like say you had like a top 10 list, you know what I mean? You're like the top 10 people who have referred people this year and you just like have the names and then you actually physically print this and give this to them and deliver it. And you'd be like, dude, that guy's got 92. Like what? And by the way, those guys are just paying nothing for their trash, but they make you $92,000. And to me, that seems like a pretty fair trade. >> Yeah, totally. >> You get what I'm saying? And so you just have to like make the the referral thing like big. Like you have to make it a big thing and then you have to just keep reminding them that it is a big thing. The one the one thing that I would say on that, which is a little bit of a sidebar is that and I don't know if you do this already, but the bins themselves like if it were me the bins would have to be the most insane bins anyone ever seen. Like I would want everyone talking about how crazy my trash bins are. Like I'd make them the nicest sharpest like shiniest they'd be the ones that last the longest if they broke like you'd be on it like immediately you'd be like it broke I got you like I'll be there today we'll swap it out like I would just make the actual delivery of the service exceptional so that when people do talk about it and by the way if you have the lowest prices in the market or among the lowest which I don't think you should by the way we should we should we should we shouldn't be the lowest but if we're lower then combine lower price with crazy exceptional service like people would want to talk about that. >> Yeah. >> And so I think it's just like right now you're just not being talked about a lot and I think the way that you make people talk about you is you do kind of crazy things. And the only problem is that you're like I'm in trash collection like yeah but so is everyone else like you can still be crazy about it. You can still have people be like yo have you seen have you seen his bins? Like they're sick. You know what I mean? Like like just like there's something that you can do that that makes you feel special. >> Yeah. Okay, cool. And I would totally wear that on like the customer journey for existing ones, too, because you've already got they're already on your routes. >> Yeah. >> So, you could also be like I don't like and I don't know maybe this is maybe this is a terrible idea, but you could even be like yo we got these new bins. Like you could trade your old one or like if your old one is is like trashed we've got a fresh ones like come out and we'll swap it for you. And then you can still give them the QR code and be like you can keep the nice price or you can you know you can keep the QR code and keep the price that you have or you can pay you know $1 more per month and take it off >> you know what I mean >> and then you just get all these new bins in circulation with the QR codes on them if you wanted to and >> got it. >> and by the way, the QR codes could just be like an intake form that's like hey like did you want to sign up for you know Garvey trash collection whatever it is like and then it just takes them to like a sales page and that sales page could be different depending on the time of the year, right? You could have it go to the page that's like this week is insane week, you know what I mean? Or there could be like no it's just it's our standard offer just opt in. And so I think there's some flexibility there. Okay, so that's your whole thing. And so we've already identified scatter, we've already identified door to door, and we've already identified this offer restructure. >> Mhm. >> What I would probably do and I don't know what your current ads are, but do you have them? >> Yep. Let me pull them up. >> Okay, show me. >> All right. So, the main one for our scatter customers. >> Can you read what it says for me? >> Okay. >> Here we go. Tired of missing trash day? With Garvey Disposal, you never have to worry again. We provide reliable trash, recycling, and yard waste pickups for homeowners. Quality service, fair pricing, and a commitment to keeping your neighborhood clean. Switch today. >> Okay. And then how do they where do they switch? Where do they go? >> They click on it. It takes them to a landing page. Our landing page has a bunch of social proof. There's a form. They fill out their information, their address and everything, and then they submit >> and then and then that goes to you or >> I get a I get an email and then I give them a call back. >> Well, we should have somebody do that for you. >> Yeah, I need to hire somebody for that. >> 100. I mean like immediately you should do that like today like I mean it like not I'm saying that is sincerely like >> yeah >> before you leave here like before you even I want to like put a pin on that like right now which is we need to get somebody to do the inbound call downs and also the follow-up like the like why aren't you signing up like the the thing that's like text and email to just like keep pinging until they say no. >> Yeah, totally. Yeah, no, I definitely can do that. >> Yeah, like I would immediately do that today like I mean it. Okay, and so okay so the copy by the way wasn't bad. I thought it was actually decent. The three things that I would I would change on the ad like I'm assuming this would be like a visual ad it's not it's not like it's not just copy >> there's a picture >> okay and what is the picture >> it's of a neighborhood with bins out front. >> Okay. It's like a it's like a pretty home or >> yeah it's a nice home yeah >> okay I would put like a really janky trash can like being like blown over. Like I would have the image be a problem >> like a mess. >> Like like I would make it be like have you ever like experienced this like you know what I mean like let me show you what it feels like or like have you ever like I would I would just exaggerate like I want to agitate them like crazy like look at all the trash that's on the side of the road like look at like like you know what I mean just like yeah all the trash. And then the second line I would change which is tired of missing trash day is like missed trash day again question mark. Like I would just want them to like I just I want them to feel it even more and then I might also do something which I've seen be super effective which is like a scratch and a dent offer I would say like you know trash collection at you know 70 off for the next six months and it's like but only for the next 43 people. And so it becomes this thing where we're giving them a new reason to buy right now. Because you're not giving them any scarcity urgency nothing nothing's triggering them to buy. Like I would want to give them something. And so in that first week when we go crazy aggressive I would say like 70 off for the first 300 people who sign up and it's like dude you'd have everybody signing up and once they sign up like they stay. >> Right. And so I just give them a crazy good deal for 3 months and then they're gonna stay because they have point4 percent churn, right? So they're going to stay. And I'm not like I'm not overly worried about them leaving because the LTV is so strong and I can crank on the back end. That makes sense? And I would probably have that QR code be a little bit less. I'd have more of the trash can. >> Yep. >> Like have it be way bigger. Like you kind of have to squint to see it. Like I would make the trash can huge. I'd make that that copy huge. And I would also put a QR code >> like instead of just like I'd put a QR code like as like another thing that they could scan if they wanted to. >> Okay. >> Like I would just I would just juice this thing and I would make it look like, you know what, I would make it look messy. Like messy design is not bad. Like you can like messy like because it's supposed to call people's attention on things. You know what I mean? The other thing that I would make is I would do like you know how when you go into websites sometimes they have like a little offer box that like slides down like get 20% off. I do that on my website too. And so when people click QR codes or when people click the ad or when people go to anything, they go to your site. I want to make sure that there is something that is either prompting them to say what happens if you add it or, you know, 20% off, 50% off, you know, whatever it is because that is going to just increase the the number of people who convert. Does that make sense? And so at least you can like capture like dude, the hardest thing is getting somebody to a page. And so once they go there, I just want to make sure that we can juice everything that we can in order to get them to convert. Does that make sense? And then I would also probably test not having a form field and just like having a phone number, like a dedicated number >> on the on the site rather. >> Instead of filling out a form, they have to >> or or they can or or or have a phone number and also have a form field. >> Gotcha. Yeah. And my form >> they're not mutually exclusive. >> Yeah, it's super simple. It's like the bare minimum just like name, email, >> love it. Love that. I'd have them I'd have them like first name, last name email, phone number, and address like immediately I want the address. I just I want to know like, can I serve you? So I need to know your address like right away. >> Yeah, totally. >> And then if and then we already have these like workflows built out so we can like throw them into workflows Yeah. to automatically like add them into our scheduling system and everything. >> Cool. I mean, you can do that. Like, I I just think like immediately you need to call. >> Yeah. I think >> so. Okay, so I showed you. I mean like I can go through more ads, but I think you already got the big one which is like juice it make it more problem aware, have a clear reason to buy today. Those are your big takeaways. >> And also like use the QR code and make the actual bins look I make him look dope and just make the delivery experience dope too. And I think the other thing is like you said like the referral thing if you could just like turn that into an absolute machine it's crazy. Like I think you'd be surprised. I think it's underestimated how much people are willing to do if you just keep prompting them. And so right now they don't even know that it's a possibility. I would remind them every month. I would probably do yeah, probably two weeks like every two weeks I would send them an email and I would have that list be like the most active email address I have. You know, I'd be like hey I just want to remind you like don't forget if you refer, you know, your your two neighbors, you get your trash for free for the next year, and then when they do, you can just like put them on this on a cadence where they get reminded like hey don't forget like six more months left of your free year like you only need to refer to people, you know, to to get another year, whatever it is. You just got to create like a really like fun game that people want to play. And I think you'd be surprised how much they'll they'll play it. >> And dude and by the way like every time you send that message, just have like a table of the people who have the most. And like that'll create some competition. >> Yeah, that's fun. >> And we're competing over who can refer the most trash collection. Like insanity. But like people do it. Like people like people like to compete. >> Yeah, no, it's fun. >> And like you have this unique unfair advantage which is that all of your customers are clumped together >> Right. >> which I mean it's obviously like that but like you know what I'm saying? Like it's so much easier to just like refer like it's not like they're all spread out across the globe. Like they can literally see like your neighbor referred you like you should refer the next guy. Like that's awesome. >> You're exactly right. That's why social media works too because everyone's just influencing each other so much. >> Yeah, that's that that's amazing. Okay, so we went avatar scatter, acquisition channel door to door, offer, I think we solved. I think we should probably spend a little bit of time on sales process. All right. So, salespeople. So, the first thing is how do you want to acquire the salespeople? >> So, I was going to use you know the job board like Indeed. >> Okay. >> And I would probably also run Facebook ads as well just because I want to maximize my market there. >> You put up how much in the first month or like what what do you think you want to put towards recruiting? >> Maybe like I'd probably start with a couple hundred dollars. >> I'd do more like immediately. If you're going to make this play, I would go to, you know, $1,000, $2,000. I want 10 10 salespeople like this week. I mean, like and just try them out. There's really no downside if they're commission only, you know what I'm saying? And so just like get as many guys as you can. And I just want to like just see how many of them can be good. You know what I'm saying? So like I'd make the upfront investment in just recruiting them. I mean like you're you're not paying them till they collect so it's really just a question of like can you do the training. And the training isn't that extensive. It's like I'll show you in a second. But like I want to get them going like now. >> Yeah, no, I really like that. >> And like you're you're I I think like if you could >> get like there are some months that you've told me that you're like, oh, we don't have enough to pay the sales guy in the first month cuz like the you know, you got to pay them 50. I really just want to focus on getting the offer dialed and then jamming. And if you need like a bridge, like talk to your bank or figure out like some sort of like, you know, you need some capital like to do this with but like because I think like by the time you get to like end of Q1 beginning Q2, you should have like a real functioning like very profitable business. Like I don't I don't see like if we just execute what we've talked about, I just see this going. And if you have like some sort of crazy repair that, you know, maybe then you just need like some buffer capital just to make sure that you can pay salespeople, but I just want to get them going. Like if you had 10 guys all each doing five a day for the next 90 days, like that would just be >> that would be nuts. I mean, that would that would do it. Yeah. >> I mean like it's over. Like your business is already like you're profitable. You're at like like probably like you'd be at like 25, 30% net profit, which would be sick. And then you could also make the decision to hire a guy who calls down people who fill out the form, >> right? Like and then just >> like put him on 25 an hour, >> you know what I mean? Or salary. Yeah. Like put >> them on a salary or something like that. Okay. So, this is what I would have as like the the door to door process. So, I would have your guy basically go to the door. I'd probably knock do like knock knock knock like three knocks not like just not one, but like three, and I'd stand slightly to the side. So like standing to the left or the right, wherever the window is, so they can see me. And then I'd be 12 inches back from the door so I'm not like super aggressive. And then I'll just like stand. And as soon as they open the door, I'm gonna smile immediately. And I probably introduce myself. So, I'd say, hey, my name's Alex. I'm with Garvey Trash Collection. We're in your neighborhood right now offering an insane promotion this month. And I wanted to see if you wanted to hear about it. >> And so if they say yes, you just go into the promo. >> Yep. >> And if they say no? >> So, if they say no, I'd be like, okay, well, you know, do you mind if I just ask you like how satisfied are you with your current trash collector and like I'd just like just throw something like a general question out because what they're probably saying no to is they don't want to spend time. >> Right. >> And so if they're saying no, I'd want to like keep the conversation going a little bit. So, I'd just ask them like an open ended question that shows that like I care about them. So that the the thing that I would want to know from all your salespeople is whether they're currently on a trash collection or not. >> Right. >> Because if they're not, it's a really easy decision. If they are, then I'd say like, okay, you're currently with blank. Like, can you tell me like what do you like about them? What do you don't like about them? You know what I mean? And just ask them some questions to understand like what they do and don't like. And then you're basically making that transition of like, well, I'm hearing what you don't like. That sounds a lot like we can actually solve that. Would you want to just hear about it and see if this is interesting? And then I'd go into the promo, And so you can like maneuver in. >> If they say like yeah yeah tell me what the promo is. And then I'd be like, okay, well, first of all, like I just want to understand like are you currently with somebody? Because like there's there's two different things that I can tell you. If you're not with anybody, like I got this insane offer, but if you're already with somebody, then like I can give you the promo and I could also help you navigate like how do you get off contract or like whatever you need. You know what I mean? And so I'd I'd do like a little like fact finding like I'd ask like what like how do you collect your trash? Right? And if they say like I'm with blank, then I'd say like, what do you like about them? What do you not like about them? Do you know what your contract is off? You know what I mean? Like like I would just like establish relationship first. And then I'd say like, well if you're if you're done then or like if you're if you're ready, like here's here's what we're doing. It's a get started for $1 campaign. It's only for the next, you know, 250 people. And we already have, you know, 50 people who've signed up in this neighborhood already. And you know it's basically you start for $1 and then you know it's only you know $29 a month with you know we have a big ugly QR code on it but a lot of people don't don't care about that or it's $34 with having a QR code like I would I would lay it out and I'd just be like totally up front. I'd be like honestly we're just trying to get like massive adoption in this area like it's an insane deal. Like I would just tell them the truth. And then I'd say and you know you're going to get the first three months at that price and then after that it goes to normal price which would be $49 with a QR code or $54 without and then the first two months of bins are included. So, you get the bins and then that's the deal. And if you sign up today, I can start you like I can actually get you started even like this week or next week if you want. And so like you just want to give them like urgency to sign up. If they can't if they say like I can't sign up I'd say okay what what's stopping you? And they'll like bring up an objection and you just answer the objection. And then you say so does that clear like does that clear everything up? Is there anything else that's like kind of blocking you? And they'll say like yeah well I'm still concerned about this and then you just answer that objection and then you say okay so like where does that leave us? And they'd say like I need to talk to my wife or I need to talk to my husband. And you'd say like okay well like that's fine like let's like let's walk through what the value is like you're getting three months at $29 or $34 a month depending on what you want to do with your bins. You're getting you know bins included on the front end. You get start like it only it doesn't cost you anything like for the first three months and they're like oh I get it. And then like like if I if and they're like well what if I want to cancel? You're like well you can cancel any time. Like it's month to month. And so I would just like keep walking people through and showing them like the value of the offer. And like your retention is so good. So all you're really doing is you're just getting them in and then they're going to stay for forever. Does that make sense? >> Mhm. >> And I would also probably have like if they can't if they still are like like saying like I got to talk to like maybe a spouse, I'd be like okay well let me just leave you with this card. Like I'll leave you my card. And like you know call me if you have any questions. And like then I'll also just leave you with like this basically like a version of the flyer so they have the information. And then I'd say like when would be a good time for me to follow up? And if they say like maybe next week I'd be like okay what day? Like like I want to put a pin on it. Like I actually want to come back. Like I'd be like I'll swing by like I'm going to be in the neighborhood again like next Thursday does that work? And they'll say yes or no and then I'll like literally mark it down. So like I have a list of when I'm supposed to come back. And then like Thursday I just come back and be like hey just wanted to check in like did you have a chance to think about it? And if they're like yeah I talked to my spouse and you know what we want to do it I'd be like great let's get you signed up. If they say no, then you just ask them a question. You're like what what changed? Like what what's what's the concern? And you just like address that concern. And you just keep going. >> And so that's the whole process. Do you have any questions? >> No, I think that's pretty pretty straightforward. >> Okay, I think let's redo the offer. I think we restructure it. I'd say instead of $29, we go to $34 flat. And so when they first sign up, they're signing up for $34 with the option to have a huge ugly QR code on their bins which brings it down to $29. So what that means is that you're going to get $102 on the first payment. We're taking $42 off for the for the hard costs. You're taking call it $50 off for commission. That gives you 10 bucks left over. And that 10 bucks you just keep to pay for anything that comes up or like whatever. But at least you're like you're even. And then on the back end, you move them up to $54 without the QR code or $49 with. And so what that does is that means that your monthly now you're making like an extra like 700 bucks a month per customer. Does that make sense? And so and that also makes your LTV go way higher. And so now all of a sudden like every single customer is way more valuable to you. Like instead of having you know an LTV of a,000 and change now it's probably going to be like closer to like two or 2500 or something like that. You know what I mean? It'll be higher. And so that gives you more flexibility to acquire them. And so I don't know if I should be spending more on ads. But to your point, you were saying like the cost per lead was going up when you started scaling. So, can you tell me a little bit more about that? >> Yeah, it just it seems like I exhaust the market pretty quickly and then cost per lead just goes through the roof. >> Okay. How much have you spent? Like what does it look like when you get to that point? >> 600 a month. >> Okay. So, you haven't been able to spend more than 600? >> I spent I spent last year. I spent I think like 15 to 20,000. Okay. And the return on ad spend was horrible. Like I was getting leads at like $100 plus a lead. >> Do you remember what you were saying in that in those ads? Like what was what was the offer? >> I think I was. >> I'm guessing it was. >> Probably like switch to us for, you know, reliable trash collection. >> Yeah. So, I think what you're going to see from this offer restructure is that the urgency the reason to buy today is going to substantially increase your your conversion rate. And so your the amount that you're willing to pay per lead should go up. Because right now, like if you're paying $100 a lead and you're converting at 30 33%, you're basically paying 300 bucks a customer. >> Right. But if you change the offer and you get people actually wanting to click and sign up because there's a reason to buy today, I think you're going to see that conversion rate go up. And I think you're also going to see the cost per lead come down because the the offer is more click worthy. Does that make sense? And so what I'd probably test is I'd probably say like, you know, I want to I'm going to try to spend, you know, let's say like $2,000 in the month of January. And let's just see what happens. I would split test that between like the new offer versus the old offer. And let's just let's just see like if we can if we can get the unit economics to work. Because if we can, then all of a sudden like you have a totally scalable channel. Because right now you're like I can only spend 600. But like if you could spend 5 or 10,000 a month on Facebook and it works like dude your your business would just skyrocket. You know what I'm saying? So I just want to test it and make sure that that that is a viable channel because I think it could be. >> Yeah. >> And even if it's not as good as doortodoor, like maybe it's still like profitable. You know what I'm saying? And then you could have like your main thing is door to door and then you have Facebook as a supplementary thing. >> Yeah. Makes sense. >> Okay. I also want to make sure we talk about like PPC real quick because I think like the person who's Googling like trash collection near me like that intent is so insanely high. Like it's crazy high. So I want to make sure that you're you are investing in that and that you're showing up. Have you done that? >> I haven't done that. >> Okay. I would I would do that immediately. Like I that's something else I'd start like today. Like truly. And I'd probably put you know another grand or $2,000 behind that at the beginning just to like see like what the unit economics look like. But I my guess is it's going to be really strong because people like like the people
