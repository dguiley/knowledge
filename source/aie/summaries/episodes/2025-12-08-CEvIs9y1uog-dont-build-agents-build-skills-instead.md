# Don't Build Agents, Build Skills Instead

This episode features a discussion on shifting the focus from creating entire AI agents to developing modular skills that enhance an agent's capabilities, emphasizing proficiency and customization.

## Core Thesis
The episode argues for a paradigm shift in AI development, suggesting that instead of building complete agents from scratch, efforts should be directed towards creating specific skills. This approach leverages domain expertise and modularity, allowing agents to be customized and scaled more effectively.

## Key Insights
- There's a critical gap in agent expertise; emphasizing skill development fills this gap by integrating domain knowledge.
- Code serves as a universal interface enabling scalability and adaptability.
- The evolution of AI skills mirrors software development, focusing on testing, integration, and continuous learning.
- Collaborative ecosystems and partnerships enhance skill functionalities across various domains.
- Non-technical users are increasingly contributing to skill development, making AI more accessible.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Develop skills that align with organizational workflows, enhancing internal processes.
2. Encourage non-technical team members to contribute to the skill development process for greater adoption and utility.
3. Utilize progressive disclosure and versioning to manage and track the evolution of agent skills.

## Notable Quotes
> "We think code is all we need."

> "Anyone can create [skills] and they give agents the new capabilities that they didn't have before."

> "Skills are just the starting point."

> "It's time to stop rebuilding agents and start building skills instead."
