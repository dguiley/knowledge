# AI system finds winning ads scale

Published: 2025-02-08

what if you could test a thousand different ad messages in just one hour at a very small budget and find exactly what makes your customer buy you know your product is good your offer is solid but every time you run ads the results are never what you hope for well think about it it doesn't matter how good your product is at least when it comes to advertising when it comes to advertising what matters is hear me out the words you use to help your prospect to convince themsel that your product is the solution to their problem and to find these specific words sentences emotions stories you need a solid system and that's what I'm about to show you in this video you know before we even think of scaling any other account for our clients there is one system we always use first it's n negotiable why because without it everything you do is irrelevant you are basically guessing and believe me in advertising guessing it's not a thing we want data to move forward so in this video I'm not just going to show you the system we use I'm also going to show you how we've turned it into an AI automation system I'm not talking about an agent here I'm talking about a system that uses a simple spreadsheet as the base that requires human interaction and triggers several AI automations to go through each step deep market research hook generation static ads creation and finally importing them in your ad account and the really cool part is that you or your team can do everything it's not rocket science so if you don't have time right now save this video for later or if you're up for it grab a coffee make make yourself comfortable and let's dive in all right so let's first talk about the whole picture the what do we do each step I I'm going to give you a an overview and then we will dig a little bit deeper into the message testing what it is exactly what does it how does it work and then we will look at uh every scenario separately um to give you an idea of the kind of things you can you can bu um for your teams for your team sorry so the first thing you need when you want to make good ads is market research that's not a secret right um and I'm talking quite a lot about I've talked a lot about market research on my channel um so that won't be the scope of this video I'm I'm currently working on a process to kind of automate it but to be honest with the the last advancement of um chat GPT de process research that just came out by the time I'm recording this video I'm even wondering if it's necessary I haven't tested yet for market research but I will in the future and probably make a video about it um but right now uh if you I don't know how deep research is working for chpt but what shows that if you go on my channel and you look for this video market research is easy actually you will find this amazing system I'm really proud of it I have created uh which allows you to um use certain Google queries to quickly find out all the pages in uh forums Kora Reddit um different social media YouTube um Twitter LinkedIn different communities uh even Amazon all the the pages that are ranking on YouTube on Google sorry that talks about your prospect problem you just have to Define your prospect program right then you put them into notebook LM and you can process them to extract gold nuggets customer wording and so on and so forth so once you have that if you go and watch this video you will have all the step and you end up with a complete description of your brand the values the the customer you have a Persona you have like a lot of wording that you can use now for your ads so you need that to start the system okay so that's the the market research is a prerequisite if you want to start using the system now before I um showing you the system I think it's it's better in fact to just look at what is message testing because then everything I'm going to talk about will be a lot more clear so what we want is to find out the words that people react with that your prospect react react with and and for that we use very simple image images ads with just a hook or a statement a true or false question or a small headline or a piece of a story we have those different categories that we use and we voluntarily make it very simple um for the the design because we don't want we only want to test the message and we never test different colors or we just test the same color same format with different messages so we isolate every other we push every other variables and we isolate the one we want to test which is the words that we are going to use so imagine having like thousands of ads like this running uh in your ad account and it looks something like that right it's a so you would have you have a testing campaign in your ad account that is dedicated to that and in your testing campaign then you will have different phases so you start you have only assumption and you start generating hooks as I'm going to show you here and you create one ad per um image you don't have an ad copy you only have the image and the headline and the call to action on Facebook and you start with phase one and you make them run you set up a rule so at after 4 500 impression they stop running this way every single ad that you are testing has the same amount of impression it's not always exact but at least it is similar you test on 500 impression and you look at the result which one per form P important Point here we are running traffic ads why it's because this is the fastest way to acquire traffic that is not costing you a fortune and that's why in the end if you want to have four five 600 impression per ad it will cost you depending on your Market but between three and5 basically so now that you know what is uh basically the message testing it's a campaign where we test hundreds or if not thousands of messages on static ads and now the system that I'm about to show you looks like that from if you zoom out right we have plenty of different hooks that generate ads that we Import in the ad account okay so now let's zoom in on the system the first thing we want to do here is to generate not to generate is to uh Define the variables that we need to test for our product and this can change depending on the product for example you will have personal generally you have different personal it could be I ICP If you the B2B space but you want to be able to generate hooks that will Target different personal and you might have seen it here we have sometimes and that's why I said it's not for every product that you want to test this variable but you want to have this variable here you want to call out the people you target to make sure only them will be um involved in reading this message but sometimes you don't want to do it it just depend but in this case we want to do it so we have the person that gives us the call out it's not always the same Persona and call out could be different um in this case for example you could Target consultant but here you will say instead of consultant you will say advisors you know it's just a different way to call them and then you have the message framework and this is the kind of category I told you about so sentiment pain prompts um pain alignment desire future States first person Direct is like kind of we internally um design a gathers examples to that we we we give to AI depending on the message framework to create always the same structure of hooks then you have the angle and the angle is how you will position your products uh on which problem you would position your product for the the prospect to see it because the same product can solve different product problems or it can change the prospect life in different ways right prospects are hoping for different things and this is how you change the angle then you define the model that is just purely technical but sometimes you want to try to use cloud or CH gp4 or O3 mini whatever the model you want to use you define it here and then you click generate it um to generate sorry and start generating hooks once you're done you click generate stat you choose for sorry a template I'm going to show you how you build it and then you click generate Statics now you have the Statics appearing appearing in Google Sheets so one step I haven't talked about yet is that it's very easy to generate hooks but not all of them are good and you don't want to spend $4 on a bad hook so that's why you need human supervision once you have generated plenty of hooks you just go ahead and remove the ones that are not good you can make some changes manual changes on the ones that you like but in the end it needs to be it's not only automation only AI it's like it's just an help to generate hooks quality hooks at scale that a good copywriter should review and okay I think that that's dope we should try it h this one is not good so we shouldn't and do that for the 100 of hooks that you want to try to test that's probably the most time consuming part if you don't want to do it you don't have to but I really suggest uh for you to do it okay now uh I told you about how to that we create the the image automatically with an Automation and now we have a step where we import the image that we just created with the link We import it in the ad account which means we have a number for The Meta ad account that tells us that we can create an ad using this number and the ad will have the image within it now we create the campaign man manually in the ad account and we create the adset that we want and we take the adet ID that we have created right now here we have the different elements of the ad before we generate it so you have the ad name so in this case it's just a concatenation of the Persona and the beginning of the hook it's just for us to find them in the the ad manager as I said we don't have an ad copy but if we wanted to we could add one we have an headline which is very simple and we have a link the link is the where where does the ad lead and you might wonder where do we bring people to it doesn't really matter I mean yes it does you you're better off if you send them to the right page but the the goal of this test is to understand at the ad level what's working and what's not you don't expect any conversion so if you have conversion that's that's fine but we are running traffic campaign so Facebook doesn't even know the conversion is not optimizing for for it so if you have a homepage only can just go for your homepage if you have a small basic landing page just go for the landing page if you don't have that you can even have a a type form for example just talking about your your product in case you are very at the beginning but it doesn't matter anyway we have a link and then we create generate ads and that's the magic the ads appear in the ad account so that was a lot of um tweak with is the meta marketing uh API and make.com that you can see here but in the end it works and we get the ads directly imported in the ad set that we wanted this way we can literally like create so many different hooks make sure they are qualitative they are good hooks generate image sometimes not exactly perfect know sometimes like the font is not really perfect but that that's fine it's still working um and then we import them and we run ads the ads are turning off as soon as they reach a certain number and in the end what you are looking at is okay once they reach this approximate number of impression what is the result and as you can see here you can have like some ads that are um standing out so here's just a screenshot I don't know if I'm going to go into the other account for privacy reasons but you have some that just have like 0.2 and you have some that have five six sometimes 10% and the ones that have 10% you're like okay whoa what what's happening there is something with this world that I chosen that is resonating with people and then you look at who is the the person that's resonating with that and you you test a lot of personals a lot of angles and you end up with this list of I don't know maybe you have five very good hooks or maybe you have 10 depend how much you you tested right and how good we your H hooks but in the end those results are the basis for everything else you do for the ads you create the vsls the landing page the how do you present your product the value proposition the pram it Sol everything but not at the first phase though uh as I mentioned before here we have phases so at the very first time you do it then basically you would uh have a first uh guess like some some ws and then you want to iterate them like make different varations change the use the same problem but with a different emotion uh it was a question then you want to transform in story and then you continue phase two phase three phas phas four phe five until you get to the point that okay this is solid I really have different hooks different uh text different headlines that resonate with my um potential customer quick break here if you're watching this you probably understand how crucial message testing is for scaling ads but here is the thing what I have showed you so far is only one piece of the gross equation that we solve with my team of seasoned marketers we typically help establish businesses doing 50k per month in Revenue sometimes more sometimes less depend of the situation to combine automations that's a thing but the most important full funel optimization to achieve consistent and predictable growth so if you build something successful and you want to scale faster without the usual agency headaches click the link in the description there is a very short 30 second form once you feel it we get back to you and we see if we are a good fit so that said back to the video all right so now let's look at the the system live I was just checking that I'm not um displaying any confidential information uh but I want you to take a look at how it looks so you can scroll and scroll and scroll and all are all in the ad account already and we can continue generating here here um basically you can also just make it a little bit bigger and the cool thing is when you make it bigger you see the ad here okay so how do we generate let's say I want to generate for example for content creator I didn't tell you what's the what the product is on purpose uh but maybe you would guess it's not the the the program here but let's say the call out for content creator is content creator very original but as I said um this might vary uh sometimes you won't have that but for example here's content creators with a an S and here I don't have it because you talk to one person and now we have okay the difference I want story based statement here I want if then if that then that you really understand and this are future state first person direct and sentiment pain prompt okay now I have um no that doesn't work that doesn't work this is completely depending on the product right uh you can have thousand or two it doesn't matter raging six stories or emphasize uniqueness let's say we all have the same angle and here for now I only up does and honestly clo is by far the best one and now I say to generate right so now I start the automation what I just did here is that I have a link that sends a web hook with the information about this specific spreadsheets and now I have this automation that is triggered get the information from the spreadsheet and run uh through the different steps so let's have a look here up we have them generated so let's take a look Sometimes good sometimes less good we will see last week a Creator went from 2% to 12% click through rate just by upgrading the ago here is the exact design that made the difference if if your BR Blends Blends in with thousand other Creator then our human crafted design will make you instantly recognizable in 48 hours imagine having a signature logo that stands out in a sea of templated design making your content instantly instantly recognizable so you can see that those are uh really interesting hooks that have been created it's for you to judge if they are good or not I'm not going to do that now let's have a look at the automation itself self so the goal here is not to it's not a video about how to build automations um but it's for you to understand what kind of automation we can build so as I said we get the data from the spreadsheet here and the three different uh roles that you see here are just simply the same thing it's only one but it's for different um um llms so here's Cloud here's Char pt40 and here is uh all3 mini but that's the name so let's have a look at only one so search hooks to generate so basically look at the the colon here all the ones that have to generate then it rri information and put it together search which one have been generated already same thing then it run through and here is where the magic happens and unfortunately I can't show you that because it's all about uh this specific use case and it's also our special Source this is where we bring together the result of the market research we have done so everything about the brownware promo promoting sorry and um our source our uh direct response copyrighting knowledge to put and we put it together to create a prompt that in the end gets all the information and then it has all the promt that has been created so it doesn't do the same thing again and again and that's the system prompt and then it says generate different hooks um with the following J Jon and here is the Jon and it gives the what we gathered here then here is just to restructure the data and we get every single prompt separate every single hook separately and we update the same spreadsheet we just uh put the the hook here and turn this to generate it so now we know from the spreadsheet that it has been generated all right so now let's talk about uh how we generate the Statics image images so for that I use this tool which for some reason doesn't want to load today U that's a shame because they really good and simple tool you will find the link probably affiliate link if I think about it in the the description of the video so if you want to use it please use my link it still supports the the channel um what it does is that you would create like a kind of canab but instead of using words in your images you use variables so for example you will write headline where you want to have your hook and then you will re you would write call out where you want to write the the color call out and then you can use it in automations so for example here let's uh take a look at the automation itself it's very simple uh receive the data look at the different roles uh and the information generate the render and update the role and basically here the first thing we need to do though is to we have three templates for this case uh and you remember the true or false so here I'm selecting for example only the true or false template you need to make sure it fits to your to th F though U or let's also make headline and here I say to generate and then generates Statics let's take a look inside should arrive now now I see the automation up is and now we have our static the first one if we want to see it a little bit bigger we just have to sorry make it make the row a little bit bigger so that looks okay uh the second one is taking a little bit longer and I'm wondering if it's not because the the the system has a the tool has a problem right now um it hasn't happened so far that's really a shame but that's okay it's okay um you know how it works sometimes even Char GPT is down sometime it's just bad luck that it is today but at least it created one so you know what I'm talking about all right so let's continue with this one and uh we'll go with uh import the creative so here is really easy it's import and then I launch the next step and we should have yes so this means let's have a look at the step maybe we don't open it you got the point anyway so we receive the data we look into spreadsheet to find what we need and then we download the file that we have the link for here we download it through sorry it's not here through an um HTTP request then we upload it to the ad account and that's again is um with the meta marketing API uh that you can build those things it's all about reading the the documentation and creating the API codes we sort up the data and we update the row all right so now we need to look at the different um adset that we have and we pick the one we want to import the add in here for the ad name is just formula we say okay no add copy and I was wondering why I don't have the the different columns is just because I I hided it I hide it I don't know how to say um so just to keep the the privacy and then we say to generate and generate ads and I'm not going to show because I don't want to add an ad that is not relevant for now but you get the point this one is going to trigger this automation which does the same receive the data from Google sheet so get the right data and create the ads with an HTTP uh um request for an API call to The Meta marketing API and then we update our spreadsheet and we have our ad in our ad account so there are a bunch of things I hope that you you got from this video and let me U make a quick recap with what I've have shown you so first of all it's the it's the marketing aspect of it it's at any point you you don't even have to use this system right but you have the message testing framework that you can use to test different messages to find out what works for your product what your potential customers are resonating with it's completely you can do it just doing the same steps and generate um hooks with chat GPT if or or even yourself whatever and go in canva and create the static ads manually and import them manually in your account that's totally fine it works as well it's just a little bit fancier to do it with automation you got that uh but it's also re really faster when you do it at scale but anyway you there is this marketing aspect that I think is the most important piece of this uh video but there is is also the the mental framework of how you can use AI automations because as I said here this is not an AI agent and I don't know it drives me crazy these days like every single post you see it's I mean at least in my Feit because I'm a nerd but every post I see people are talking about agent and they they go ahead and they show you something like that and they say here is an agent it's not it's not an agent that's just an API call right so we are not this is not an agent it's just a series of automations that you can conduct that you can drive with Google sheet you can also do it with air table or whatever tool that you like but the principle is okay what task do I have that requires different steps how can I segment those steps within a spreadsheet and think of okay how can I get an input build the automation that using AI that is going to give me the output I need for the next task and you can use that for everything in this case it's for the this message testing framework but this principle is applicable to you can use like I don't know for customer service you probably have like some some use cases um SEO writing article writing content whatever tasks you have that require different steps that you can h get inputs given outputs follow next then you can use this approach and these days finding people that create this kind of um automations it's it's not that hard what's hard is to think of okay what do I need how do I structure the system but here you have a proper example and finally the last thing was the more technical part uh just so you know that you can actually uh create ads at scale create images ads at scale and and then import them uh directly in your other account if you didn't know that then I hope that it gave you a lot of ideas and with that in mind know that you can also create all kind of sort of ads I mean you it's not only for this specific case it's hooks for static ads but you can also create vsl short script like a briefs for for your ugc creators whatever you want you can create it with the same system so I hope it was useful um let me know in the comment if there is any questions and if you haven't subscribed yet I encourage you to do it right now because uh in the next weeks I'm probably going to show a lot of different uh use cases like that that um not that's not that I'm not talking about the the technical thing because honestly I'm not the best automator out there uh I just understand the system and I use it for marketing and we use it internally in our agency uh to to actually create growth for Brands so if you haven't subscribe yet if you are interested in working with us you will find the link in the description and I see you in the next video bye-bye
