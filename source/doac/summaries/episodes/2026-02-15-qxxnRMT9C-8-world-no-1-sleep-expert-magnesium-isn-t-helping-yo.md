Additionally, it underscores the health risks associated with irregular sleep patterns, suggesting that consistent sleep schedules significantly lower mortality risk and improve heart health.

- Digital detox before bed and understanding melatonin's role can enhance sleep quality.
- The emergence of new sleep aids and therapies offers promising alternatives to improve sleep without the side effects associated with traditional medications.

## Actionable Takeaways

2. Implement a digital detox by avoiding stimulating content one hour before bed.
3. Prioritize sleep hygiene and consider new therapeutic classes like DORAs that avoid the sedative-like effects of older sleep medications.
