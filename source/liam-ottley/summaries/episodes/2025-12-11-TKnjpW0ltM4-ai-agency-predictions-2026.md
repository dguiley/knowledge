# AI Agency Predictions 2026

In this episode, Liam Ottley shares insights into the evolving role of AI technology in business and the strategies agencies must adopt to thrive by 2026.

## Core Thesis
AI technology represents a burgeoning opportunity, with substantial growth expected as businesses seek more defined ROI from AI projects. By 2026, successful AI agencies will focus on developing clear case studies, robust client education, and reliable consulting services, offering comprehensive AI transformation solutions rather than simple automation.

## Key Insights
- **Evolving AI Opportunities**: Agencies must focus on ROI-driven case studies to appeal to a more skeptical market.
- **AI Audits as Catalysts**: Audits facilitate client relationships and improve conversion rates.
- **Importance of Education**: Successful AI implementation requires overcoming the "people problem" through strong educational initiatives.
- **Foundational Software Systems**: Businesses need the right infrastructure before adopting AI solutions.
- **Long-Term Partnerships**: Building strong, personal client relationships ensures sustained success.
- **AI Executives**: The emergence of AI-driven tools offers businesses unparalleled data-driven decision-making capabilities.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Develop clear AI case studies to demonstrate potential outcomes and attract clients.
2. Conduct AI audits to identify opportunities for improvement and facilitate client relationships.
3. Train client teams on AI systems for successful adoption and transformation.
4. Establish robust client relationships through in-person audits and personalized interactions.
5. Hire or train "forward deployed engineers" to bridge consulting and technical execution gaps.

## Notable Quotes
> "2026 will be the year that agencies with clear case studies are going to be able to really crack the market."

> "When you finish this whole process … there’s no value created if you can't get through the people problem."

## Relevance to Wilde Agency
Wilde Agency can leverage these insights by focusing on enriching client relationships through education and personal engagement, enhancing their service offerings with AI audits and case studies, and adopting a model prioritizing sustainable partnerships over volume, which aligns with future industry trends.
