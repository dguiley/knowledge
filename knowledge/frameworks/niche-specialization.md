# The Boring Market Advantage

> Generalist agencies compete on price. Specialists in unglamorous niches command premium margins.

## The Principle

| Generalist | Specialist |
|------------|------------|
| Competes with everyone | Few competitors |
| Price pressure | Margin power |
| Surface expertise | Deep domain knowledge |
| Commoditized | Differentiated |

## Why Boring Wins

"Boring" industries (plumbing, legal, property management, medical billing):
- Lower competition from other AI agencies
- Higher margins (clients value expertise over cost)
- Stickier relationships (switching is hard)
- Deeper moats over time

> "If you go after a boring industry, competition is lower, margins are often way higher."

## The Expertise Flywheel

```
Pick niche → Learn the thing → Do the thing → Teach the thing
     ↑                                              ↓
     ←←←←←←←← Compound expertise ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

Each client in the same niche makes you better at serving all clients in that niche.

## Selection Criteria

Good niches have:
- Painful problems (willing to pay)
- Budget (can afford premium)
- Underserved by AI (low competition)
- Repetitive patterns (expertise compounds)

Bad niches:
- Trendy, obvious (everyone is there)
- Price-sensitive (race to bottom)
- Highly variable (expertise doesn't compound)

## Application

> "Your mission here isn't to conquer the whole AI universe. It's to just become an expert in one of the tiny and valuable hotspots."

Pick ONE niche. Go deep. Resist expanding until you dominate.
