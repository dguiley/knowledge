over 5 million in Revenue he's done over half a billion dollars in sales for their customers 15-year company fully bootstrapped and he's grown almost entirely off of Word of Mouth referrals from his customer base which is incredible so this is a can't miss episode Calvin Carelli let's welcome him to the show I'm Johnny Paige I'm M verle and this is the South Academy [Music] podcast I am very excited today to have SAS founder extraordinaire and someone who honestly I've been inspired by on multiple occasions with conversations we've had Calvin Carelli the CEO and founder of simpo Calvin welcome to SAS Academy podcast man it's great to have you here thank you so much it's great to see you guys again yeah likewise man likewise um so we start this podcast probably you could guess this Calvin we start this podcast the way we start every SAS Academy call I would love for you to just share your perfect intro so people know who they're talking to like who's Calvin what do you do my name is Calvin I my software company is simpo and we help coaches deliver their gift intimately without burning out I love it I love it I love it I love it and before we talk about how you do that I want to um I want to go back to the family for a sec because so our team does research before all of these and one of the things that caught my eye that um that our team wrote down about you is that your mom your mom started a software company in 1980 before the PC was invented is that true like walk us through that that's 100% true yeah my mom was studying chemical engineering so she's a she's a trained chemical engineer uh my dad studied to be a mechanical engineer and they during that time they both met and they met this guy named Christian who was one of the early Pioneers in in software it um back then and like in the 70s and my mom actually dated him uh and he met she my mom met him through her his sister who was studying with my mom so they were colleagues she was like instead of like going out and working for like some painter Painting Company you should go work with my brother he's onto something and my mom um at first actually went to get a job at one of those companies that make paint and and then quickly realized no I need to I need to go do this other thing so she worked there met my my dad through there and um and they ended up marrying and yeah so she got into that world super early both my par parents were programmers in the 70s there's like literally five computers in the entire country they Ed Punch Cards to communicate no keyboards no track pads anything like that Punch Cards holes in a physical piece of paper let's go and yeah it was legendary and then yeah we had a we had a young lady like 16 17y old who would come like a nanny kind of living Nanny young young ladies and one of them fell in love with this guy who was a brilliant software engineer and so my parents teamed up with him so he would write the software my mom would would sell it and Market it my dad has his own company and that's how that came to be I love it so it's no surprise little apples and trees right that uh here you are CEO in a software company today thinking back to when you were a kid like what did that mean to you being surrounded by people on the edge of technology and Entrepreneurship and the whole night yards I feel like that's got to be really cool what what ises that super cool I didn't I didn't quite I think appreciate how cool it was back then right it was just how it was we already always had these different computers at home and I would program my brother was more into playing video games but I would I was coding um it helped too that I was very very insecure and emotionally broken so computers became my safe space where I could you know I could make them do stuff and I felt powerful and not threatened by them um so yeah I really took to it and looking back I'm grateful I I remember reading this book called fire in the valley about the early days of the PC and that whole world and I'm like oh [ __ ] I was there I was there I know this person I know that person like we were we were not in the US we were in Denmark so it was removed but the brother of the guy that my mom partnered with for his software company or for her software company his name is Anders hilburg and he ended up um he worked for he created a pascal compiler which got bought and became TBO Pascal then became Borland then became Deli and then he got hired by Microsoft to do to design.net and CP and that whole universe that was kind of at Microsoft's next platform so yeah the the webs weave deep no doubt and so you were writing code from an early age found kind of your your safe place your at home you know place with technology what's the backstory behind you founding simpo like how did what's been your your journey to land where you are I was um always into software always into entrepreneurships I started several companies in that world I only ever had one job which was for a software company based in Boston around uh 1999 20201 and then other than that I did so I made money from software when I was a kid I was a teacher teenager I and then started my first kind of real adult software company after that after that job and that was a a Services firm like a consulting firm so we did coding for hire I had 13 people on my team at one point and um I always knew I wanted to do product but it was hard like doing consulting someone tells you what what to code is like all right we'll do what you say Building Product you have to have an idea you have to validate the market you have to figure out how to Market it like all that it's like whole different game so I failed many times and it got to a point where I felt like a complete failure like just like oh [ __ ] I'm the worst ever at business and you know like all of it really like I felt like I was a shitty husband and a shitty father and like just terrible and that pain I think we all have that experience of you know the pain is what causes us to actually seek a solution so it was actually a blessing that it got so um so deep for me because that's what started me on my um inner growth Journey so working with a coach and a therapist and a spiritual teacher and some body therapy and I kind of went down that path of of getting help up until that point I had this belief that if you need help if you need coaching if you need therapy anything like that that means you're already broken and you might might as well not exist so I like admitting that I needed help was a huge step for me um and as I went through that Learning Journey of learning to relate to my thoughts and beliefs learning to relate to my feelings which I hadn't like like up until that point I couldn't feel anything uh learning to to have a sense of of purpose or something that I wanted to give to the world not so much purpose in terms of like I want to build thing blah blah blah but more like this is the impact this is the energy that I want to bring to people and um I I was like that those things that I've learned here are so valuable for all of the entrepreneurs that I know right all struggling with our thoughts and our beliefs that are making us feel crap or like you know we know the emotional roller coaster of Entrepreneurship like it goes well and we're happy and then it like something bad's happen we're down like all of that stuff right and and especially in the tech world I saw so many people who were who were pitching their startups and it was like it sounded like a good idea but there's no heart there's no like purpose behind it like there's no like why are you doing this and what I saw is that it's like people I read this essay by Paul Graham that says no startup ever died mid keystroke no startup ever died mid keystroke if you're still typing away the keyboard the start startup's still alive you might have run out of money you might not have any team members left you might not have any customers but you're still it's still alive so I was like whoa if we're doing something that we feel is the reason that we were put here on the on on the planet and we deal with our emotions and our and our beliefs then that's going to dramatically increases your likelihood of actually getting there right if it's like if it's why I'm here I'm not going to just give up because it didn't work out and so that what that's what led me to I I need to teach this to others and as I did that I didn't know anything about seminars or workshops or anything and so I was like okay great like how do I teach this and that led me to online courses and online marketing and as I did that I was like great I can do this I realized that the software was complicated you needed like eight nine different tools like website email marketing shopping cart uh membership site video hosting you know like all of the things and I was like that seems complicated let me build something that makes it simpler and that is simpo there's a lot topack there go ahead Johnny yeah so Calvin put us on the timeline you started in 2001 is when you had the last like regular job you have a couple business failures that exposed not only they need to get better in the in the business Arena but also just work on the inner game where when do you start to realize and conceive the idea of around providing tooling for people trying to help other people have a similar transformation I said so that was 2008 um there was a moment where I sat down I was still doing consulting I was i' scaled my company down to just me because I didn't want to run a consulting firm I just not needed to put put bread on the table and I like things kept crashing down around me and it was like one of those I was like okay is this the the universe God trying to tell me that I should sit down and figure out what I'm here to do because I'd had been avoiding that question and um I decided it was and I sat down and it was like a moment of coming up with the process going through the process and really the outcome was that I got this clear felt sense of I'm here to integrate spirituality and Entrepreneurship and by spirituality I mean what I talked about before we relate to our thoughts and our feelings and our and our sense of purpose of meaning and really realize that that the job of the like of the purpose of the business is to to be share love to expand our capacity to be in love and to share that love with the world and and and also to realize that I think of our business as our spiritual gym like I go to business to real reveal where I'm still not free as a person and that becomes my my like my the way that I free myself because that's ultimately what we're what we're what we want um and so it was that download of I need to I need to teach this to others that then let me to create the software but at the same time I realized I can't all right so the challenges that we're facing as society as Humanity are manyfold there are lots of them what is it that will solve those problems and I think about it at two levels one is what will solve the problems that we're having is a different mindset a different belief system a different level of Consciousness right the there's a alanine quote you can't solve a problem with the same level of Consciousness that created it so we need a different level of Consciousness how do you do that well you do that through coaching teaching educating learning so that's one level the other level is who solves problems in the world it's who solves the big problems in the world well a it's not governments governments are typically in the business of making problems so they can run on the failed thing things they already did that fail so running the same thing again like governments don't solve problems they make problems nonprofits typically don't solve problems they like it's not their thing but entrepreneurs that's all we do right we get paid to solve problems I'm not talking about big corporations that are that are buying off government politicians and can change the laws and all that stuff but like what we do us people we're in the business of solving problems so if but if the entrepreneur is not um is like projecting all of their garbage all of their false beliefs all their unhealed emotional trauma out into the work work that they do then it's not going to be as effective so if we can help entrepreneurs evolve and and raise their level of Consciousness and that then they can be the great great great the greatest Catalyst for positive change in the world and I can't do that on my own but I can create a platform that allows other people to to do that work and supports other people in doing that work Calvin why do you think it is that entrepreneurs have so much of their identity tied up in their businesses it's a great question I think it's because um what happens between the ages of one and two that's why it's because of what happens between one and two so when we're when we're born it's all like generally dopamine it's all like good feelings connection love with our moms and all that stuff now when we and there obviously exeptions to that but but generally speaking once we start to be able to move about we get in trouble it's like stop don't do that don't jump off the ledge of this and don't fall down the stairs and don't put your hand on the stove top and all that stuff so we get this like hey I'm out exploring it's awesome like boom no stop like boom and so chemically we go from dopamine to noradrenaline and it's like oh [ __ ] and then if we don't get held there and brought back to dopamine it starts to create that split that says that it's not that this Behavior me putting the hand on the stove toop or about to that was bad it's me that's that's wrong in some way and so we get into we get into needing to prove ourselves needing to achieve and I think that's a huge part of it is that like of why we become entrepreneurs is because we we have this need to to achieve and prove and and show that we're good and all that ship on the shoulder kind of thing right we all have it something to prove yeah yeah totally and so you know then and then the business becomes the proof of whether we are good or bad yeah that's interesting so I you said something else that I I wrote down on my iPad because I never want to forget it you said business is your spiritual gym um which I love you know we talk about that a lot like you mentioned the talked about the law of the lid right and you know entrepreneurship being the most intense self-development program in the world and and I'll talk more more more accurate ask you more about self-development and your work with coaches in a minute but what I would love to know is for people who aren't entrepreneurs there are team members who listen to this podcast employees there's nothing wrong with not being an entrepreneur but how does someone who is not in this cauldron that brewed all three of us like how do they get the same dose or a similar effect like if you're not running a business to push you in these areas like how do you get better at this stuff man that's a great question I get like what drives people to do anything right is the desire or the pain um and desire is sort of a form of pain as well so there has to be and the reason the desire is a form of pain is that there's like oh I don't have the thing that I desire right so there's that lusting after it I have a dog she's right there and like you see her you throw a ball she [ __ ] wants that ball right there's desire there and then she gets the ball and she's like all right now what right so it's like is the chasing so yeah we change Chase we change we we we drive when there's something that we want to chase so whatever that is um for each person is different that's interesting and so it's really like resolving unmet needs right or figuring out how you go about doing that as opposed and business is just the tool that you've used used and that I've used similarly in Johnny as well to to figure out how to do that yeah yeah yeah and usually there's like for me one of the things I've realized is that in business I'm I'm driven I'm motivated by intimacy the the thing that gives me money or sorry it gives me money gives me energy is having moments of intimacy with my clients with my team with my audience and it took me a long time to realize that that's okay like I had this like oh you have to like ask to be the business and the money and the growth and like all these things I'm like actually there's zero energy for me there intimacy is where the energy is and for each person again there's going to be what is what is the thing that gives them energy that makes them want to do that and as a leader being able to tie into that and know that and and design roles and jobs and and a team that allows people to pursue that and to be driven by that that's how you get the most from people that's how they're they enjoy it the most I do I want to ask you more about that Calvin but hey listener there are a few things I've known Calvin for a few years from now and in this podcast we're going to uncover a couple of his competitive advantages that you can learn from this right here is one of them Calvin has been able to endure he has durability in the business and it's fueled by the passion I like the the the story of why you started simpo the problem you're trying to achieve is a huge competitive Advantage the people who are just Builders looking for a product and disconnected from the why the the keyboard stops stroking a lot sooner than when you're fueled by a really big why and I I've just you've shown up with that passion in every one of the interactions that we've had together part why I want to have you on the podcast but I love this hey I'm fueled by the the moments of intimacy can you like that word means a lot of different things to a lot of different people can you like describe like what did you when did you start to realize this and tell me what tactically what do you do to make sure there's more of that in your day like what does it look like to pursue intimacy versus you know Revenue growth and how do you prioritize it I love everything that you just said and asked about so in terms of staying power this company has its 15th birthday on Saturday nice it's been this Saturday 15 years it's 15 years since the first code checkin that I made like May 11 um whatever that is like 2009 yeah so definitely staying power and like you said like that's only because this this what I'm doing now I feel like is what what I'm here to do all of it not just the software part but the coaching part as well so the way intimacy shows intimacy shows up is um our our customer service it's something that that we've I've been trying to explain if you go to our trust pilot you will see everybody's raving about our customer service and when you say that people like like great you give an answer really quickly and that's awesome no it's not that it's it's much more than that it's that we build a team of people who really see our customers really relate to our customers really connect with our customers really understand where they're at and and obviously gives them the answer and we're I'm very like we don't want to ever just like give a superficial quick answer without like we take the time to understand where they're at and what they mean even if they don't know how to articulate it right so for example um like we'll we'll we've built tools and I I used to do customer service myself and we built our own Customer Service Tool tooling we don't use intercom or help desk or Zend disk or anything like that so we can see whenever people submit a ticket I can see the 10 pages they visited in the app right before submitting that ticket so now if they are not telling me what thing this is about we can just click that link and go see what they're talking about because they forgot to mention it so we can instead of then asking about it and then wasting time Cycles on that we can get to the right answer but deeper than that is that level of connection with people that's what we offer and it's something when people experience it they're like oh my God this is next level um and and they really love it I we also do coaching so we have our simp Academy where we work with um members on simpo plus plus other people who are not on simpo and work with their business and that's where like before this call this podcast here I was on my weekly coaching call with that group and it's it's it's we're pract I'm practicing that business as your spiritual gym thing so like when you're when you're working on stuff and you're struggling with something what it really points to is the deeper underlying limiting belief that once we can uncover that we can get freedom I had I had someone who came in she was literally on food stamps and she didn't have eight bucks to um buy socks or get her dog's to nails clipped and she borrowed 1,500 from her mom so that she could join simp Academy for one month and then that in that one month she made double that investment back and she hadn't made anything near that forever and it was all mindset right she's a talented pianist and she's teaching how to improvise and it's great and like she was just all the mindset stuff we had a session where she actually brought something up I think about a boyfriend and relationship which is not really like a business issue but it was a pattern that was impacting every area in her life just like like it always is which is why we can work on business stuff to get to like the Deep stuff that's impacting every other area and then I just helped unlock for her all of her labels and diagnoses and just be instead of being like Oh I'm this way I'm that way I'm like all that stuff and just help her be and she was like I can't believe I've spent like so much time and so much money on therapy and like I get this like I get this from a software company like this is where I got my freedom and and for me that's why I do it realizing this is quite recent it's like six months ago that I was talking with one of my mentors and he was he helped me unpack so he's he's an interesting character he works on energy stuff and he is like words and concepts are linked energetically for us and so what he helped me unlock is that I had success and failure and shame kind of all linked together in the same place because I had this programming that says if I'm very is if I'm very successful then I'm going to be disloyal to my family and so that's bad and so that's really failing so it's like if I succeed I fail if I fail I succeed and and either way I'm I'm like I'm shame there's shame not a good not a good energy and so for me it was like when I went went to work on marketing or growth stuff I would go to that place that kind of same energy of success and failure and all that stuff and like nothing freaking happens it's all like jumble stuff but intimacy for me is something that's high energy and so if I that's where I put my focus and my attention like this is not about marketing or success or any of that stuff it's about intimacy how can I create more intimacy let's create systems and processes that generate that create moments of intimacy okay now I'm excited now I'm energized now I like it know I'm I've got the juice that I need to go so I love that for a lot of reasons but it seems like if I were to if I were to spit that back it's not it's optimizing for client results but more with a little bit more depth right because there there could be a lot of ways to get client results it's really optimizing for for client results in a way that also fills up your heart with like this is how we do things this is why we do things which I love and I think people want people want is maybe it's our audience is special right we're not we're not like a B2B Enterprise corporate sass right we're B2B but our B is like tiny it's usually just one person and it's a part-time side hustle they trying to get up and running or like and then eventually they do right but they're very small so what they need more than anything is to be seen and heard and felt because they typically feel like Outsiders in their own circles they're the weird ones that dare to go out and do this thing and they've probably worked on their own personal growth for years a little bit in in private right so they've evolved a lot on the inside but other people might not see that as much and so there's that disconnect so offering them that where we actually really make them feel seen is value for them and is part of the success path because they they need to be seen in order to allow themselves to be seen out in the world yeah and I want to call something out for the founders listening to this right now if you were paying attention at all you you just notice the depth that Calvin talks about his customer base with right like it's not just about you know the demographics and the firmographics and they run a business that looks like X that makes y Revenue that stuff is table Stakes it's about like what do they need emotionally how can I show up in this relationship to make them feel seen and heard and felt and and we'll talk more about how that's impacted your your growth in a second but just for the for a quick opportunity to hold up the mirror to a Founder that's listening that might say to themselves [ __ ] I don't know if I know my customer as well as Calvin does like everything you want in your business is on the other side of getting to know your customer at that level and this is one of those Corners that you simply can't cut right there's choices you can make on marketing channels or go to market strategies like not knowing your customers is not a choice you can make in my opinion in Calvin man you're lead leading from the front on like what it means to actually know your customer and the coaching having the coaching program is a game changer for that I didn't I got this cheat code right yeah I got into this business because I was doing coaching but then I got I talk myself out of it and I was like let me just do the software and focus on that and so it's it wasn't I think it's like a year and a half ago that I got back into the coaching b game myself and it's been complete GameChanger because now I'm intimate with my customers every single week and they show me exactly what they're struggling with and even and it tells me how I need to grow as well yeah man I love that and so when we talk about simpo now that we have all of that context and I I'm trying to draw a through line for everyone listening here um Calvin what can you share about the the state of the business today like team size or Revenue whatever you're comfortable sharing like what's the business look like today we're about 30 people all over the world and uh we are at 5 million annual revenue and um yeah what else do you want to know it's I I'm super proud of the team I I have to say um it's been it's been a massive journey and I've learned so much from you guys from SAS Academy about the team side of things it's been immensely helpful I didn't there's so much I didn't know about how to build a team how to structure how to lead how to like the orc chart all of those things insanely helpful think about like I grew I got really good at computers because I was terrified of people so like getting into coaching was like a huge step I remember when my first coach coach she was like I think you should take a coach education you could become a great coach I'm like are you are you crazy like I'm not a people person like I behind a keyboard for a reason so so um you know the team like all of my crap about like feeling unworthy and unvaluable and all of that stuff has made it really difficult to build a team but there's always been that like very I've always been very real with my team so they've been part I've people on my team been with me for like six seven years and that have seen that Evolution and growing with people in this way is just magnificent and now we've got I've really got stuff dialed in where got such good people really investing in coaching I do uh weekly team training with my whole team where it's a lot of it is on all of this inner growth stuff because I want them to thrive and find inner freedom and find their their um Just Energy love motivation all of those things for them in their lives outside of the company and so yeah the team side of things is really really working well um yeah that's cool but there's one thing about your team that I think most Founders would be surprised by as we were talking about right before we started recording is that you've gotten this far above a $5 million annual run rate really without a long-term marketing hire right and I think that a lot of this if I had to take a guess goes back to what you were talking about earlier about being like maniacally focused on building intimacy and driving results for your customer base but dude can you unpack that for a second just I'd love for you to talk through the strategy of how you grow without focusing on marketing yeah it's very simple you make a great product and you offer great customer service and then you let your your customers talk about you to other customers that's that's how that's what how we've done it um do you did you have to formalize anything around the the latter third of that flywheel about like the word of mouth and you doing affiliate stuff or or is it just organically happening because it's just a high quality experience it's organically happening we we do have an affiliate program that nobody's been managing forever and um so people do sign up for it it didn't when when we went from not having affiliate program to having an affiliate program it didn't move the needle at all it didn't make a difference to how many people they referred yeah we we do have a few that are definitely referring because of the affiliate program but there's nothing you can't notice any you're not going to notice anything in the graph um so it's really not very formalized um we're looking at right now actually if there are things that we can do to formalize a little bit more um but no it's it's just really pouring into the people Dan always says build the build the people the people build the business right so it's pour into the people to have the right people and have them have the right mindset and um that's that's it that's the game I love it simple not easy you know I saw a tweet the other day it's actually very timely and it said uh I can't remember who it was from but the person basically said that a CEO who's really good at a certain business function will manage you in that function much differently than he'll man he or she will manage you in a different function and I imagine for you that customer success hat is firmly planted on your head right where I would imagine you have an incredibly High bar for for how these interactions go does that resonate with you do you feel that way or it's um somewhat I I feel it's somewhat different it's for me my experience has been when I find the right person that has the right attitude and mindset and I see that they got it like I'm out of there like I'm Not Gon to mess with [ __ ] anything so I I was lucky early on to find my head of customer success her name is Dianna she's been she's my the the the person that's been with me the longest and she's just built that team and she crushes it it's half the the the the team member base because a lot of them are are part-time in different countries we have we have support in in multiple languages as well like we have team members that do multiple languages so we can do support in all time zones 247 multiple languages so um I love it yeah so no and I had the same thing with with engineering at one point I had a an engineer who came in and we were just completely aligned he was just way better than me and so I'm like all right you got this like I'll help you with some direction here and there like in terms of where I want to go but you own this and then he left and then it was a struggle for me to find the people and build a team it took me a year of like you know thrashing around till I figured out how to build the team and then it took me longer still to figure out how to build a product team and like lead a product a team engineering team and so in that way I resonate because I was that was my strength and so figuring out how to delegate that in the right way was was challenging because I then I made the mistake of once I found not one person to replace that one like it was literally just me and then I found this one guy and then we were coding together and I'm like all right you're way better and way faster smarter than me you go do that I'll go do these other things which at that point was make music like I had this phase where I was like I want to learn how to sing and produce and write songs and all that stuff so I can of spent a lot of time doing that I was like not at all serious about like being the CEO and running a company or anything uh but it was awesome and then um when he left I and it took me a year then I finally figured out how to hire great engineers and then then I had three and then after a while of working with these three programs I'm still part of it then I was like okay you guys got it like go run with it that was I don't believe in mistakes but if there were mistakes that would be one so so uh they what I didn't realize is like I'm like I've always been that engineer I'm the CEO I'm the product manager I'm the designer I'm the engineer I'm like the customer service person I'm all of these things I'm also the person that did the thing that my customers do like I started doing online courses and online marketing and all that stuff so I know that words I know all this stuff and like now I just figure out what to build and I build it turns out when you hire an engineer out from the street they don't know all of those things right so if they're just like go build the thing and then they they're like oh I'm gonna they don't have a product manager and they don't have a designer and they don't have anything like they sometimes make make a mess so that was definitely a learning experience and we still don't have product management by the way like I I do that and I I've coached my engine years to do a lot of the things that a product manager would do that's cool yeah it's typically the last hat you'll you'll hand off um and it's there's there's some CEOs that'll hold on to the product management hat well through 10 million it's just a you have an incredible cheat code with 15 years of context being the practitioner yourself like that's those are some big shoes to fill yeah um and ones that often times take time so I want to ask you cin a couple questions hang on Johnny let me just out she's barking over here yeah go for it by the way I made I made the product manager mistake as well where I hired someone who was super smart 23 years old and came in and I made him head of product instead of just a product manager I made him head of product and now he felt like he owned all of it and so my all of my 15 years of expertise were just not were ignored right so that was another way to mess it up so I do want to talk well I got two different lines of questions I want to make sure that we come back to I want to talk business strategy for a minute on typically when we we hear companies serving so we're exclusively B2B we've got the three most common segments are like Enterprise mid Market SNB and then you have a few in the very small businesses which is what you know the solopreneurs the startups which is the space that you're in and typically what hear that that's synonymous with like really high churn right you just have so many business failures and and those are the of all of the your different segments very small business segment would be the one with highest turn so you typically would have really high acquisition numbers like your traffic and your acquisition trial starts and you new customers really high also turn really high to create growth I'm curious one is that true and then two is that where the coaching business came in because you can help business failure is a number one driver return in a very in a very in a company that serves very small businesses you can help make them more successful if you launch the coaching room so I'm just curious like for those serving the vssb um segment how important like talk to me through validate hey was that true in your in your scenario and then two how important or how impactful has the coaching been on your turn numbers the our churn is just south of 2% per month which is is world class for that customer segment yeah for that oh yeah 100% yeah yeah so hey if listener listen up this is another one of those moments where where you're G to benefit from Calvin's 15 years in this space so has it always been 2% like what was it pre and post coaching our LTV is around 5,000 with a with an arpo of 137 is last time I checked so people stay for a long time um yeah on average right so part of that is is and your question is like is the coaching program the coaching program is not yet um impacting those numbers but I think that definitely that whole um the intimacy part is a lot because people feel connected yeah and so they're going to stick with it longer because of that and I'm doubling down and leaning into a lot more of the coaching and educating side of things which is another like again the cheat code of me being in the business that they're in so all of the systems and processes around doing my coaching program the the simpler Academy or our coaching program I'm learning all the ins and outs of that business again so that I can be a better leader for people even those who are not in the coaching program yeah awesome cool I love it hey I want to go back to so two we wanted uh to chase down the other thread is man in 15 years you have got a you've got learned a lot of lessons on the leadership and building the team most Founders we work with at SAS Academy going to fall into two buckets one is a technical founder who they're they're typically going to have two blind spots and that is leading the team and the go to market strategy and then we will have the other cohort is he have really strong on uh product and go to market and I've got to go figure out the engineering side like I I know the problem I want to solve I got a strong go to market background I'm non-technical and so you know team management is a shared Achilles heel across all all founders is part of becoming a great leader and um and at every level of business there's a new level of requirements on leadership so i' I'd love to hear your Evolution as a leader like what do you think you've learned over 15 years talk to us a few of those maybe not mistakes maybe they're very expensive lessons where you you you thought we needed X it actually turned out you needed y like if you were to gift the founder listening to this call a few of the hard-earned lessons that you've learned and they get to go make new mistakes and learn from yours what are some of those Evolutions you've had as a leader the core ones are I feel like it always comes down to those big inner shifts that then unlocks something that I didn't even realize like I had no idea what that was big one that happened a few years ago really big one was was um all right I'm gonna start slightly different so one of you asked me like one of the the expensive mistakes the the expensive mistake that I kept making over and over again was trying to hire someone else to essentially be the leader of my company H so I hired a COO to like like you're going to run the company and he was kind of in between me and all the the team leads at the time um I hired a a chief of staff at one point trying to kind of get him to do it I was seriously contemplating bringing in uh like a president uh from another company in our space and actually making him either president here or the CEO and then kind of me being more in a chairman like Visionary position and the the big the big realization was I I was working with a coach named Larry who was a former Navy SEAL and he had this process of uncovering your your core trauma so his theory is that whatever like whatever traumas you've experienced there's basically one that's kind of the primary that's the core one you experienced where now your brain saw a pattern it did something and you survived because you're here today and so the lesson for that subconscious mind of yours is that's a successful strategy and I'm going to keep looking for p things that match this pattern so I can apply the strategy over and over and over again whether it works or not and so he'll ask some questions and then kind of kind of get to like what is the core what is the underlying thing here for me the UN what he helped me uncover was my birth trauma which I was already aware of but he helped me understand the impact so I was born strangled in my own abicial cord not breathing all blue um basically near death and and then you know they smacked me and they did whatever and they I got started breathing again and then they put me in an incubator for 48 hours to make sure that I was good and I was breathing and I was going to survive which is awesome I appreciate they did that what that and what was fascinating was that Larry had the same birth trauma so he was familiar with this and when he's like what he helped me see is that for him and for me has created this pattern of being half in half out it's like you born near death near dead and you have I have no memory of this but we've heard those stories of the tunnel and the light on the other side and all that and then obviously I chose to come back here so I'm here now but there's that like oh this thing might be better so I'm not really sure if I want to be in or out and I can see once he pointed that out I was like oh crap that's exactly what I've been doing with my company I kind of want I don't know what I want like I'm not sure I want it like can I hire someone else to be the CEO hire someone else to lead the company like I can see I've done that in in relationships my first marriage I can see how I've done that in so many areas of my life and so that was the wakeup cold for me to realize to decide no I want this I want to be the [ __ ] leader I want to be the one that that I'm want to be the CEO I want to be the one that that figures this out that grows that as a person to own that and that made all the freaking difference to the team to me to like yeah the effectiveness of the team right because you can see how being the leader and being like I I don't really want if I want know if I want to be the leader like constantly like like that half aptica but also not abating right so you're not really finding someone to replace because you're like ah I still want to be like it's a terrible place to be yeah can you help me understand ta like help help the the founder listening and me understand tactically what what should I take away from if I if I hey Calvin what you shared is super inspiring what do I go do to be um like I'm curious how how that ties in with hey I tried to hire a product manager you know I got too far away or hey I hired three Engineers turns out like there's some tactical experience around building the team that you've like you've learned some lessons around there's also the unlocks for you as you progress in the inner game uh that unlock new leadership capacity and the way you show it for the team help me like tie the two together so there is a tactical level of like go go invest in that that work find a mentor find a coach find someone who can help you see these patterns because these patterns are what's going to unlock everything else and the Beautiful Thing is once you unlock that which is basically just getting Awareness on it and really specifically and clearly seeing what the pattern is then all the other [ __ ] takes care of itself right think of it this way we want certain act we want certain results in our world right business growth Freedom time whatever money um we want results results come from actions actions come from our thoughts and our feelings our thoughts and our feelings though come from that un those deep underlying beliefs like I'm not sure I want to be here like I'm not safe I'm not good enough I'm not worthy something's wrong with me I'm not wanted I'm my voice doesn't matter like whatever those beliefs are and our energy State and so really what I'm all about is like let's identify what those core beliefs are so that we can see them and then as we see them they dissolve so one level tactical is really freaking look there spend your time doing that because otherwise you can fight at the actions level or the thoughts and feelings level but you're doing it uphill because there's something underlying that's really driving it all right so we can like if you want to lose weight you eat less and you exercise more and like that's it yet there's a multi-billion dollar dieting industry because like people don't do that and why don't they do it well because their thoughts and their feelings what are their thoughts and feelings come from from all these other so that's really like I think that's the big takeaway if you're asking at a more practical it is like what are the things one of the things for me was and again size back to the personal journey is I had this belief that that people should know this people should know certain things and that was me as a kid I felt like my dad had this attitude towards me oh I should know this oh I'm ashamed that I don't know this like let me go study really hard so I know this thing and like get out of that trap so I was projecting that onto my team and saying oh you should know things rewriting that in my brain to like obviously you have higher engineer they need to be able to like write some code and whatnot but generally speaking I can't expect them to know certain things until I've taught them how to do it and I coach them and I've trained them right so for example on the product management side now that I don't have product management um I've been coaching and training my Engineers how to how to what kind of questions to ask what how to think about it and then when it breaks down every once in a while rarely I'll step in do it and they'll have them observe then I'll have them reflect like what did you learn from this what were the principles how do you how can you apply this I love that man I think that I don't know I firmly believe that the Hallmark of a good leader is your ability to coach people to success I don't think there's any other skill that's that's more outfront than that um but hearing what we've heard about you and you explaining your story so far you know you run a company that serves coaches you've hired a lot of coaches you coach your team you coach your clients what makes a world class coach you can only lift people to where you've gone so the the going going deep into your own world again like there there are different kinds of coaches right there are coaches that work at the level of actions all right do this and then you hope that people follow and then you have like a 3% success rate people don't do the thing even it's like if you would just do the thing you would get the right there are coaches who work on on thoughts mindset that's that's pretty common right there are some that will work on the emotional side of things the emotional side is really important because like everything is driven by feelings um and what we the reason we want the result is because we want to feel a certain way from having the result right so um and a lot of like we all have these places that emotionally we're not willing to go I'm not willing to let myself feel certain feelings and so that part but they're still impacting your your be actions your behavior so that part is really important and so it depends on how deep you want to go as a coach but like if you want to really go all the way and really help unlock people then yeah you have to go that deep with yourself and you know I look at these as a as a relationship I think any good coach would so naturally I want to ask your thoughts on the other side of the coin too right if you've made the decision to hire a coach and you want to get coached how do you show up as a worldclass recipient of of that coaching what's the right mindset don't just listen to the words but listen for their being for their state of being with my one of the first online courses I bought this was in 2008 I would listen to the audio recording the audio version of this of this course and then I would listen for the content and then I would kind of rewind and then listen again for the context how is this person relating to money to business to marketing to teaching to coaching to his a to his audience to his life to himself what can I absorb from that by just kind of not listening but like listening at a deeper level tuning into what it is because I think that's the gift right that's the gift is is I I believe that ultimately as coaches our what we offer is not the specific strategies and tactics and all that stuff people can find that on YouTube and all over the Internet and in books and all that it is it is our be it's like they get to be with us it's our it's our it's who we are that's our ultimate service to people and so knowing that embodying that sharing that and then as a coaching client listening for that and and absorbing that that's interesting man there's so many opportunities I feel like for SAS Founders to incorporate these principles into the way that they show up for their customers you know I think that we talk a lot about I say this constantly Calvin I'm always like software as a service like those words have meaning service is in the name right it says it on the bottle right it doesn't just mean recurring billing which maybe what is what it originally meant right now like no this is actually the word there's yeah yeah and I like I I inverted honestly I just I'm just GNA start calling it Services of software you know honestly it's almost better here first that's exclusive we actually did um love as a service um interesting yeah yeah you should like bring that back I was it was one the COO that I hired Matt is he's a great guy but didn't work out as a CEO but we thought of we looked at actually trademarking love as a service and like making it a thing and a whole like yeah a whole thing maybe we'll maybe we'll do that yeah I just I just think if someone's listening to this right now and they're you know hardcore software person and they're like how does this apply to me I just I love your thoughts on it too guys but I just feel like you have to coach your clients to the outcome that you want them to have and I think that your software is one of the tools in your toolbox of ways that you can do that but like Calvin I feel like you're really leading from the front on this concept of also delivering the knowledge based on your own experience and a one to many environment that that is part of customer success I feel like that's part of a CS team is is coaching these clients to success is there any other anything else you'd add to that think of it this way like really vibration frequency whatever you call it like we all know that we see some person and you can just see they're like like walk down the street and you're like that looks like that's gonna be [ __ ] miserable right and then you see another person who just like like ah like there you know that like energy vibration frequency whatever that thing is is real it's very very real and so when you get clients that come to you any entrepreneur right we get clients they want like yeah Enterprise is kind of its own like its own thing like goes it do with the thing right like but most people who are are working with entrepreneurs who working with smaller people it's it's like people want an outcome what what they really want is they want a change in their energy their frequency their state their vibration whatever like that because that is then what that's what they're after and also that's what what's going to bring the result in the out outer world and so acknowledging that like our job is not just to ride the software our job is that that we lift people in this way that we kind of pour into our people with with love with energy and we also understand we have empathy and compassion for people we've all been that person like no like I stuck stay in my stuck Place You' all been there so like instead of when when clients show up in that way just love them more like yeah I get where you're at and we don't need to it we don't need to shame them for it or make them wrong for it just get to love them more um but it's like you know if you're because I coach coaches right so if you're if you're someone who's you know I have someone who's does keto for example why do people want to do keto well they may be a health issue or maybe they want to lose lose weight or something right well that health condition that they're struggling with or they their overweight that they think they have anyway is tied to their level of frequency so we can again we can give the all strategies but really we got to also pour into that energy level and really understanding that that's part of the job that's part of the service as a software it's like software as a service love as a service like it's part of the job is to to help people Elevate in that way and when we do then the software becomes like becomes less important and the value like the of and the LTV and the the the Cs and churn all stuff becomes better because they their lives just get better from being in your Universe yeah no I love that man it's the I frequently describe the software as a vehicle it's it's a delivery vehicle is what it is it's helping you accelerate your outcome and deliver it more scalably or whatever word you want to use but at the end of the day it's not the magic it's just the the vehicle it's what it is I think of it as the excuse to get to do what we do right the that have these moments of intimacy the excuse to have this impact on people in their lives and yeah yeah it's like it's the carrier wave to what is really about dude I love it it's been a fun conversation man so we went we had a I think a beautiful Arc through this I mean from from Calvin as a small child getting inspired right from your parents and both on coding and Entrepreneurship to just building a a true culture around intimacy and driving customer results and seeing how it can scale a company to 5 million and higher without having to go crazy on marketing and then obviously your own self-development Journey has been um honestly really inspirational to hear and the same way that we have a way that we start a podcast we also have a way that we end a podcast one of our favorite questions and so I I'd love to ask you man when it's all done and the page is turned on Calvin what's the thing you want to be remembered for above all else that I helped people feel their own hearts and heal them a little bit heal them themselves I love it man I think you're well on the way I would imagine your customers would say the same about you man so uh look I just want to give you some gratitude brother honestly thank you for for coming on and lending us some time and just sharing so openly from from everything that you shared along your own Journey business and personal it uh means the world and I think this episode's going to uh hopefully Reach Out And Touch a lot of people man so thank you so much for uh for spending the time with us my pleasure I love you guys love everything that you do anyone who's watching I just want to say if you're considering joining Sasa company freaking do it it's been a lifechanging experience for me I'm so glad that I did um even though it felt scary it felt like a truck ton of money and all of that but it's just been it's been insane it's been amazing dude I appreciate you saying that yeah it's been fun working with you Calvin you're somewhat you're you're a model student like it's no surprise to me that you've leveraged coaching and and just outside support before and areas of your life because you you show up as someone who's like ready to ready to learn and put in the work and um man it's just uh it's been cool to see I said it before we started recording the podcast but we we not only exist to help the founder win in the business Arena but to win in life and you're just a great example of someone who's like who's who's doing both and uh yeah so appreciate you coming on just sharing the you know how how you think I think you can learn a lot one of the the biggest tools we have to transform Founders is through osmosis so look I'd love to have you if you're a Founder listening to the podcast i' love to have you in s Academy if not what I'm going to do is I'm going bring the founder to you through the podcast so you can learn get into Calvin's brain for a while and how he how he thinks and uh and hopefully you've placed an emphasis now on two things if you leave with two things for them to be this and Calvin I'll turn it over to you to double down on the one is the importance of the inner game and how it uh uh either in Ables you or holds you back as a leader observe where am I winning right now and where could I use some attention and bring some awareness to what's that next level look like and the second one is a customer success L growth strategy win for the customer first and trust that if you do that well they'll take care of your marketing for you so two takeaways Calvin great anything else you hope the founders listening to this call takeaway do what you do cuz you love doing it and because it gives you energy to do that like really tying into the energy because you said you said like winning again and I noticed like for me winning is not a so it's not a positive word for me there's no energy there victory that's different there's energy but like really notice like and again like business marketing no energy you know intimacy lots of energy so really notice what where you get your energy what is energizing for you and whatever it is is okay like it doesn't have to look a certain way I love it ma'am I love it great stuff Calvin appreciate you taking the time thank you thank you for being for doing what you're doing and for changing my life [Music]
