# Elevator Story v4

Softening exclusivity. Clarifying the codebase/foundation. Finding the right tone.

---

## Terminology Lock

- **Codebase / Foundation** (not platform) - the battle-tested code we build on
- **Protocol** - the SaaS for managing knowledge and execution
- **Experience × AI** - the tagline/multiplier

---

## Why External Projects (The Honest Framing)

Not "rare access" or "occasionally we open the door" (abrasive).

Instead:
- **Funding** - client work funds the venture mission
- **Exercise** - real projects stress-test and improve the codebase
- **Partnership** - aligned work, not just billable hours

Tone: We *want* the right external projects. They make us better.

## Wilde Agency Elevator Refinement

### Attempt 1: The Mutual Benefit
> "We're a venture studio. We build software products on a codebase we've refined for 30 years.
>
> We also take on select external projects—as clients or partners. It funds our mission and exercises the foundation.
>
> You get 30 years of compounded decisions. We get a stronger codebase. It works."

### Attempt 2: The Foundation Story
> "Every software project starts somewhere. Most start from scratch. We start from a foundation—30 years of patterns, optimized decisions, hard problems already solved.
>
> We use it to build our own ventures. We also build with select clients and partners.
>
> Their projects exercise the foundation. The foundation accelerates their projects. Everybody wins."

### Attempt 3: The Flywheel
> "We built a codebase over 30 years. Experience × AI, compounded into a foundation.
>
> We use it to launch ventures. We also build with external clients and partners—their projects strengthen the foundation, and the foundation accelerates their projects.
>
> It's a flywheel. The more we build, the better it gets."

### Attempt 4: The Straightforward One
> "Wilde Agency is a venture studio. We build software on a foundation we've refined for 30 years—codebase, patterns, optimized decisions.
>
> We take on select external projects too. Client work and partnerships fund the mission and keep the foundation battle-tested.
>
> You build on something real. We keep getting better. Good deal for everyone."

### Attempt 5: The Warm Invite
> "We've spent 30 years building a codebase—a foundation for software that scales without the usual friction.
>
> We use it for our own ventures. And we work with select clients and partners who want to build on that same foundation.
>
> It's how we fund the mission and keep the foundation sharp. It's how you skip years of hard lessons."

## The Cocktail Party Versions

**Version A:**
> "I run a venture studio. We build software on a codebase we've refined for 30 years. We also take on client projects and partnerships—keeps the foundation battle-tested, funds the bigger mission."

**Version B:**
> "We build software products on a foundation that took 30 years to get right. Sometimes for ourselves, sometimes with clients and partners. Experience × AI—compounded."

**Version C:**
> "Venture studio. Thirty years of engineering in a codebase. We build on it, and we build with people who want that foundation under their project."

---

## The Problem + Solution Flow

**Problem:**
> "Most software starts from scratch. Every project re-learns the same lessons, makes the same mistakes, hits the same walls."

**Insight:**
> "We've been stacking good decisions for 30 years. Not just experience—a living codebase. Foundation that compounds."

**Solution:**
> "We build our ventures on it. We also work with select clients and partners who want that head start."

**Outcome:**
> "You skip the hard lessons. We keep the foundation sharp. Experience × AI, working for both of us."

## PEACE Framework v4

| | Soundbite |
|---|-----------|
| **P** | "Most software starts from scratch. Same lessons. Same mistakes. Same walls." |
| **E** | "We've been there—three startups, decades of consulting. We know what breaks and when." |
| **A** | "So we built a foundation. Thirty years of decisions, compounded into a codebase. Experience × AI." |
| **C** | "We build our ventures on it. We also work with clients and partners who want that foundation." |
| **E** | "You skip years of hard lessons. We keep the codebase battle-tested. Everybody gets better." |

## Tagline Check

**"Experience × AI"** still works as the core multiplier.

Supporting phrases:
- "30 years, compounded"
- "The foundation that builds faster"
- "Venture studio. Battle-tested codebase. Select partnerships."
- "We build on it. You can too."

---

## One-Liner Options

**Full:**
> "Wilde Agency is a venture studio built on a 30-year codebase. We build our own products and work with select clients and partners—projects that fund the mission and exercise the foundation. Experience × AI."

**Medium:**
> "A venture studio with a 30-year foundation. We build on it. Select clients and partners do too."

**Short:**
> "30 years of engineering. Compounded. We build on it—and we build with you."

## Tone Check

| Old (Abrasive) | New (Inviting) |
|----------------|----------------|
| "We rarely take outside projects" | "We work with select clients and partners" |
| "Occasionally we open the door" | "Client projects fund the mission and exercise the foundation" |
| "You're not hiring us—we're choosing you" | "You get a head start. We get a stronger codebase." |
| "Rare access" | "Select partnerships" |
| "The right projects get in" | "We build with people who want this foundation" |

## What's Working?

- Flywheel framing (mutual benefit)
- "Exercise the foundation" (honest, practical)
- "Skip years of hard lessons" (clear value)
- "Everybody gets better" (aligned incentives)

## What to Push On?

- Is "select" still too exclusive?
- Does "client or partner" need more distinction?
- Is the 30 years specific enough, or does it need proof points?
