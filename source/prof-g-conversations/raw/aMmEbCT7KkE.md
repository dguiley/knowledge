thesis my fear is that this is going to help the president get elected that the majority of the voting public will see this as basically about sex and that this will be further play into the whole Narrative of the deep state is coming after me I think it's going to take a few weeks to a month to understand that but I actually am less pessimistic about it than you [Music] are Jess where did this podcast find you uh at home in New York City in the middle of my maternity leave so I'm thrilled to talk to an adult about something maternity leave oh my gosh how long is that I I am entitled to 16 weeks paid maternity leave good for you um that's a whole talk yes it is I would love to do a child care conversation for sure but by the way does your husband get paternity leave he does they don't have a formal policy it's just kind of like a take what you need situation and I still cuz he works in finance I still think that they are a little uneasy with taking a lot of time but people seem to be splitting it up like they take a bit at the beginning and then when they really want to be off like in August they're like oh you know I'm on fraternity leave so it's kind of a a mix bag did you take time with yours uh so just so you know so I've always had my own businesses um but that take as much as you need is a trick I used to do the same thing I used to tell people people say say what's your vacation policy and I'm like you need a vacation take a vacation and people in a you know a high achiever firm all feel this implicit pressure to take no time so I found it was the perfect model to make sure that no one took any time how's that from being a terrible boss I mean it's honestly how you keep up but again it's a a whole other story but I lived I think you know yeah well we've talked about it when I lived in London I did an internship for someone who was doing a maternity cover which can be up to a year over there and then the woman came back they didn't want to get rid of the guy who had subbed in and had done such a fantastic job and in the end the woman ended up getting pushed out a couple years later because there really wasn't a role for her left but they legally couldn't let her come not come back after a year off and it it turned into this whole mess of a thing so they they big politics with it to say the least kids ruin kids ruin everything all right let's get to the serious stuff here so 34 felony counts what do you make of this historic verdict well it seems like it was the correct verdict and everyone has really been parsing the difference between the jur what the jury did and whether this was politically motivated or if this was the right thing to bring the case it seems like the jury did a fantastic job they evaluated the evidence they went they made a timely decision I was following really closely at least on social media all the questions that they were asking all of the legal commentators kept saying those are the right questions to be asking paid great attention Etc and Todd blanch Donald Trump's lawyer went and did a bunch of interviews and he said you know we expected that this could happen we made all of our decisions together about how to present our case we obviously approved the jurors and the alternates and this is the way that it goes sometimes we'll see how the appeal process goes the other side of the coin which is should Alvin brag have brought this case and I I was listening to your latest episode of pivot uh before we got on so I know that you had Ellie hon gone who obviously has a bit of a a counter opinion to a lot of Democrats who are seething about even mentioning the fact that this was a case that perhaps should not have been brought and that bringing it up to a a federal charge with the campaign Finance fraud essentially was not the right way to go is the other side of the coin and that's where I think the really interesting stuff is well let's let's put forward that thesis my fear is that this is going to help the president get elected that this that the majority of the voting public will see this as basically about sex and that if they figured out a way to elevate uh an attempt to cover up sex or hush money to a felony that they're going to need more courts that there are a lot of people who pay off Mistresses or end up doing things that are illegal under the context of trying to to keep um Affairs discreet or quiet and that this is selective prosecution and that this will be further play into the whole Narrative of the deep state is coming after me rally his base my understanding is he raised a record amount of money or a lot of money post the verdict distinct of the merits of when you bring a case or don't just strategically if you don't want Trump to be president do you think this helps or hurts us I think it's going to take a few weeks to a month to understand that and the polling is really fuzzy at this moment and some people are just ingesting the information some people aren even paid attention to it yet and the Biden campaign is still figuring out how they want to approach this like how often do you want to call him Donald Trump and how often do you want to call him convicted felon Donald Trump um and that's something that the communications people are struggling with as we speak but I actually am less pessimistic about it than you are and the reason for that is that I only care about a small subset of Voters the bases of the parties don't matter to me at this point and I know that Biden's polling has been soft or softer with African-Americans and Latino voters and some young voters but that happened in 2020 as well and people came home so I I'm putting that to the side now and thinking okay who is my focus moderate Republicans and independent voters and there have been a few surveys taken since the verdict and we'll get more and more but ABC ifsu uh was out there in the field and they got that 52% of Independence say that he should withdraw from the race and 16% of Republicans 16% might seem like a low number but there's your swung election right those are your swing States potentially morning consult got basically a mirror image of that result uh CBS also something similar so if you think about how many people are actually up for grabs how few we have to persuade that this matters and that this isn't just a oneoff that he lied about this but that he is a chronic liar and that has been a thread through the egene Caroll case the Civil fraud case and if we ever get to the Marquee cases which obviously I would have preferred if we were talking about the nuclear secrets that are hanging out in the toilet at maral Lago or January 6th before we were talking about the hush money case I think that you can persuade a lot of people with that to just say you know what maybe I was thinking about giving him another shot but the guy is such an effing liar you work with I mean you work at a con or you work with a conservative networker what is what is the vibe when you talk to people off off camera are they are they do they generally believe this is another example of the deep State going after you know as a function of trump derangement syndrome or they this is bad for us what what's the vibe off mic or off camera among conservatives I think that they actually feel both of those things and that we're always trying to put people into one box and it's actually a lot more complex than that so yes the Deep state is real and they'll go back and try to relitigate quote Russia gate with me and then I'll get all hot and bothered again about Hillary Clinton and they'll be like actually I don't want to talk to you about this anymore um and then they also understand the fact that this does not help their case and you can tell that Republicans know that it's a bad thing from the type of panic and the way that they're speaking about him being a convicted felon a they want to raise a ton of money which they did I mean we'll see what the actual figures are but they're reporting $141 million which is astronomical they will not say what it will be used for which I'm always paying attention to so okay you've got all this money now are you going to open a field office and then they're like actually maybe we'll just pay Donald Trump's legal fees so that's some where the Democrats still have a huge Advantage um but they know that this isn't helpful no one ever wants to be indicted no one ever wants to be convicted and something that I don't think folks are paying as much attention to as they should be every day that Donald Trump is out there just grievances you know wall toall I'm a political prisoner whatever else he's talking about he's not talking about the issues and the issues are the ones that are going to sway that little group of people that we were talking about The Independents and the Republicans who have decided either he is this guy and we don't care or he is this guy and I'd like to hear something a plan for the economy a plan for the Border um so I I think that that does lead to an advantage for the Democrats and disappointment for my wonderful colleagues who I look forward to rejoining um in Milwaukee in July which is a crazy first week back that's going to be really interesting the convention right that's I'm actually a little scared you know the I live right by the courthouse in Manhattan and it was remarkably lowkey I saw a few kind of and I wouldn't call them like parades but you know bunch of trump cars that had blue lives matter flags and now the upside down American flag cuz Samuel Lio is some sort of hero for uh quote not standing up to his wife who did that all by herself or whatever um but when Trump was coming in and out they drive with him but going to the convention four days after the sentencing I I think it could get a little wild um I'm not saying January 6 levels but you know you have to be ready for anything to happen especially if he's given jail time but that's so it's just some anecdotal evidence and I'm curious if you picked up on the same thing I find one of the most encouraging things or a signal and granted I'm looking for signals that this is this is going to help get Biden reelected but when I was living in Florida and delway Beach and right after the election there was a parade for a stop the steel parade and delway is actually kind of purplish SL blue but there is you go 3 miles Inland and it's it's deep red I could not get over the number of people and the passion around the stop to steal and they had a death set up information and you know just for fun I walked over and had them explain and these were people who were deeply committed and believed that the the election had been stolen I thought I'm just so out of touch with America and the passion they felt the number of people the when the case when that verdict came down I was encouraged at how what I'll call Little ageta G events or rage among the general populace was I see it as there's rage fatigue that people are starting to think you know what I'm still going to vote for him but I'm not going to I'm not going to store him the capital do you do you sense the same thing I mean that's the hope but we're also far out from the election I I think the vibe in October is going to be a lot more heightened on on both sides of this I was surprised that there weren't more lefties showing up at the courthouse to troll him right or stand outside of Trump Tower and the new Tiffy which is gorgeous um and and trying to do it that way so I think that we're just a bit too far out for it um but I think it will be less because people probably have learned a lesson or two from the number of January Sixers who have gotten pretty serious sentences um and the number of people who have been very forthcoming with their transition out of being a trump supporter and talking about how they were manipulated how they were brainwashed how they fed him a bunch of lies and my hope is that Democrats will be able to connect what he's saying about this Alvin Brad case to the supposition that Donald Trump lies to you at every single turn Fox is um doing some really cool new polling work they have a new issues tracker and they also have this deal breaker question which I think is so awesome like what are the deal breaker issues for you number one was abortion I think Democrats need to get back to talking about preserving female reprodu rights that that's something that's always going to win for them but on the issues tracker Biden has a 15-point advantage on honesty and trustworthiness and I don't think they're leaning into it enough so before you became kind of a household name you were a consultant around messaging so I want you to do sort of um kind of armchair Consulting uh we're the Republican party what is our messaging around this issue moving forward I think that you've really got to split it up and you got to pick your best voice that are going to be out there kind of parting what Donald Trump wants to hear so it seems like JD Vance Marco Rubio are taking the mantle for that they're both high up in the VP search I think JD Vance is probably um ahead of Rubio in that and let them you know people who are respected as being intelligent folks uh talk about it and the rest of the party really has got to get back to talking about the issues I saw how Larry Hogan was totally maligned for saying something pretty normal like just respect the jury decision he didn't even say what he thought about Donald Trump even though we all know what it is that he thinks um and people like Kevin McCarthy who has found some courage since he has been out of office was on Fox talking about it and said you know what are we doing going after Larry Hogan that might be our chance to actually win a senate majority and whatever Donald Trump wants to talk about it doesn't change the fact that there is an election where people are going to turn up and they're going to vote on the economy you know crime and policing abortion for sure and if the only message coming out of the Republican party is Donald Trump is a victim when everyone can see that that's not really what a victim looks like it's not going to go well what now do Democrats what do you think the messaging do you think they play up President Biden's positives as you reference or do you think they get they go on offense and start calling this guy a felon I mean the risk is it makes President Biden look less presidential less bipartisan less statesmanlike it lowers the contract between him and Trump because we know what Trump will do do you do you go on offense or do you try and maintain a Statesman like demeanor well I think this is where you can separate Biden from his surrogates and he has some fantastic surrogates who need to be out there more I mean John fedman has become the darling right of the party he went from vegetable to can we get this guy to come to my rally um and Republican saying to me I had a very funny offir conversation with a colleague who was like I like John fedman that what is that and I was like yeah you know maybe you shouldn't have been so shitty about him um he's actually kind of always been that way you just didn't ask him about Israel so yeah well he's but that isn't that he threads the needle right totally he throws a bone to the Republicans by saying I'm unapologetically pro-israel but this guy's a crook yeah and he doesn't think about it that way that's the thing about John fedman is he doesn't have the vibe of anyone who is calculating what they're saying and you can say that even look at his outfit right no one picked that out right no one said this is coordinated um and he just speaks from the heart and I think that that's something that's really resonating with folks and you see it with Gretchen Whitmer as well Josh Shapiro Wes Moore is becoming a superstar this way so I think that those folks can be out there threading the needle and Biden has dabbled in the in the convicted felon jargon a little but in general I want to see more of the interviews like he's on the cover of time that came out this morning I want to see more of that him talking about the policy issues what he's actually done in the Middle East he's he's pretty critical of Netanyahu actually um which is something that I think will not only appease the left side of the party but a lot of the people like me who are pretty moderate in the middle you know want Israel to do everything that they possibly can to get the hostages back and to bring peace but to recognize that Netanyahu is a bad actor and all of that so I think Biden you know stays a Statesman um but he Unleashed es the Beast underneath that and makes sure that every one of those getable voters knows what the alternative is and that they also are aware of the fact that if they sit it out if they were a Nikki Haley voter or Chris Christie voter that that is another vote for Trump he brought up a key word it's something I've been thinking about a lot surrogates and I'm disappointed that he hasn't weaponized more surrogates I don't see mayor Pete out there I don't see John fedman wasn't plannned I don't I don't think surpr and it strikes me that there are 50 or 100 incredible surrogates that could be out there you know Governor Newsome is really good on his feed I I would argue that he might be a better candidate than an actual politician but it strikes me why have they not you know put these people in so to speak you know put me in coach why have they not weaponized them and also one thing I'm disappointed at is that typically the person that goes on the attack is the vice president and why why has that not is it is it because they don't see her as effective is it because she is in fact ineffective and also what where's the weaponization and the surrogate strategy here yeah so I we are still early in campaign mode and I think that the fact that they moved up the debate puts them further on their heels right like you've got to go faster if you've decided that you want to have a debate June 27th um so we've got to see that KLA Harris is it's been tough right and we talked about the last time um that you had me on you know she has not panned out as the superstar that a lot of Democrats hop that she would be I was personally not a tremendous comma fan in the primary and I think it said something that she dropped out before Iowa right she didn't even get the opportunity to have a vote cast for her um and the Democratic base was sending a signal that she wasn't what they thought she was or what they had hoped that she was going to be so I think there's a little bit of anxiety about that and I think that also she is to give her credit doing well talking to younger bases she's doing a huge amount of college tours for instance and we know that the turn out in these college tones especially in conservative States you know you hear about a conservative State and then suddenly there was this boom turnout for a referendum on women's Reproductive Rights and it's like oh is there a big college town in there um so she's doing that and also I think that she is the best representative of the administration unsurprisingly to talk about women's health and she's been doing that really well so that's really been her Focus but I think that she has to get in on this especially with her law enforcement background she was the top cop right in California and I think you know if we want to get away from to fund the police which I wish had never happened and move more towards We're the Party of Law and Order and we can make that claim now right they don't respect any judicial decisions at this point they think the Supreme Court is on tap for them you know Mike Johnson out there saying like you know I I think they'll step in I I called my buddies over there and uh they'll do something uh that she has a real role to play the surate strategy it'll be rolled out as the campaign gets going but I would love to see it more and I'm hugely enthusiastic about Democrats showing up especially in conservative media that's where the persuadable voters are they're not watching MSNBC they're not watching CNN um so they're tuning into Vox and when Pete mayor Pete comes on I still can't call him sec AR Pete it just feels unnatural uh when he comes on he does great um yeah he does great so I I'm with you on that same with Governor Nome right it's interesting that you said that though he so Charming yeah he's very likable he's very likable um I remember 25 years ago I was in San Francisco and I was thinking I filled out the paperwork to run for supervisor and I brought my friend and we met then I think supervisor Nome and we talked to him for about 2 minutes and then he walked away and then me and my friend looked at each other I'm like I have no chance if that's the competition there's just my career is over before it started you meet that guy and you're like I'm not even sure what he's saying I just know I want him to be I want to vote for him or give him money what do you what do you make of you just said something very interesting that you think there's more uh that there's more influenceable or more moderate or more swingable voters watching Fox I can see I agree that MSNBC but you think that more moderates watch Fox in CNN yeah well the neelon data actually Bears it out um so we have more Democrats and more Independents um who are by Nature the persuadables right because they're not going with one way or the other I tend to think a social issue usually pushes you into one bucket and now it's abortion um but yeah the numbers bear that out and also like CNN's ratings and I love a lot of the people at CNN and I think there's a lot of really good commentary but they just don't get many viewers technically so the percentages of persuad has to be even less and obviously they're going through you know a bit of an identity crisis and I think they have some amazing people who are now anchoring big shows like the Caitlyn collinses of the world and Abby Phillip um but they're searching for their base and fox has a conservative base but we also have this persuadable base um and they're the people most apt to reach out to me right it will say you know I may lean towards Jesse waters's perspective or Greg gutfeld's perspective Ive these people on the five with me um but I really appreciate your fact-based commentary or that you always come to represent the Democratic side in a reasonable way and that's the key to all of this just be reasonable you know don't be unhinged and right now the Republicans look unhinged so before we let before we cut you loose here just handicap or give us your best guess or prediction on what you think uh going back to Trump happens with sentencing so I'm not a lawyer um and it's a tough one I've tried to ingest as much information about this as possible uh I I do come down on the side of that there will be a recommendation for jail time but I was listening to pre bahar's pod podcast and he had a really interesting suggestion for Alvin brag which was to show the judge how this particular crime had been sentenced The Last 5 Years for instance to say these are the sentences that have been given out before and then to put it more in judge meron's Court um than to make the straight recommendation um but I do you know I don't expect any serving of time if he's if he's sentenced to jail and he's elected and then certainly it would be after the election they're not going to stop him from running his campaign um but I think it's over 50% uh likelihood and a lot of people who you know work in the system and know the players in this really well think that that is the expectation which is absolutely unbelievable I thought if anything The Fulton County case was going to be the jail case um that we would be hearing about but we're not even going to see that this year odds are well it feels as if Trump is daring the judge to sends him to prison and I found that is not typically a good strategy for convicted fance no it's not um and I don't think that he's going to like the result of it I mean it's a famous he's famous German phobe uh prison is not nice even if you get uh the best treatment if even if you're a Danbury playing tennis uh you know a couple times a day so I I think that he needs to be really careful about what he wishes for and what he thinks is going to become an electoral Advantage they clearly think that there's you know some possibility that he's going to be you know like a civil rights leader in all of this and we could spend hours discussing how offensive it is that he thinks that black people are going to like him more now that this has happened uh to him but you know be careful what you wish for cuz the other side of it isn't just like a a night at home alone eating pizza it's being in jail Jessica tarlo is a co-host on the five Fox week night news program she also offers political analysis across Fox Business Network or fbm uh Jessica is also the vice president of research and consumer insight for Buell digital group she joins us from her home in New York where she is
