# Habit Stacking

> Attach a new habit to an existing one to leverage existing neural pathways.

## When to Use

- Adding a new habit to your routine
- Struggling to remember a new behavior
- Want to build compound habits over time

## Process

1. **Identify anchor habit**: Something you already do consistently
2. **Define new habit**: Be specific about what and where
3. **Create stack statement**: "After I [ANCHOR], I will [NEW HABIT]"
4. **Start small**: The new habit should take <2 minutes initially

## Examples

```
After I pour my morning coffee, I will write one journal sentence.
After I sit at my desk, I will review my task list.
After I close my laptop, I will put one thing away.
```

## Why It Works

Existing habits have strong cue-response pathways. By linking to them, you borrow their trigger reliability instead of building a new cue from scratch.

## Appendix

### A. Source

James Clear's Atomic Habits framework. The Cue-Craving-Response-Reward loop explains why stacking works - you're inserting into an existing cue.

> "Habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that guide your future behavior."

### B. Variations

- **Habit chain**: Stack multiple small habits in sequence
- **Temptation bundling**: Pair a habit you need to do with one you want to do
