# Those MCP totally 10x my Cursor workflow

Published: 2025-02-21

I've been playing with mCP integration into AI coding IDE for the past few days it has totally changed my workflow and boost my productivity so my cursor not only generate codes but also calling text to image model to generate all the gaming assets that is needed for developing the game that you're seeing here and not only that when there bugs my cursor also looking to console log and network request to debug Arrow it can even read my superbase database directly and doing internet search looking to my figma file all those thanks to the mCP server function so today I will take you through what is mCP how can you integrate existing mcps that other people already created as well as the easiest way to set up your own mCP server in just few minutes for people who are watching this video you probably more or less heard about mCP which is a modo context protocol introduced by entropic last year it basically provide a universal interface for people to connect their agent to allour different data source and external systems you can think of mCP like a USBC port for all sorts of different air applications just like USBC provides standardized way to connect your device to also different accessories mCP provides standardized ways to connect AI model to different data source and external system what's really interesting is AI coding has evolved a lot for the past few months from initially just a chat co-pilot to composer that can create a fil to nowadays all the modern a ID like cursor and window server or build powerful agents that can do some plannings and take a lot of different type of actions at default cursor coding agents we have a list of actions that can take but what if you wanted to do more that's where the mCP comes in you can build all sorts of different COs in inations so that cursor can access almost whatever you want they really change the game for AI codings mCP can be used for many different scenarios for example some of mCP server might be just prompts where the agent can just call certain mCP like analyze code and it will return a proper user message with specific prompt that can guide the agent behavior for next actions but on the outs side mCP can also be used to connect to different external Resource as well as assistance to calling different API and point when you look at entropic mCP doc it is fairly complicated and not exactly clear how can you install and create your own mCP very easily that's why today I want to take you through some of my favorite mCP as well as the easiest way to build your own mCP that can connect your cursor into any source of system you want so without further Ado let's get it there are a few Marketplace already existed they show you a list of mCP that other people have created that you can use from gl. a SMI cursor. directory as well ASM systems where they have hosted mCP server that you can use and the way you can use those platform is that you can search for the mcpu that you want to use for example if I I want to add a sequential thinking mCP which is type of mCP that will force agent to think through a few different steps and do some plannings I can choose a ID that I'm using in this case a recursor and I can just copy this command line over go to my cursor select feature and in the mCP server I can click on ADD mCP I can give a name and the name here didn't really matter I can just call it sequential thinking and there are two different types you can choose in most cases for now you'll probably choose command which means it will run a local command to call the server but if you're using some host mCP server then you can choose SS but most of the time it is almost always command so we can add this and click add the botton you will see that this is a new mCP server added called sequential syncing and this is one two called sequential sying so what I can do is that we can start a new chat with agent and just give a prompt I want to build a game now let's plan it using sequential syncing don't generate any code yet and then you will be prompt to call this mCP server and for this specific tool if you open it you can see that it is basically trying to use function call to force agent generate multiple different sorts it is counting how many sorts that you need to do in total and the next s needed will be true which means if I finish this it will try to continue doing another s repeat this process for probably eight times if you want you can also turn on this YOLO mode which means you don't need to approve every single time but I would suggest you to do the manual one first but to make something more interesting you can also search for a r mCP and one thing to not is that currently there's no standardized way to install or set up mcps each mCP is kind of set up differently and the quality of mcps on those websites are also quite unstable many of them didn't really work at all and this makes adoption a lot harder but I will show you a few example of common ways to install those mcps basic I want to find command line to use sometimes they will provide MPX package D which you can copy and start using but quite often you will have problem that it didn't really work for example if I copy this one and add a mCP server Reddit MC you might see that this mCP has no tool available which means you can't do anything with it but you might also say Json like this and for this one you basically need to convert them into a single line command which in this case will be the uvx from git link here mCP Reddit and you can of separate them out with space so I can copy this and add a new server called it redit command and paste in you can see that this has been added with two tools fetch Reddit hot strats and fetch Reddit post content and we can give a try what are some latest hot content on Reddit it will try to call this mcp2 F Reddit hot Strat and if I click accept you can see it return some of the content from reddits so this is basically how you can use those existing platform to find mCP that you might be able to use but one really annoying thing of using other people's mCP at the moment is that even though there are mCP directories many of those mcps didn't actually work or it is very complicated to set up with incomplete documents I spent quite a lot of time testing different mcps and future down list of mcps that's both useful and useable I'll share this list in the AI Builder Club Community and building and I'll continue sharing new interesting mCP I found so if you're interested you can click on the link below to join my community but what I want to show you is a few MC that I personally use a lot that really boost my productivity and the first mCP I want to introduce is browser tools this mCP that give your cursor access to your browser console log and network tabs directly so that they can run your app debugging much easier and also allow you to communicate with cursor about specific element that you want to change on the you firstly you will need to clone their Chrome plugin so you can either run the command line get clone or you can use GitHub desktop app and clone this specific Ripple and once it's done you can click on the settings in your Chrome extension and click on load on compact then choose Chrome extension folder from the browser 2 mCP folder as you see the browser 2 mCP show up here and next we want to add mCP server to cursor you click on settings feature mCP server and just give a name browser tools and the type we choose command here we're need to copy this and paste in you can see it has list of tools from get console logs console Arrow Network Arrow screenshots as well as select element and the last step is that we want to run the browser to mCP server so you can just open Terminal in any directory to MP X at agentes browser to server and then this server is running now if you go to any web page and open inspector you can see at top there have bar called browser 2 mCP is debugging the browser which means you can actually go to cursor in agent mode just ask what's in my console lck and it will run this get console log to it'll be able to see all the console logs you have and also check if there's any arrow in console L apart from reading the console and network logs it also has cool features like guest L Elements which means you can go to your web browser right click in back so in here we select this specific element and then I can give prompt update only the style of element I choose in the browser right now to something fancier that looks like a real poket car then it will run this function called guest L element and return a specific diff and from there it identify it is car component and update that specific component and this is kind of fairly simple example but you can imagine for more complex applications this will allow you to communicate with cursor much easier and one of the coolest thing that mCP allow you to do is connect to any other service to enhance your cursor workflow for example what if cursor can call text to image model to generate all sorts of gaming assets like the background image and this is where you can create custom mCP server to connect any sort of service and here you can see I actually create my own mCP server with one of function called generate image so what I would do is I take a screenshot of how the game looks like right now help me generate different images of dogs for cards instead of emoji and click submit and then it will call this function to generate a image and it will return one and it will try to generate a few more all right so it generate a few different image so we have this new game called poy memory game and if you click on each one of them you can see that they are unique image that generated by the AI model and all those image are actually coordinated by cursor itself which is absolutely amazing and even though setting up mCP server does sounds like a lot of work when you look at mCP doc but it's actually not that complicated and you can use cloud flat where they provide a worker and mCP that basically give you the boy play of the mCP server you just need to build function yourself and I'm going to quickly show you how you can do that so I'm going to create a new folder with command line mpm create Cloud flare at latest so this one we set up a cloud flare project I will just name it my mCP and the example I will choose hell word and Hell World worker and language I will choose typescript and do we want to use git for the version of course we want and do we want to deploy for this one I'm going to choose use no but if you want you can also deploy it to use on other server or even share with others later cool the next step is our CD my mCP which is folder name and then do mpm so you can just paste this in if you restart Cloud you should be able to see a little toy icon show up here where it include all the functions that we have defined in those example file but if you want to activate this mCP for cursor what you will do is that you will put the command of this one space this one and this one and putting that together for my specific examp example I would just put this command line into cursor's mCP so I can add a new mCP and my mCP type will be command and paste that in and add you can see this tool has been added successfully and here is one tool called say hello if you open your mCP folder and select indexs this as we mentioned before is where you're going to store all the functions so here you can see this one function called say hello so the thing above is how we communicate when to use this tool the inputs and expand output format and here we have one function of say hello so what we can do is that we can open cursor or just say say hello for workers mCP server for me and now you can see it tried to call this tool called say hello and it return this result which is what you define here this is a very basic mCP function but you can imagine now you can write whatever function you want conect to external API service or even run local models directly and this is exactly how I write mCP to call image generation model post down replicate I can just choose the API service I can just copy the code example open cursor paste in and give prom help me write a new function that will generate image using a model host down replicate don't use any environment variable just put variable inside index.ts directly uh so this is not best practice but because cursor mCP unfortunately didn't allow you to set up environment variable very easily so we have to set the environment variable inside the file direct lay and I will also give some additional prompt the replicate API return a prediction object that needs to be pulled for completion not an immediate result and making sure pass result poply so this just some a common mistake I saw L model often make with replicate API aut box okay I'll click accept and at top we need to put the API key here and here you can see that it generate new function with description generate image using recraft V3 model and with two input param prompt and size and return the URL of gener image once it's finished I do PM round deploy this word deploys again and just for testing purpose I will use cloud to just quickly test it so I will close cloud and open Cloud again just quickly check the generate image is here so I say help me generate an image of Doc Val AI allow for this chat and I got an arrow saying fail to start image generation the specific version didn't exist I think it is using the wrong URL for some reason so I'm just going to copy this in again make sure you use the right URL and write inputs just like above code example okay once it's finished we can do npm R deploy to deploy the latest version and I'm going to restart Cloud to say help me generate a dog image well the reason I use cloud is because I don't want to keep restart my cursor it's just a bit easier but you don't have to you can also just testing cursor directly okay so you can see that it return this message of the image URL generated if I open that link it will show me this image generation so this how you can connect any sorts of functionalities and external assistant to your cursor I'm really excited to see what kind of things you're going to come up with and most annoying thing about mCP now is that many of them just kind of don't work out of box it's almost easier to build your own so I spent quite a few time to like test different mCP server choose the ones that I use a lot and I'm putting the AI build club and building so if you're interested you can click on the link below to join the community where I will be maintaining a list of high quality mCP that I found is extremely useful for AI coding as well as some custom ones that I develop myself you can click the link in the description below to join my community I hope you enjoy this content if you enjoy please comment below I'll post more in depth tutorial about mcps in AI coding thank you and I see you next time
