what is the one or two things you would want to do to set up a context of success and addiction avoidance because we are creatures innately designed to approach pleasure and avoid pain we need to create spaces where we have access to healthy sources of pleasure and an sufficient challenge to make that interesting enough for us that we creatures who need a certain degree of friction find it interesting and also spaces that um limit our access to unhealthy sources of pleasure unhealthy DOP [Music] mean Dr lumy where does this podcast find you I am physically sitting in my office here at Stanford University this is where I treat patients and do my work let's bust right into it in your bestselling book dopamine Nation published back in 2021 you argued that constant access to stimulation is rewiring our brains four years later has anything changed or any additional observations between then and now I would say that the four years that have elapsed have really unfortunately just seen an acceleration uh in this problem I guess the good news is that people are talking about it more more aware of it um I think the ground swell really started with parents concerned about their kids but I think in general um the average person is now you know more aware of and concerned about their consumption of digital media something that I'm especially concerned about as the father of a 14 and 17y old especially with a 14y old and my colleague Jonathan he talks a lot about this is that the rewiring is especially or I guess the more appropriate term would be the wiring of the brain is children are going through puberty that that can be especially damaging are we are we about to flush into the economy or Society millions of essentially dopa addicts that if they don't find it on their screen they're going to find it elsewhere yeah it's a great question I think it's important to emphasize that we are constantly rewiring our brains wiring just really being a metaphor for neurons and the plasticity of neurons and the way that we're constantly making new connections between neurons every single experience that we have rewires our brain in some way um so you know the fact that we're spending enormous amounts of Time online by the latest report I think it was Pew surveys came out and said that 50 about 50% of teenagers now report being continuously online during the waking hours of course that is rewiring our brain the question is to what end right because we have to adapt to any environment we're always rewiring our brains but are we now rewiring our brains in a way that is ultimately not good for us as individuals not good for society it's not good for Humanity and I mean I would say I think I'm a little bit more measured than Jonathan height about this although I totally respect him in his work I would say yes there is a lot to be concerned about here um but that I'm ultimately optimistic that we will both self and other regulate what do I mean by that I'm already seeing people who are beginning to say you know what this isn't good for me or this isn't good for my family even teenagers themselves forming these groups and saying let's get off social media together let's try to do things that we can do in real life you know with each other um other regulate because it can't just be left up to the individual this is far too powerful a transformation to just say well you know it's up to you to figure out how to moderate your consumption of digital media we have to get smartphones out of schools bell to Bell we have to hold the company's accountable we have to legislate particularly to protect kids talk about the different types of addiction there's obviously addiction to screen and there's drugs there's alcohol there's pornography there's gaming what is there any way to sort of Stack rank these addictions and I was always told I'm pretty open on my podcast I love marijuana I loved it in college I took kind of a 20-y year break because I was working my ass off now I've started using it again and I enjoy it and I actually think it's added to my life and but I remember people was telling me that it was a gateway drug to more serious addictions if you were to sort of Stack rank different types of addictions in terms of what is the most dangerous or what perhaps is a gateway to other things any thoughts about sort of the hierarchy or the waterfall of different types of addiction I have become pretty much convinced over the course of my career that it depends on the person and their unique wiring and their drug of choice uh for one given individual traditional drugs like alcohol cannabis opioids nicotine may not hold much appeal but social media May indeed be the drug that overpowers them um and leads to a very serious and devastating addiction furthermore uh there are people are variably vulnerable to addiction period you know some people are much more vulnerable than others and can get addicted to a lot of different substances and behaviors other people you know getting addicted is something that probably won't happen to them to a significant degree and again the uniqueness of the wiring although I have argued that we're all more vulnerable to addiction now than before because of the drug ification of our environment I think we also have to take into consideration that when we're thinking broadly about danger it's not just the addictiveness of the drug like nicotine is very addictive for many people um but also The lethality of the drug so opioids is something that can kill when even when the dose is just a little bit beyond what the dose is for the desired effect that's not true in the short term for nicotine or cannabis right which can do significant harm in people who are addicted and use heavily but it usually takes a long time many many years of exposure you know in in your case um you know somebody who loves marijuana who gave it up for a period of Time Is Now using it and just basically finds it enjoyable you know great um it's nice if that can be an enjoyable part of a person's life intoxicants in various forms have been around since the beginning of time the one thing that I would caution about always is just that we're not always the best self- observers around whether or not our enjoyment is really leading us to our short-term enjoyment is is really leading to long-term enjoyment or uh is interfering you know in ways that we can't see just because these drugs tend to interfere with our Insight um in terms of what they're doing to us um and often they can be causing harm or we can be getting addicted and really not see it I've observed something and I'd love you to get I'd love to get your thoughts on it I go to a lot of conferences where there's a lot of of young successful people whether it's South by Southwest or I go to this event called Summit and I've noticed over the LA going to these events for the last 20 years that young people are not drinking and but it's not as if they've gone healthy or healthier they the aspirational set likes to think they've discovered a new technology and that they're innovators and now they're all doing ketamine not all a lot of them have substitute substituted or traded out alcohol for ketamine ecstasy SL Molly tusi which I guess is a mix of ketamine and Molly even to the point where they would roam around these conferences with their own concoction using eye droppers and different means of I mean it's just staggering to me I was on I went to this thing called Summit at Sea and it was on a cruise ship and I went up and ordered a drink and the bartender said Jesus someone's actually ordering a drink and this is amongst the doctor of wealthy young people who would generally there'd be a line at the bar and there oh and the one I Mi mixed was a Miss was mushroom chocolates and I imagine there's a lot of Edibles in there too I've just seen an enormous and if you look at it's having such weird KnockOn effects in London 40% of nightclubs have closed since pre pandemic because kids aren't drinking and some of that is they don't have the money anymore but they've swapped out they're under the impression that it's uh healthier or less bad for for you and they'd rather do mushroom chocolates and have one drink or Molly and they see alcohol as old technology I'm curious if you see if you know this is just anecdotal evidence or if you see real evidence of this and what your thoughts are around addiction and what it means for society when we're no longer two Martini lunches we're maybe doing a little bit of ketamine and trying to get on with our day what what do you see going on here yeah well I mean you know I'm really torn because on one level as an addiction psychiatrist I'm thrilled that people are taking more seriously the harms of alcohol um which we've known for you know many thousands of years of course again alcohol in moderation the healthiest people being those who drink no more than one to two standard drinks per week and the threshold being per week per week right per week so if we're taking the healthiest people on the planet oh do I I was almost entirely sure you were going to say for D okay maybe I know I know but let me qualify that let me qualify that um okay so that's a j-shaped curve that shows that people who drink one to two standard drinks per week are the healthiest but it's probably because there are confounds there like those are people who do a lot of things in moderation they eat in moderation they exercise in moderation um they're even healthier than people who don't drink at all but that's not because alcohol itself is good for us it's because in that non-drinking cohort you get people who are what we call sick quitters who used to drink heavily and now are on the liver transplant list but what we do know is that Beyond two drinks per week and again these are large epidemiologic catchment studies one given individual is going to have their own trajectory but you know Beyond two drinks a week you get to thresholding women wear more than seven drinks per week and men men more than 14 drinks per week where you start to see a significant increase in all cause morbidity and mortality whether it's risk of cancer risk of accidental death or trauma risk of pancreatitis liver disease you know dementia what have you so that's why we generally recommend that men have no more than 14 standard drinks per week and no more than four on a given occasion when women no more than seven per week and no more than three on a given occasion um but in general through most of my career it's been an uphill battle trying to convince people that alcohol is not good for them when consumed in excess excess being as we just as I just defined it with the 1404 there's been a huge sea change in the last five years where all of a sudden people seem much more aware of the dangers of alcohol much less inclined to consume it recreationally because they're concerned with the dangers this Maps perfectly with what we know about perceived dangers in use when people perceive that substance is dangerous they're less likely to use it less likely to use it in excess less likely to get addicted the huge shift along with that I think is twofold one what you've already identified the incredible surgence of designer drugs and all their various forms including plant medicines hallucinogens psychedelics where people really misperceive the dangers think they're much safer than they actually are and also have become equated with having some kind of actualized experience or spiritual growth experience so you've got the combination of people thinking they're not dangerous why because they've been heavily promoted as not dangerous including the studies that promote their use for example the use of psilocybin as a treatment for depression those studies systematically ignore harms don't document harms so and the lay press has picked that up that has legs and now people think oh you know hallucinogen psychedelics they're not addictive they're not harmful and might have a spiritual awakening so so that's what's happening there I think the other piece of it too that can't be ignored is that we are narcotizing ourselves with digital media so where we might go drink and get together with others which in some sense at least it was more social you know now you know I can speak for myself I'm like in my bedroom watching One YouTube video after another and it feels very pleasant um and yet I know it's not good for me we'll be right back support for the the show comes from betterment when investing your money starts to feel like a second job betterment steps in with a little work life

interesting for me because I get to like you know there go see a real human being and I have one of the top domain experts in the world so on yourself or on something I'm teasing you um on on addictions and I'm fascinated with addictions and I want to talk about a couple addictions I think I have and you talk about whether they're actually clinically diagnosed addictions and what to do about them and then I want to talk about the advice I give to young men and what I'm getting right and wrong because I what I realize is I have a series of principles that I lecture young men about and I don't know I think I'm right but I want to know what I don't know so the first is I believe that everyone has a certain amount of addictions so that's not true some more than others but I think almost everybody has some level of something they do that is probably if they did less it would probably be better for them across their life whether it's addictions to shopping the affirmation whatever it might be and I am addicted to the affirmation of strangers I care too much about what other people who I don't know will never know than and sometimes it gets in the way of my relationships with people who I do I should care about I someone will say something mean about me or insult my work on a social media platform and it inhibits my ability to be close to my loved ones that weekend I see that as an addiction an addiction to the affirmation of others and strangers and I think that might be something that plagues quite frankly a lot of successful people or insecure people and then I would also argue I have an addiction to money that I I'm very blessed and I got kind of enough money to live well or be economically secure and I still almost every waking hour spent a decent amount of that time thinking about how to get more money even when I should probably and I I talk myself into believing it's for me and my family but it's really just an addiction I've spent so long trying to dig out of economic insecurity that I've become addicted to more specifically more money so addiction to the affirmation of others addiction to money are those clinically diagnosed addictions and how should I be thinking about them wow those are really good ones that I don't get asked about very often um so thank you for your honest self disclosure let me go back a little bit to your first comment this idea that everybody has something that they do more of than they wish they did I mean and and that's been true since the beginning of time we know going all the way back to what Aristotle called wide eyed incontinence incontinence is actually something that we a term we use in medicine to to talk about when people can't hold their bladder but this kind of where Aristotle talked about wide-eyed incontinence I see the thing that I am doing I have wide eyes when I'm seeing it I want to stop doing as much of it as I'm doing and yet I am unable to and so I agree with you that that that is true for all of us in varing degrees and it's because of the way we are wired over you know many many many thousands of years of evolution to reflexively approach pleasure and avoid pain because that is what insur our survival in a world of scarcity and everpresent danger which is the world that we lived in for most of human existence as civilization has progressed we have managed to use our big brains to apply technology and right now we've drug aied everything we've made it more potently rewarding more easily accessible more abundant more novel and so now we're all struggling with this problem of compulsive overc consumption which is uh you know really making us unhappy this idea of the affirmation of strangers so it's very clear that we are also wired over Evolution to want to connect with people um you know being in a tribe is what ensures that we will find mates um Steward scarce resources protect ourselves against predators and that wiring Works through our dopamine reward pathway we know that oxytocin the love hormone binds to dopamine releasing neurons in the reward circuitry to release dopamine which is pleasure reward neurotransmitter the more that dopamine is released and the faster that it's released the better it feels and this is healthy and normal and wonderful until you have drug aied human connection which is exactly what the internet and social media and digital media has done so you're somebody who's relational you care about what other people think of you we all do by the way to varying degrees but you know most of us if not all of us care what other people think that's so deeply ingrained um but now you live in a world where you can have instant affirmation or its opposite at scale hundreds to thousands to millions of people right Quantified with likes and shares and and on and on and now you really have a very potent drug which when it's going well is incredibly reinforcing much more so than some nice compliment my husband might give me like that's not as exciting as my book is number one on Amazon right with a whole bunch of reviews and people telling me that I'm great um and it's very easy to get get caught up in that so yes I think we can get addicted to the affirmation of strangers I think that the internet and social media has become the drug ification of social affirmation making us all more vulnerable to that problem and my intervention for that problem would be the same as for people addicted to drugs and alcohol which would be to abstain from social affirmation venues especially when you're dealing with them at scale so try to avoid those types of situations uh where you would be exposed to like all of the love because ultimately what happens with that huge surch of dopamine is that our brain compensates by downregulating dopamine transmission not just to Tonic Baseline levels but actually below Baseline we go into a dopamine deficit state that is the addicted brain now we need more of our drug and more potent forms not to get high and feel good but just to sort of level our balance go back to Baseline and feel normal and we're in a constant state of craving plus we're experiencing the universal symptoms of withdrawal from any addictive substance which are anxiety irritability insomnia dysphoria and craving getting more of our drug temporarily relieves that but but it doesn't last very long and and actually makes the problem worse and in terms of money I mean there's so much evidence that monetary gain lights up the same reward pathway as drugs and alcohol um it's why we're seeing a huge huge increase in um online pathological gambling sports betting has been made legal in many states in the nation and with it like a 300 to 500% increase in calls to hotline pathological gambling centers because people are losing everything in the face of you know their their parlays um have to do with whether or not the referee is going to touch his hat five times you know during the game so yeah I mean this is sort of human nature like RIT large because we live in an ecosystem that has taken all of these things that are in some fundamental way healthy and good for us and something that our brains need to be doing and and turned it into a drug yeah part of thought I I believe that one of I'm constantly saying something as a crisis I over use the word crisis but I do think we have a crisis of loneliness do you think you can be addicted to loneliness or that we just fill in the dope that we used to get from being social to as you referenc getting that hit with a lowcost low entry lowrisk activity like YouTube or what have you can you get a I I have to force myself it takes me almost as much discipline to to get out and be around other people as it is to drink less I have become as I've gotten older addicted to to being alone and I just find it easier comforting whatever happens and I know it's bad for me could you say a certain level of deciding to be alone maybe more than it's healthy is could that be classified as an addiction drugs in all their forms are the great human replacement addiction is a disease of loneliness even if we have a lot of great people in our lives if we are if we get addicted we will isolate and we will use our drug to replace that human connection so and I say that because we sometimes talk about loneliness as the cause of addiction but more often than not what I see is that the addiction causes the loneliness that because we're able to use this drug or this device or this Behavior to meet our physical emotional sexual needs we are no longer seeking out other people and it's a it's an enormous problem because not only are more people in the United States actually physically living alone than ever before but more people than ever before are endorsing loneliness so this is a huge problem and again the antidote is to do the thing that's painful and difficult in the short term because in the long term uh it will make us feel better and it will make our lives better how have you seen the the patients and the research you see come through your office and across your desk which addictions or types of addictions have you seen increase and decrease so our the in terms of our patient population the most common addictions for years have been The Usual Suspects alcohol nicotine cannabis and then starting the early 2000s opioids prescription opioids segueing to heroin and elicit fentanyl starting in the early 2000s we saw the very first signal of uh typically middle-aged men coming in with sex pornography and compulsive masturbation addiction and almost universally endorsing that it was the Advent of the internet and then explicitly uh the mobile device the smartphones that led them from you know moderate manageable pornography use to uh immoderate unmanageable addictive use and and destroying lives and like losing their families their jobs engaging in illegal activity um um since that time we've just seen an increase in escalation in people coming presenting with um digital media addictions video games social media online gambling online shopping um the internet more broadly a kind of diffuse addiction to the Internet so that's what we're really seeing increasing um you know we're here in Northern California so cannabis is huge we're also seeing a lot of as we talked about sort of designer drugs psychedelics hallucinogens like nobody uses they used to call they used to like let's say 25 30 years ago they had this term White Glove alcoholics these were folks who like they were just addicted to alcohol and not anything else we never see that anymore um everybody's using a whole bunch of stuff uh it's real it's a real sort of poly Pharmacy Festival I coach and work with a lot of young people specifically I think a lot about young men and the addiction I see emerging that I don't think is getting enough attention that just feels like a ticking Time Bomb to me is online gambling and the reason I think of it as being so dangerous is my mother was a dosent at um the bage in Vegas and so she used to come home with all these facts about gambling addiction and she told me and you can confirm or deny this that it has the highest suicide rate because you can get in so deep if if I develop an addiction to meth or alcohol It generally becomes pretty visible to the people around me and they intervene and try to do something I can get so deep with gambling and nobody knows and then I get in so deep I spent my kids college fun mortgage the house my spouse doesn't know what I've done I see no way out and I decide to end it and I see I've just seen these stats that 50% of college males bet on the Super Bowl and I I see occasionally I'm in a scenario where I'm with a bunch of young men and they're all on their phones and I think oh that's natural people I know kids are on the phones they're all gambling on the game they're watching and they're not gam they're not doing a 100 bucks Liverpool will beat Arsenal they're gambling every seven minutes it's the the the the ball's going to turn over what you were saying about the ref and I and these I know these companies and the people architecting these algorithms they will figure out who's going to lose their money and encourage them to bet more and the ones who actually know what they're doing they will block out of the platform so it's a guaranteed loss of income so if and and I like to gamble I think it's fun I go to Vegas I gamble but I I assume it's consump I assume I'm going to lose it all it strikes me that we might and tell me if if I'm being just I don't know hyperbolic or inflammator or I don't know exaggerating or or or just you know woring too much here that we're going to have hundreds of thousands of young men in my sense as young men and again i' like you to validator and nfy this are much more prone to gambling addiction than women who enter the world with massive Financial hangovers and shame because of the constant presence of gambling apps your thoughts yeah so it's funny that you I thought for sure you were going to say online pornography um because I I would probably put in terms of risk to men living in the world today I would probably put that above um online gambling but I I I would make online gambling a close second and this you know it's very hard to get actual data on on this um but this is sort of based on um my clinical impression what I'm seeing you know of course I'm seeing treatment Seekers but um yeah this is an enormous problem I always like to start by emphasizing the vast majority of people who gamble will not get addicted to gambling and that's true for any drug right so most people will be able to moderate their use but as with drugs and alcohol about 20 well 10 to 20% of folks who consume will develop an addiction an addiction is a brain disease a very serious and potentially life-threatening one and until you've either experienced it yourself or seen it in somebody you care about deeply it's really hard to imagine how people could get to a place where they would sacrifice everything in in pursuit of their drug but that's exactly what happens and so what is the vulnerability there what is the difference you know and and and the risks I usually classify into nature nurture and neighborhoods so nature some people are inherently more vulnerable than others but as we've talked about drug of choice matters if you meet your drug of choice and it's gambling you may never get addicted to alcohol but gambling may just be the end of you um co-occurring psychiatric disorders people at risk because of a kind of a self medication myth and cycle we know that trauma contributes to the risk of addiction that's the nurture part of it but also neighborhood is really key and this again the ecosystem that we live in the the easier it is to get your drug of choice the more of it you'll use the more you'll change your brain and the more likely you will be to develop a very serious addiction so um yeah I mean gambling is everywhere I there there's enough data to verify your impression that it's more men than women although women also struggle with it the true the same is true for online pornography more men than women develop an addiction to that although women do develop um pornography and sex addictions um you know there are some addictions where women are more vulnerable than men like online shopping um and social media but in terms of the gambling and pornography definitely men are more vulnerable and I absolutely agree with you that this is a huge and largely unseen problem complicated as you say by the shame issue where for gambling addiction there's still so much about in our culture about being a man who becomes wealthy and successful as sort of our modern-day hero that if you're somebody who's you know not done that or you know God forbid gotten into financial trouble very very hard to come forward and ask for help and frankly the same is true with sex and pornography addiction we have this prevailing cultural I believe false notion that all men are sexual predators um and so to come forward you can only imagine the shame of somebody having to come forward and say like I'm addicted to sex or I'm addicted to pornography or I watch you know these types of uh pornographic images and they're stimulating for me very shameful very hard I've had patients come in and like on their you know come in and say they had a problem with like some drug which wasn't even their problem it was pornography and it took them four visits to be able to admit it he huge huge problem here and again access ease of access quantity um it's all you know all the touch of our fingertips which just makes it very very difficult for us as humans who are reflexively wired to approach pleasure and avoid pain to withstand The Lure of these incredibly potent drugs there are professors an academic such yourself looking at gaming I found it really difficult to find anybody with deep domain expertise or peer-reviewed research around porn and my my assumption is that professors don't want to be known as Professor porn that there's actually shame in the academic Community you don't want to be that guy or gal it's like why did you decide to do that Professor it's just there's it's the second largest category I think on the internet and relative to the size of it there's a ridiculous scant amount or dir of research around it I had thought that or some of the stuff I've read is that it's a small population consuming a dis proportionate amount of porn that most men young men and young women are able to modulate it my fear around it has always been that it just being very transparent one of the reasons I went on campus every day at UCLA was one CU I knew I was supposed to go to class but two the prospect that I might meet someone who over the medium or long term would decide to have sex with me yeah you sound like my son well I think I sound like this I sound like most sons in their head and I think I just articulate it and if I'd had porn available at home I'm pretty certain I wouldn't have been on on campus five days a week I might have gone to four or three or two because it just might have been E I mean the reality is I wanted sex so badly and my hormones were raging so much that I was willing to take social risk and go out and try and meet people and by the way I think that's really healthy yeah to think I want to take these risks I want to meet people in hopes that I can have a coffee invite to a party establish a relationship and at some point along the way maybe have those types of physical encounters I think that is really really healthy and I worry that and curious to get your take that it's not the hardcore addicts that are screwing up America around this stuff it's that it just decreases across an enormous population of young men their willingness to establish connections with others that we're evolving in we're we're maturing a new species of asexual asocial males that never get categorized or clinically diagnosed as addicts but are just alone their whole lives and never develop these skills is there a lowlevel form of I don't even call it addiction but avoidance or replacement theory that could be even more damaging than what we think of as traditionally diagnosed addiction absolutely and there are data to support this so young people are having for all our liberated sexual Moors young people are having less sex today than ever before um and many young men will report that they feel like the social landscape out there when it comes to dating and having sex is so uncertain and such a landmine that they just end up staying home watching pornography and masturbating and for folks who are vulnerable to that as their drug of choice it can evolve to the point where they literally cannot stop um like with any drug they need more potent forms over time so pornography becomes chat rooms chat rooms become you know meeting in person um prostitutes um child pornography I mean this is a huge issue right now of and and by the way I think your your point here about it being so widespread that we can hardly even call it it's like an endemic disease you know it's not even like a rare disease um I have had you know in the last little bit of like the last month two mothers call me who are in desperation because their sons have been identified as viewers of child pornography now these are teenage boys who are watching teenage girls um and who now are facing potential felony so I I just think that the whole system is not set up for the degree to which this Behavior has become so widespread so normative I mean we can't be convicting all of these young men of felonies and I'm not I'm not by any means uh endorsing child pornography or teen pornography you know my my personal opinion is that none of it's good um for so many reasons but the the issue is we have a court system who is now looking to convict an 18year old boy for viewing pornography of a 17-year-old girl and and facing like being a lifetime sexmen like that our legal system has clearly not caught up with what is happening and the corporations that make and profit from these media are not remotely being held responsible for what's going on I mean this is this is really endemic proportion problems and yeah in terms of creating you know it's kind of I mean I talk about the smartphone as our masturbation machines and I I mean that like in every sense of the word um that's what they are we're we're using the internet and these devices to meet all of these needs that used to require other people and and part of what connects people together is our interdependency our mutual need if we didn't need other people we wouldn't bother to do the work to go interact with them cuz it's a heck of a lot of work and it's complicated and and it's you know it's ambiguous and it's painful you know because of all the ways in which we're all so complicated so yeah this is a huge problem we we're like we're like we're we're creating a generation of mole people as in mole the animals who who never go out and never leave their little hidey holes super scary we'll be right back and I'm sure you get calls from government officials and DC and Sacramento asked for your advice on this stuff I think most of this if I if I could think of one thing to try and set a context that would reduce addiction it would be third spaces and that is trying and get as many young people as often as possible in the company of other young people and in the company of potential mentors friends and mates I was in Israel after uh October 7th at the Nova Music Festival site or or Memorial and I met with an ID Battalion of IDF soldiers and there were this these young extraordinary fit 120 kids 19 to 21 outdoors in the company of each other many of them go on to start businesses together lifelong friends a lot of them meet their spouses Outdoors serving in the agency of something bigger than themselves right and I thought I just don't think nearly as many of these young adults are going to end up addicts and I thought how can we how can we do this a million times in different ways whether it's continuing education softball league Church nonprofit like third spaces if I could do one thing it would be third spaces what is the one thing your thoughts on that and what is the one or two things you would want to do to set up a context of success and addiction avoidance because we are creatures innately designed to approach pleasure and avoid pain we need to create spaces where we have access to healthy sources of pleasure and an sufficient challenge to make that interesting enough for us that we creatures who need a certain degree of friction find it interesting and also spaces that um limit our access to unhealthy sources of pleasure unhealthy dopamine as in the instant pleasures of the the various intoxicants we've been talking about so I love the idea of third spaces but you know it it sounds a little rarified like it would be for the elite and the wealthy we have the potential to create those third spaces in the public school system where kids spend the vast majority of their lived hours so after school programs not even after school during school how can we do that get smartphones out of schools bell to Bell create give give Hands-On Pro bring back what happened to I mean I didn't like you know autoshop but at least we had it you know I mean let's have more art more Hands-On stuff let's have writing classes where they're not allowed to use chat GTP and they get real you know not to say that we should never use those tools but everything's gone online in the schools it's all digitized we're we're we're learning everything by watching somebody else do something kids need to do and schools are the place the default place to make that happen which means getting the digital drugs out of their hands during schooltime hours I'm also a huge believer in age verification we have to recognize that digital media is a drug for the vulnerable the vulnerable include a kid with a developing brain we cannot have 5-year-olds on iPads for eight hours a day what do you think that number is is it 16 is it 12 what is it I think it's at minimum at minimum minum 13 and and even then I think there has to be a lot more in terms of guard rails so we really need real age verification like the real deal you know where you have like a third party site you register and I know there's a lot of problems with that in terms of people's privacy but I'm sorry we make a lot of sacrifices to protect the vulnerable few as we should do in our society and we already don't let kids drive cars buy firearms go into casinos and Gamble byy cigarettes by alcohol by drugs we already join the military yeah we age get a lot of things yeah like we we recognize that kids have vulnerable brains and that their frontal lobe isn't fully connected and that you know if we just let them run a muck we would have many fewer kids on the planet and we would you know we got to protect our kids so that that's what I think do you have kids doctor I do yeah and what advice would you have I I find it difficult sometimes to discern between normal adolescent Behavior which is abnormal as far as I can tell and when I should be worried when I should think okay he's just he takes his phone into the bathroom to watch Tik Tok and pretends he's in the bathroom for 10 20 minutes okay is this 14-year-old Behavior or should I be worried and as someone who's been a parent and um like what pieces of advice I how old your children are but as it relates to addiction are there any sort of unlocks or critical success factors or red flags in your child's Behavior where you can help discern the difference between what you call not necess Behavior we shouldn't correct you know get out of the bathroom enough already but where you probably think okay this is getting serious and might require professional intervention yeah so there's no blood test or brain scan a diagnose addiction we we base it on phenomenology on on What's called the DSM the diagnostic and statistical Manual of mental disorders which which briefly summarized is the foresees control compulsions cravings and consequences especially uh continued use despite consequences the problem is that a lot of kids use substances engage in addictive behaviors and um don't have obvious consequences so it's very hard to tell at that age because they're young they're resilient and they're good at hiding it so although you won't find these criteria in the DSM I think a warning sign to look for unless they're obvious signs of unraveling but if you've got a kid who you know isn't obviously unraveling but you're kind of wondering is look for lying and other antisocial Behavior again you won't find that in any psychiatric diagnostic manual but I think those are very important soft signs of something going wrong with the kid or in the family now all people lie the average adult tells one to two Lies per day these tend to be small little lies about you know hiding our own selfishness and foibles and teenagers definitely lie but if you get a kind of a more significant systematic lying about where I've been who I was with what I was doing um or even just kind of antisocial Behavior rudess hostility rage um these are the things that I think you know we should look for as potential warning signs for something going wrong with our kid last question doctor and you've been very generous with your time very curious to get your thoughts and take on glp1 drugs glp1 drugs are super exciting I'm really glad they're here they don't work for everyone all the time because we're all unique and we have these unique brains but the more tools we have to stop the kind of addiction chatter that happens for some people the better as you know gp1 agonists are FDA approved to treat diabetes and obesity they modulate stomach emptying slow down you know the gastric flow and make people feel more full but they also work on the brain's reward pathway they modulate dopamine release or reward neurotransmitter and there is very active research now looking at their use broadly in addictions um foremost alcohol addiction but also there's some preliminary evidence for um benefit with nicotine addiction with opioid use disorder which is really interesting um as well as behavioral addictions like gambling and sex we are using them off label occasionally in our clinic for treatment refractory alcohol use disorder this is folks who have tried everything for their alcohol addiction and we're getting some good Traction in a few of our folks other folks are try it and don't find it that helpful so you know nothing is going to be like the miracle drug I don't think gp1s will either but they're exciting new development and they um can be very effective for food addiction and potentially other addictions as well Dr Anna lmy is a professor of Psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine she's also the author of the bestselling book dopamine Nation finding balance in
