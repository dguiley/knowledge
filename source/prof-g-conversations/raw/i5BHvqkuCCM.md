the government needs to stop spreading misinformation about food and nutrition um they need to stop purchasing with us tax dollars dangerous foods we do this in almost every school lunch program in the United States heck we strip the fiber out of the food and feed it to kids like sugar and call it bread even though it's really not bread and we've got to sometimes uh help support these school lunch programs with subsidies to buy healthier foods [Music] doctor where does this podcast find you I'm in New York today let's bust right into it your new book blind spots when medicine gets it wrong and what it means for our health is an eye openening book uh about the latest scientific research on the biggest Health topics of our day including hormone replacement therapy penut allergies cholesterol gut health and Rising levels of cancer in young people let's start there what does modern medicine get wrong what are the what are the biggest blind spots well modern medicine is so busy billing and coding and seeing patients in short visits that we've not been talking about the root causes of so many of these diseases that are on the rise and with cancer on the rise in young people and so we've got to talk about our poison food supply and the chemical ingredients that are engineered and added to our food that are banned in Europe and Canada now we've got to talk about environmental exposures that cause cancer not just the chemo to treat it and we've got to talk about school lunch programs not just putting every kid on OIC when they get overweight we've seen this massive explosion of chronic diseases in our lifetime didn't exist two generations ago doesn't exist in many parts of the Amish community that still use Good Farming and eat uh food from the soil and it doesn't exist in many parts of the world so we've got to look at what we're doing differently those root causes have been in our blind spots what you say really resonates the first thing I noticed uh we m to the UK 2 years ago and I'm not exaggerating the first thing I noticed was that everything in a refrigerator went bad or spoiled in two or 3 days and what I recognize is that's a feature not a bug it's because they're not putting all the preservatives and in it is that is that part of the problem that in order to increase economics and and um decrease the perishability we just put too many things in our foods that aren't healthy I've got patients that have chronic pain and nothing works we try everything in modern medicine but then they come back and say you know I spent a summer in Italy and for the first time I felt healthy and what's going on is they're eating healthy foods uh foods that are designed to go bad after some time they don't have these chemicals designed to increase the shelf life so that's a part of it along with pesticides that are you know killing insects in the crops but they're also killing our gut microbiome the bacteria that line our gut so so there's so many factors but that's exactly the sort of thing right now uh that we need to take a hard look at if you thought okay I don't have the money or I don't have the energy to totally reconfigure my diet what are two or three things you could do right away that would take out say a disproportionate amount of the risk factors in your diet well I hear that a lot I hear organic food which is food without pesticides cost too much and I tell people try the cost of insulin because a lot of these things going on today are the direct result of our poison in food supply how else do you have 40% of our nation's children that are overweight or obese and just 5% in Japan our kids in America are not more disobedient or more uh addicted as a part of their personality no we've poisoned the food supply and created highly addictive foods that have things like food dyes so food dyes for example are mostly banned in Europe and Canada so Kellogg Kelloggs makes two types of fro loops one with the band ingredients for the American kids that makes the food look all colorful and shiny and one without the band ingredients that they ship to Canada so don't American kids deserve the healthier version of food made by an American company uh California just banned seven food dyes uh 10 other states have some bans on these dieses but I would say read the ingredients simple messages I tell patients drink water avoid these sugary drinks avoid processed food with lots of ingredients and watch out for seed oils they sound natural like vegetable oil and canola and soybean oil but they're not they're denatured at high temperatures and then a chemical solvent needs used to change the structure so these are really chemicals and when they hit the GI tract guess what your body's immune system reacts to them these are things that do not occur in nature and your body is reacting with an inflammation it's not a big inflammatory storm it's a constant lowgrade inflammation and it makes people feel sick and we need to address these root causes not just medicate everybody that comes in with these sicknesses want to put forward your a thesis and get your get your response to it I've always thought that unfortunately in areas that are especially important to the well-being of our society when you inject The Profit element there's some good components to it but there's a lot of bad components and I've always thought that it's essentially the industrial food complex has a profit incentive to get you addicted to terribly addictive sugary terrible food such that they can hand you over to the industrial diabetes complex where there's a ton of money your thoughts well I think you're right the food industry started off with a charge to address food insecurity and world hunger and so they started creating techniques genetically modifying food adding uh pesticides after it was discovered in the days after Asian orange that it would kill insects but it also killed the crops so they genetically modifi the crops to be so-called Roundup Ready that where they could tolerate the pesticides well that's our modern day food supply but the problem is human beings are not made Round Up ready and so it's poisoning the human body as well so look I see the best in people and I think food in the food industry started off with this commission uh this charged to mass-produce food now we have to educate people about the unintended consequences of all these chemical ingredients in ultra-processed foods and Foods laced with pesticides for example pesticides have hormone likee binding properties food dyes are hormone disruptors is it a surprise that the average age of puberty goes down by a week and a half every year for the last 30 plus years it's now years sooner than it was a generation ago that sperm CS are down 50% in the last five decades that rates of GI cancers are increasing so these are things we don't talk about in medicine I got zero of this stuff in medical school but now that I've taken the effort to learn about it research it and summarize it for folks I'm going directly to the public as a bunch of doctors are now to try to educate people about what's happened to our food supply describe your diet what what do you try and dial up and what do you dial down well I think one of the biggest pieces of misinformation spread by the United States government and they've spread a lot of it but one of the biggest pieces has been demonizing natural fats saturated fats I'm not saying everyone needs to eat it but it's a good source of protein and when you're eating meats that are uh well sourced that is a good um uh source of nutrition the government food pyramid demonized natural fats move the entire food industry to ultra processed foods and created these refined carbohydrate addictions that have drove our obesity epidemic I like nuts I like fruits that are not coated with pesticides it's especially important to buy organic when you're eating the surface of a fruit or vegetable uh strawberry for example has been sprayed over a dozen times with 7.8 different pesticides um on average the average school lunch program may have 38 different types of pesticides detectable you can detect these things now in the urine of children in the umbilical cord blood of mothers so um I'd like to eat these are almost biblical principles right things that grow out of good soil uh clean meats and I do a little bit of intermittent fasting when I can talk about intermittent fasting why is that why is that helpful well I think in general people are not getting enough protein so i' um warn people about just starting to skip meals because you really want to get a good amount of protein in your in your meal in your day but I just try it because it I think it helps manage through a bit of willpower some of the appetite uh urges that I sense I'll tell you what had a big impact is when I got rid of artificial sweeteners the debate about art artificial sweeteners got really hijacked by the do or do they not cause cancer argument but I don't think they do they've been around for a long time but what they do is they trick your pancreas into thinking that a big sugar load is coming and it doesn't come so the pancreas is waiting for that Sugar load and it creates a craving and often results in bing eating of carbohydrates later in the day so by getting rid of those artificial sweeteners I think it helped manage my appetite so which of these topics do you think the public is most informed about what are the biggest myths in healthcare well I think for per menopausal women there's a a myth that hormone replacement therapy that is taking estrogen or estrogen plus progesterone when your body doesn't produce it anymore around the time of menopause causes cancer it's one of the greatest dogmas that still alive and well both in the medical establishment and it turns out the study that was cited where people say aha here's the study where we show it caused cancer did not show a statistically significant increase in cancer but the announcement was so magnificent and so broad by researchers at the NIH the media ran with the story before they ever looked at the data the data were released later over a week later and by that time the world had already been convinced of this Dogma now the reason I'm mentioning hormone replacement therapy when you asked what is you know what's one of the biggest misconceptions here's a medication that not only alleviates the symptoms of menopause The Hot Flashes mood swings weight gain night sweats but also has long-term health benefits because the blood vessels are healthier nitric oxide levels are higher and so heart attack rates in some studies are half or they're cut in half because uh women who start hormone therapy within 10 years of the onset of menopause the rate of cognitive decline goes down by 50 to 60% the rate of Alzheimer's goes down by 35% and a woman has stronger bones and is far less likely to break a bone or have a hip fracture so the overall long-term health benefits are overwhelming women live longer and feel better but tragically 50 million women have been denied hormone therapy since the time of this Dogma announcement that it causes breast cancer do you feel the same way about testosterone replacement therapy I don't it's very different uh with men and testosterone both men and women have testosterone and estrogen now some of the Dogma is parallel for example the Dogma that testosterone therapy causes prostate cancer another Dogma like the Dogma that hormone therapy in women causes breast cancer is not supported by the data now there are benefits and I do recommend people who are symptomatic get tested for their testosterone levels and I do see people who benefit men who benefit from testosterone replacement but the long-term health benefits are not as dramatic as we see with hormone therapy in women but if you go on testosterone replacement therapy at 57 and you find you're stronger your Skin's a little more youthful your sex is a little your erections are a little bit longer um do the benefits outweigh the drawbacks asking for a friend uh look yes the most of the time the benefits outweigh any potential downsides people just need to recognize that if you're still making some pet testosterone on your own you're probably going to shut that down by taking it exogenous you're on it the rest of your life that's what they told me yeah and you talk a little bit about the chronic disease problem what do you mean by that and how serious is it for society autism has increased 14% every year for the last 23 years what's going on like who's looking into this right we just keep medicating kids when they come in it's now one in 22 kids in California born today will be diagnosed with autism I mean it barely existed it was rare just two generations ago it's still rare in the Amish community in other parts of the world that have not adopted the Western diet and I think the autism cause discussion has also been hijacked by the is it or is it not vaccines after a fraudulent study suggested it was due to vaccines but we got to put that aside and talk about the micro biome the lining of the GI tract The Garden of bacteria that normally live in in harmony millions of different bacteria that we we alter we throw it off we carpet bomb it with um Ultra processed foods antibiotics even C-sections antibiotics and C-sections can save lives but they're massively overused especially antibiotics and a study just found that kids who take antibiotics in the first couple years compared to kids who do not had have higher rates of learning disabilities and obesity and Celiac and Asthma and you may wonder how could altering the microbiome affect mental illness well some of those bacteria make serotonin and if you look at the diets of people in Europe um it's very different they have far less chemicals they uh have lower rates of mental illness of autism of obesity of autoimmune diseases uh autoimmune diseases now affect one in five women uh what's going on here you know my field is pancreatic cancer as a surgeon at John Hopkins that specializes in the pancreas pancreatic cancer rates are going up and no one is asking why we do more pancreatic cancer work than any Hospital more pancreatic cancer research than any Center in the country nobody is asking why we've got to ask these big questions and talk about root causes it's interesting cuz I think of pancreatic cancer as a death sentence I just think it's game over is that not true um so of those who get to surgery which is a a subgroup maybe 20 to 30% of people can have the option of having surgery the 5year survival rate's about 20% so um it's it's pretty bleak and we have not made a lot of progress in the last 30 to 40 years uh so I think we've got to talk about root cause same thing with Alzheimer's Alzheimer's is skyrocketing and we spend billions of dollars on these expensive new medications that get a lot of excitement that be honestly they barely work and they have high side effects and we're not talking about the study that the Mediterranean diet was found to reduce Alzheimer significantly hormone therapy and peropon pusle women reduce Alzheimer's by 35% and Alzheimer's is associated with poor quality quity sleep on a chronic basis so we could do a lot a better job talking about these underlying root issues but I mean it sounds like and Common Sense is obviously where the inside is I've had doctors ATA and huberman on my podcasts I'm always amazed how much they get because what they say to me feels pretty Common Sense get good sleep eat better eat out less eat at home more more grains more vegetables less processed food and make sure you get some exercise I mean I'm not saying these things are easy but aren't they pretty basic and what you're talking about is preventive offensive Health Care as opposed to defensive health care after something's gone wrong is that accurate look I can tell you Peter a was with us at John's Hopkins and he is as superb as they get evidence-driven science-based logical common sense and lives what he what he says and so a bunch of us now are going directly to the public to try to educate them about these issues to say yes it is common sense but you'd be amazed 90 plus% of our food supply is sprayed by pesticides and multiple times you just saw the court case now open up the window to removing uh fluoride from drinking water or at least not adding it this was a Dogma for decades that we had to have fluoride and drinking water because it supposedly reduced risks of cavities well how about stop drinking sugary drinks if we want to reduce cavities and if the fluoride is killing the bacteria in the mouth reducing cavities what do you think it's doing to the microbiome bacteria in the gut so these are the big questions we've not been asking that we need to ask we'll be right back curious what you think I'm I'm in LA and whenever I'm in La I have a buddy here who's what I what going through a midlife crisis that he's going to grow out of in about 30 or 40 years and he always takes me to these kind of fabulous parties with a lot of very young very fabulous very attractive La people and the thing I've noticed that's changed among a younger generation is they have substantially reduced the amount of alcohol intake and they've replaced it with drugs ketamine MDMA um Edibles give me your thoughts on the health impacts of alcohol versus psilocybin versus some of these designer drugs for a lack of a better reason and I I recognize that ideally you don't do any of these things well and I'll cut to the chase I drink way too much it's where my health falls down imagine you're someone who is always probably going to have a certain level of substances in their life because correctly or incorrectly they identified it enhances their life what substances would you stay away from and how do you feel about the impacts of some of these uh more trendy um designer drugs well I can tell tell you about alcohol um so as a doctor who has dealt with liver and pancreatic issues for a long time there if there ever were any tiny benefits to the heart from drinking a glass or two of wine a day they are far eclipsed by the Damage Done to the liver so um people are look I understand people have their rituals and they they if they want to drink a glass of alcohol I think it's safer than cocaine uh but more people die of alcohol abuse than opioids and fenol and so I think we don't talk enough about the abuse potential as people need just just to be mindful of that because it's one of these things that it's in our blind spots in medicine we just sort of ignore the fact that we have um 100 up to 170,000 deaths a year from alcohol um we don't need to be celebrating and glorifying abuse of alcohol and can promote more responsible drinking and for those who choose not to drink or drink rarely which is what I do um you're going to probably sleep a little better and sometimes have a healthier liver what do you think of like ketamine MDMA I was shocked how many young people would either not drink nurse or drink but they were on ketamine or or MDMA well it's a it's it's a mixed um story because sure while we don't see the same deaths as we do from heroin with some of those um external exogenous drugs um there is the potential for abuse you just saw the uh the star of friends suffer with um ketamin overdosing it can be addictive in the past we used to use lower doses now that it's more available and people are um trying it there's an abuse potential people may not be aware of when they first try it so I mean I'm probably not the best expert to answer those questions but uh certainly we see an abuse potential pretty broad marijuana is one that I I know more about I wrote about in the book blind spots there's a Dogma that it's totally safe and I try to dispel some of that because sure it's safer than cocaine but um the idea that oh it's not a gateway drug we may want to believe that but that's not really what's supported by the data uh say it's say you use it once or twice a week to help sleep and wind down instead of alcohol and it has them in a gateway drug again asking for a friend what are your thoughts on Edibles marijuana today is not the marijuana of Woodstock it's about 10 to 20 times more potent so you want to watch those doses um you want to be aware of the fact that there it acts differently in an adult than it does in an adolescent where a develop mind may be more susceptible to the risks of future psychoses in one study uh 25% of people who use it regularly as a teenager will go on to have some psychosis related diagnosis in the future so it it may be more dangerous in in the developing mind in adolescence you said in an interview with Prager U that there's no reason anyone should ever sign a financial document in an emergency you suggester did not read or this is not a contract instead what did you mean by that yeah so by law hospitals are required to take care of you for any urgent or emergent situation and what hospitals increasingly have been doing is putting this financial contract telling you almost manipulating you to sign your life Home Mortgage retirement savings away under penalty of law just to be treated and that is if it doesn't violate the the letter of the law it violates the spirit of the law you don't have to sign your forms away my team um has done a lot of work on Hospital price gouging and predatory billing and we found that hospitals sometimes Sue patients in court to garnish their wages this violates everything sacred in our profession hospitals are there as a safe haven to take care of somebody and manipulate them to sign their life away financially I think is predatory I don't think anyone should ever sign a financial document in an emergency room so I'll put forward another thesis and I want to get you response the majority of advanced Nations have nationalized Healthcare spend about $6,500 per citizen on health care we spend 12 to 13,000 yet we have worse outcomes higher infant mortality lower uh lower age expectancy and yet the insurance industry who has inserted themselves in the middle here 45 cents on the dollar goes to Administration and profits which as far as I can tell in terms of math is responsible for the difference between what other nations spend on Healthcare and what we spend hasn't BAS basically the industrial Health Complex weaponized government inserted profit institutions to the expense of American citizens I think there's a lot of Truth in what you're saying the question is what's the solution and I've spent a lot of time in my tenure as sort of as a health policy expert in our uh John's Hopkins talking about different Health Care Systems and I'm convinced there's a better model than what we have now at the same time while there's an attractive to moving to a Single Payer system you you cut a lot of the waste in the short term a lot of the middlemen and the um the people profiteering off of say our billing and coding system ultimately governments cannot resist 10 20 years down the road doing across theboard tightenings of the belt and what it ends up doing is resulting in an underfunding of the healthcare system and we've seen that even with our own own government system Medicare uh it's massively underfunded and it just becomes a declining priority after the initial enthusiasm to have some government so it's a mixed picture I tend to focus on what's feasible and right now my concern is we can have the most goldplated health insurance for every American we can fix our broken Health Care financing but if we are still recommending bad practices and not addressing our poison food supply we're going to keep watching these chronic diseases extend so it feels as if many of these roads lead back to preventive Health Care specifically around our food supply system how do we fix that is it taxing these foods to their I mean my understanding is if you just if you just priced water at its real cost beef would be 20 or $30 a pound if you you know Bloomberg wanted to tax big gulps is it taxing these companies how do you how do you address the externalities and fix is it more regulation more pricing that reflects the damage of the externalities here how do we create a healthier food supply system so Scott you're talking to a guy who's um studied a lot of the unintended consequences of well-intended government policies so I'm a little leery of um things like uh strong government interventions and so what I would suggest is the government needs to stop spreading misinformation about food and nutrition um they need to stop purchasing with us tax doll dangerous foods we do this in almost every school lunch program in the United States heck we strip the fiber out of the food and feed it to kids like sugar and call it bread even though it's really not bread and we've got to sometimes uh help support these school lunch programs with subsidies to buy healthier foods curious to get your thoughts on gp1 drugs we're clearly seeing a reduction in short-term Health complications when people lose weight but just like you're losing excess body fat you're also losing muscle mass so everyone who prescribes these drugs is supposed to technically been be saying that you're supposed to exercise like crazy and need a high protein diet but in the real world people are not necessarily doing that and we don't know what the long-term consequences are of losing all that excess muscle mass here's one little fact people may not be aware of the number one predictor of how long you live is your muscle mass so we may be accelerating Y and even shortening lifespan despite the reduction in health complications in the short term God that's wild so everything I read about OIC I've I'm every year I do a prediction um seminar on Technologies and I said that in 2024 the most seminal technology breakthrough was glp1 drugs the stuff I've read reduces alcohol consumption biting nails they might they're talking about giving it to people with gambling and social media addictions am I overestimating the impact this might have on our society I'm a little cautious about the premature celebration that we may now have a drug to treat addiction and it may be a secondary effect because you probably feel better about yourself when you lose weight and may just have a more positive outlook and better willpower so I'm a little cautious when Pharma says we have a solution for everything but I will tell you this um Scott we are seeing now a new generation of glp1 drugs like OIC that are about to come to Market there's estimated to be 29 that are going to come to Market in the next 20 years or so and some of these now are designed to block that receptor on the muscle so it may not reduce muscle mass as is our concern with OIC and movia and some of the others so we'll have to see um but here's a question I pose to most doctors when I talked to them about this topic have you seen anybody come off of OIC and keep the weight off just from diet and exercise I'd like to see that be a nice population of people before I recommend it too broadly and um final question just something personal someone in a high pressure job you're obviously very ambitious any thoughts on being a good partner when you're trying to have the kind of impact you have and the demands it places on your professional life yeah um I think what we've seen is that the happiest communities in America are those with um strong social networks and when you look at the mlot work at Berkeley on workplace satisfaction one of the greatest drivers of happiness at the workplace is the amount of positive feedback you get directly as a result of your time and services and we're learning now in in an amazing study that blew me away as a doctor that when you energetically and enthusiastically comp someone else then you actually increase your own endorphin levels at a level higher than that of an anti-depressant love that be generous that's that's the best medicine Dr Marty McCary is a renowned surgeon and professor at John's Hopkins public health expert and leading advocate for healthcare transparency and a two-time New York Times best-selling author his latest book blind spots when medicine gets it wrong and what it means for our health is out now he joins us from new New York City do I really enjoyed this conversation thanks for your good work I think it's having a real impact thanks so much Scot good talking with you appreciate it
