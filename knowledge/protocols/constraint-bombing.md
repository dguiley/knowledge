# Constraint Bombing

> When you identify a constraint, attack it violently from all angles until it's no longer your problem.

## When To Use

- You've identified the ONE thing limiting your growth
- You've been taking "reasonable" action but it hasn't worked
- You're stuck and need to break through

## The Process

1. **Identify the constraint** - What's actually limiting you right now? Not 5 things. ONE thing.

2. **Gather all inputs** - On this single topic:
   - Read many books
   - Watch all videos
   - Hire experts for real-time coaching
   - Take courses
   - Find mentors who've solved it

3. **Attack violently** - Do ALL of them, not just one:
   > "I don't care which one works. I will do all of them violently."

4. **Maintain until solved** - Keep pressure until this is no longer your constraint

5. **Identify next constraint** - The constraint will change. Repeat.

## The Mindset

This isn't about finding the "right" approach. It's about overwhelming force on one problem:

- Not "which book should I read?" → Read all of them
- Not "should I hire a coach?" → Hire the coach AND take the course AND watch the videos
- Not "is this working?" → Keep going until it's obviously solved

## Appendix

### A. Source Material

> "If I needed to learn sales, I'm going to read many sales books, consume all videos on sales, hire somebody who's good at sales to teach me in real time, and I will keep doing this until sales is no longer my problem."

### B. Common Mistakes

- Taking "reasonable" action (read one book, wait to see if it works)
- Attacking multiple constraints simultaneously
- Giving up before the constraint is actually solved
- Not identifying the real constraint (symptom vs cause)

### C. Related Concepts

- Rule of 100 (volume on a specific tactic)
- Self-awareness (identifying what's actually limiting you)
- Focus framework (one thing at a time)
