say oh it's obvious that Trump's better for business because he's a business person he lowers regulation he's lower taxes all the classic things that you know uh people say hey that's that's good for business but what they miss is what's fundamentally critical for business is kind of a stable Society a rule of law Society you know kind of open markets and good relationships with other countries for you know kind of products and services and in all of that Trump is essentially a [Music] disaster Reed where does this podcast find you I am just outside Seattle Biden question mark you're you're sort of an El you've become sort of this elder Statesman of the tech community and what I'll call center left politics uh what are your thoughts on the state of play around the calls for Biden or the concern I I won't even say calls the concerns around the Biden campaign right now well I mean he obviously had a frankly just you know disastrous uh debate performance in terms of kind of what I think my family would call Senior moments in the thing and that obviously you know legitimately causes a bunch of concern you know I obviously you know if you kind of asked me you know which am I more concerned about a bad debate with senior moments or a lying felon who doesn't care about the country I have a clear a clear point of view about which one is more disqualifying for being president but it's obviously you know I don't mean to paper over the concerns because you know I think probably everybody would prefer people who are 20 years younger contending for the presidency um it's just a question of do you express your age through slowness but kindness and care or demented lying so a lot of this comes down to I mean we'll know this will either happen or not happen I think in the next couple weeks just logistically I mean time is on both Biden and Trump's side now that if Biden for whatever reason doesn't succumb to the pressure or I mean at some point it becomes logistically infusible to replace him right and I think his his view right now or his perception is right now the path to presidency would be I'm not him meaning Trump the thing that I think would force him out and I'm curious if you believe this is true is if there was a dramatic reduction in donor money and you're a whale you are in the you're Fly you're at a rare altitude both in terms of your own personal giving but also the people you know um I'm when what what I I bucket the fundraising into whales such as yourself porposes such as myself they give tens of thousands but not millions and then the the small you know small money donors uh the called them minnows but a lot of minnow can make up you know formidable Force but what I see is the purposes are in full Revolt the people I speak to are not only WR signing letters to try and ask to get them to step down but starting to try and think about the next wave of candidates and commit money to supporting them what is happening among the whales in terms of their giving are they holding back are they taking a wait and see attitude are they ring around the president what's going on at your altitude I would say that they're just like the porposes and you know uh I'd actually rather be you know in the in this in the Beast area I'd rather be you know youus is and Dophin you'd rather be flipper yes exactly um but I would say that it's the same you know amongst the the whales there's a there's a deep concern about if you're showing fatigue now and it's four months of of of a very grueling path you know what does that look like and does that give Americans you know not the right sense of what the the Vigor of you know I care about kind of everyday Americans and I care about you know people other than myself you know what does that present like and um and I'd say that the the whales are also wait and see is probably too passive but very concerned with what the forward path looks like and so therefore are you know I'd say donations have slowed down a lot from that now on the other hand of course you know one of the things that was very interesting to me about kind of looking at the post debate was how much Grassroots went way up and it maybe you know a function of you know seeing Biden as a as is he is a very decent man who cares about other people you know so I always worry a little bit about you know what what the perspectives are and make sure that you can see you know what is the everyday American or the youth perspectives and not just you know kind of from where I sit but to put a fine point on you're one of the deepest voices in the Democratic party right now people listen to you Reed where are you today do you feel the best course of action would be to mature battle test and support and rally around another candidate or for us to stop this and rally around Biden well I would like to see Biden show the Vigor of campaigning that he is going to need to see that's not just like the ABC inter but maybe call it the ABC interview every day if we see that then I think we should be you know rallying around Biden and stopping this discussion if we don't see that if this is just the the you know look you know he's he's dedicated his entire life to public service this everything he's done and has contributing massively but if it's like look I'm I can only imagine what running at his age is like it's like look I'm too tired for this then it's like then I think we should you know kind of open up the field but you do still think it's a possibility that he can demonstrate that type of vigor in a short enough time to give people an option that it's not a it's not a run out the clock strategy that you think that they're no I I would oppose a run out the clock strategy my voice and as much as you know my voice matters in any of this stuff is come be vigorous now you wrote a pretty powerful piece I think I read it in the economist talking about um that Silicon Valley Business Leaders who are endorsing Trump because they believe he is better for business what is the sentiment you've been hearing and how exactly why do you think Trump is bad for business so one of the things I think that people kind of say oh it's obvious that Trump's better for business because he's a business person he lowers regulation he's lower taxes all the classic things that you know uh people say hey that's that's good for business but what they miss is what's fundamentally critical for business is kind of a stable Society a rule of law Society you know kind of open markets and good relationships with other countries for you know kind of products and services and in all of that Trump is essentially a disaster and so part of the reason I wrote this piece for business people was to say don't you know kind of think oh 1% or 2% differences in tax rates matter don't think that look and I and actually appreciates one of the things like people say are you objective about Trump and it's like yeah actually I think one of the things that he did well was to say hey if you want a new regulation remove an old regulation I think that's a I think that's a good refactoring of Regulation stance but don't think that's what's most important for business what's actually in fact important for business is kind of rule of law and stability and Trump basically attacks all of that and I I I kind of came a professional age in the valley but I don't feel as if I'm in touch with it because I've been gone so long and I've always and this might be a reductive analysis but I find there's this frightening vein or ideology in the valley of kind of this techn libertarian notion that government is bad and that if we could just uh let smarter people run the organ you know run the company defer to the markets or and specifically if the markets could kind of defer to the technology leaders that we'd all be better off and I find it very disconcerting given that I I don't think these individuals recognize how blessed they are by some of the underpinnings of and blessings rule of law an incredible business ecosystem am I being dramatic here is the is there sort of a concerning vein of this sort of technol libertarian within the valley no I don't think you're being dramatic I basically completely agree it's one of the reasons why you know kind of I argue for the value of of of government the value of of better government there's never great government there's always inefficiencies there but the difference between you know call it B and B+ um can actually make a very big difference and I think the libertarian thing which by the way comes from um in some places comes from places that are not terrible which is um like hey we can build amazing new companies amazing new technologies those can make a very big difference I agree with all of that very strongly um but the notion that it's like oh government is bad or gets in the way it's like well actually in fact if you look at everything that our Silicon Valley entrepreneurship you know can create comes from many different platforms that government has enabled isn't just rule of law isn't just a peaceful Society isn't just a um you know kind of University system and technology system and funding of these technologies that then you know get created in a companies but it's it's it's the very kind of the system that we can deploy our products and services and hire talent and offer you know kind of stock um you know for sale and all of that's within a government regulated environment so I I I frequently argue vifer with you know what I refer to as techn Libertarians so let's switch to AI um where are you most bearish and bullish when it comes to use cases and applications let's see so on the bearish side what I would say is that there's a couple things one is it's hard to know exactly where to be bearish over time because I think Ethan mullik and co-intelligence you know said something you know that's a good Maxim which is the worst AI you're ever going to use is the AI you're using today um and there's a bunch of things that are that are kind of being developed now I think people being overly polanish about oh you know AI is going to solve Fusion for us in three years is I think you know a mistake in various ways in the positive sense I think that it's funny even with all the hype I think it's to some degree understated relative to if you think about the fact we are language creatures and that everything we do is in language and you have at minimum a language amplifier so you say well I have a steel manufacturing company what's AI going to do for me it's like well but you have sales you have manufacturing you have financial analysis you have meetings you have decisions all of which there's going to be essentially co-pilots for and so I'm very bullish across all of this productivity that doesn't mean that it doesn't come without challenges in terms of how the how jobs change and you know all the rest but I think that the amplification here is really big and what's more it doesn't even get to like you know the two kind of cases that I usually use is I have a line of sight to having a tutor and a medical assistant on every smartphone that you know is kind of there for for every human being who has access to a smartphone which is you know amazing human elevation but I also think it gets interesting in terms of you know what does it mean for you know drug Discovery or other kinds of places where the the the the deeper uses of the of language and predict the next token can actually apply to things that make a huge difference for the quality of human life so overly very very bullish bar on paana short-term claims one of the concerns uh I have and I think some I think a decent number of people share is that Technologies either go to existing players or new players and it feels with AI that while there's some new brands it feels as if the majority of the spoils are going to not only existing players but a small number of existing players you are a co-founder and inflection which got my understanding is got sold to open AI um you're on the Board of Microsoft Amazon's and investor in anthropic it all feels very incestuous are you at all worried about the concentration or increased concentration of wealth and power to even a smaller circle of companies and individuals and what is probably the next big technology well there's multiple questions there so I'm going to kind of unpack them a little bit uh one inflection is still a going company you know I had a board meeting a couple weeks ago ago um it did a business deal with Microsoft which involved a license and Mustafa San went over to build agents for them because we we pivoted away from Agents to B2B stuff um and so there'll be a bunch of stuff analysis that's just a small thing well I actually think the actual truth of matter is the rewards everyone's investing pretty heavily but the rewards haven't really started showing up yet I'm not concerned by that some people tend say well hey you doing all this investment why isn't the reward show up you know this and the answer is actually in fact the most interesting things are the things that compound over 10 years versus you know something makes a difference in you know you invest this year and your your your profit margin goes up next year so I don't think the Ws actually have been divided up that much yet um now what is showing is that one part of the Revolution that we're in here is a scale compute Revolution and the ability to drive scale compute is mostly not very much of a startup game um there's there's a reason why or if if it is a startup game like open AI it's adjacent to large companies so you got open AI which is adjacent to uh Microsoft you've got anthropic which is adjacent to Amazon you know Etc as essentially what what's driving them and that does mean that there is some limitation there that's doesn't mean that that's a that's a necessarily critical problem because there's all kinds of places where you say well I would like to you know create a startup of a desktop search company and you can't really do that what what you want for the vulnerability of these of companies to be taken is by with new technologies new platforms new other kinds of things as ways of doing it not necessarily by going at their strengths now that being said the the I think the deepest most implicit part of your question is is there startup opportunity here that can build new Pillars of Strength um that are not being subsumed to a smaller number of companies and I think the answer is absolutely yes I think that startups not only can use a ton of the different models that are being built but also you know they're going to have the opportunities to build you know pretty amazing companies because we have multiple large language models that are competing with each other like if it was just one large language model that would be a concern because then you kind of say hey we're going to try to grab all the economics yourself but you not only have Google and Microsoft and open AI competing with each other but you have multiple other folks trying to come into the entry there and you can look at what anthropic and Amazon are doing um and so I think there's a lot of startup operator and I'm putting my money where my mouth is as an investor at graylock and and personally and starting inflection and all of this so I I actually think that that that you know the the very last point I think this is probably the deepest point that you and I have some interesting zones or one of the deep points I don't know if it's the deepest of conflict in is that I actually think we're you know call it five to seven large tech companies heading to 15 not five to seven heading to three you think that this is going to create that will birth new Giants here and that this the ecosystem will actually it's not going to be one apex predator killing everybody or you don't think it's going to be consolidation you think that it'll spawn new Giants exactly do you think there's a bit of a bubble I I don't it's hard to argue that AI isn't going to have a seminal impact on business and the economy and Society do you think we might be in a bit of a bubble as it relates to valuations well it's definitely which we always get in new technology waves which is people go we know there's going to be a huge impact they embeding on tons of companies and so it creates a valuation increase across a lot of companies and then in retrospect you go well I was clearly a bubble because a number of those companies that valuation increased was incorrect right um but on the other hand part of how the market functions is to say hey we we know we're all kind of putting our bets on which ones are going to be which ones are going to be the enduring big ones which are going to be the new big ones um and which ones are are not going to hit the wave and so I think to some degree there's a significant number of companies which will show in retrospect have their valuations bit up in ways that um I disagree with with I didn't buy right I don't do shorts I just don't think I I build I build things for long but I kind of don't B don't buy those valuations on the other hand of course the whole game is well which ones actually have CAU this and this will be the next technological wave that's bigger than you know the internet mobile cloud computing because it it compounds all of them it it it amplifies them to the next level there's people have outlined a bunch of potential dangers from AI whether it's sentient or concentration or self-healing weapons or you know being being used as uh for Miss and disinformation what risks do you think are underhyped if any and which ones are overhyped so I think the ones that are underhyped are and tend to get masked by a number of things is you know this is you know with my uh book impromptu I basically said this this is amplification intelligence uh his way of looking at it versus artificial intelligence and kind of human amplification and Bad actors being Amplified so whether it's cyber criminals terrorists Rogue States you know it's one of the the things that you know has me you know very concerned about what these things are like in the in the kind of the in the cyberspace realm to use a dated term but to to think you know we have a bunch of equivalent of open Warfare going on you know across the internet in in hacking and in security where you know governments aren't really doing much about that and you know what can AI do to amplify that I think is uh and I mean governments collectively as in kind of you know International treaties that are being written and enforced and so I think that's the that's the underhyped and the area that I'm most focused on I think the overhyped one is kind of versions of the super intelligent robots are coming for us because I think it's the with the robots that are much more concerning um immediately than the than the super intelligent robots and um I'll give you a small example last year I was asked to sign this 22w statement that a bunch of people I love and trust and admire signed which is you know AI is an existential risk along with climate change pandemic Etc and the reason I didn't is because AI is also the only one of this list that has massive things in the positive buckets how to solve pandemic how to be looking for asteroids how to be um you know Computing you know energy grids to try to reduce you know Carbon Footprints and energy chains and so I actually think the the whole existential risk super intelligence it's not a an absolute zero% but if you ask me to say is super intelligence risk of AI more likely all a Terminator or is being is the Earth being hit by an a asteroid more likely I'm not sure which one I would which I would put as more likely if you were to advise hopefully the Biden or a blue Administration around AI do you think that they're headed in the right direction in terms of I mean so far there really hasn't been regulation there's been sort of like this regulation Manifesto of like this is what we might do what were you what would your advice be around government involvement or regulation or lack thereof with respect of AI well I think the bid administration's done a like a really good process which is first bring the companies in sweat them for voluntary commitments you know work work really push them very hard on that see what set of things is possibly doable then put that into an executive order um within a frame be focused and limited like okay what happens with you know High compute models and so forth rather than trying to solve every imagined problem because you know for example if someone come to to you and say he okay I want an approval or two ton death machine that someone can get drunk and run over a kid with they'd say well here's a 100 things you should fix and one or two of them seat belts you know um you know in airbags or should be on the list but then there's a hundred other things so you only really get there by working your way through it so I think the the administration you know has done a good process on this and I do think that our tool set for navigating both great opportunity and human elevation and and preventing the the challenges get stronger as we're building stuff and so I think we want to be very focused and limited and until we actually you know are really blocking the real harms we'll be right back you're an investor and a couple of the things you've invested in are you funded eing Carol's defamation suit against president Trump and now you're helping Finance smart Maddox case I'm just curious It's it feels like it's a new wave of of investing I don't know if you pioneered it or Peter teal did but it's it's a very interesting means of I call it investing I don't know what the term would be but walk us through your thought process for why you decided to do it and talk a little bit about the smartmatic case and why you decided to get behind it it feels a little strange and I wish you know I didn't feel the need to be doing what I was doing here but it it's very much rule of law and high functioning democracy and you know part of the the thing here is to say look we we we should always be resolved to to as a strong a rule of law system as possible now part of that's by the way for example every single scholarly and any source of Integrity says the 2020 election was fair right was Fair doesn't mean it was perfect but it was fair to the standards of every other election in modern history and so um so then you get to okay well people who attack that are trying to degrade our democracy degrade our trust and belief in rule of law and by the way that trust is part of how it functions and so supporting the rule of law is the thing that is been I'd say fundamental across my you know uh democracy investing um but also in terms of saying hey the let's have the the legal system work because one of the things that you as you saw with for example the Dominion suit against Fox is unlike when you're kind of litigating just a freedom of speech political thing people can lie through their teeth and have no consequences when you're lying through your teeth and saying hey the 2020 election was stolen and you know your texts show that you're lying through your teeth um and that that's the influence that you as a news media organization are having upon the culture beliefs Etc of society in a commercial case you're allowed to be held accountable by a jury by a system of law by depositions and inquiry by showing what your actual Communications are uh to each other about how you're lying with this and I think that's part of what's really important important and so people say well but that's you know I I I I've heard the CL that's law fair and it's like look the whole point about our our legal system and having 12 jurors like for example the 12 jurors who convicted uh Donald Trump unanimously of 34 felonies on doing uh hush money payments and covering it up for political purposes um for sleeping with a porn star both of prosecutor attorneys and the defense attorneys helped select the journey there were probably several Trump voting jurists amongst that you know anous thing and one of them even said that they get a lot of their news from truth social and that's a jury system and so the rule of law and a jury system is the thing that I'm very much supportive of and investing uh might be the right term but it's really Investing For Truth right and the jury system is a proxy for getting the truth I apologize for around here but I wrote down a series of questions I wanted to your thoughts on um I'm just really curious to get your thoughts on what you are your general Impressions and what you think can and should be done regarding um some of the activities we've had on some of our Elite universities and if you think the government or the federal government should be playing with more active role if this is something that is a signal of something deeper and more more mendacious or more troubling in the US but I'm curious what Reed Hoffman's thoughts were when you saw what was going on on our campuses well I've been concerned about it for a number of years and you know that same techn libertarian group you know yells about wokeism very loudly and I by the way agree I think that the point of a university is to be intellectually challenged it's you know part of you know what I uh loved about my you know undergraduate at Stanford where you know Peter teal and I would argue a tremendous amount and so forth and I think that a lot of that lack of kind of rigor and thinking is a problem like for example the most idiotic thing that I I think I've heard you know said out of someone in the campus is you know from The River To The Sea I'm anti- genocide and you're like from the river to a to the sea is a genocidal comment you may not be in formed enough to know like understand that there is there's kind of genocide and abuse in lots of different vectors here and it's very complicated and that you know like defending um the fact that we have centuries not just World War II of you know genocide you know masking and anti-Semitism and a lot of the way that that various Arab influences including the Iranian sponsorship ship of the Hamas attack is based on genocidal impulses you know like be a little bit more educated and informed and and sophisticated in your compassion so as we wrap up here and you've been generous with your time read you've checked a lot of boxes you it sounds like you have a really a really positive relationship with your spouse you're obviously hugely successful uh professionally and economically you're have a lot of influence on a national stage like what boxes are left for you if you think in 10 or 20 years there's a few things a few boxes I'd like to check either in indelible link things you've already done but you want to do more of or new boxes what are those things well I mean I you know every uh major public interest technology thing in in Silicon Valley I've been a somehow associated with uh usually or you know like it's you know Board of Kaa Board of Milla Etc because trying to figure out how we build techn scale technology for society is been a relevant thing also you know helping the folks who stood up the usds and US digital service and you know CTO office so I think technology for Humanity and Society continues to be a very strong interest and how do we do that and by the way that I'm not anti-corporation I'm just want to get broader then right as a as a way of doing it I also think that the Notions of you know kind of like you know once upon a time I was thinking about you know kind of questions around philosophy and kind of how do we know who we are as human beings and a society who we should be and like for example a question on artificial intelligence is how does it change our epistemology I mean I think you know a lot of our epistemology has been driven by the printing press and books and kind of sharing information that way what kind of new knowledge artifacts will will you know AI be an engender and what does that mean for what it is to be human and and kind of uh uh philosophy and those those would be some gestures uh at some stuff that I'm you know continuing to work on but you know part of I think what it can be amazing about life is you know discovering something I'm you know that is ah you know it's this thing that I should be doing and so staying active in order to find those and final question Reed a lot of young men listen to this podcast and I know you don't have kids but you've been married for 20 years what advice would you have to young men who are uh recently married about being a good partner you know I think it's to be serious about it to think every week every month how could I be a better partner uh have conversations and explicit conversations with it you know sometimes people find that very awkward but you kind of hey we have call it you you know a date night a month where we talk about like how could we be better with each other uh in the relationship and allow kind like yeah this didn't kind of work that well and this could be better and so and and to bring that thing just like you get better at everything else that involves care intent skills and bring that that's great Reed Hoffman is an accomplished entrepreneur investor and strategist he's been a gry loock where he focuses on early stage investing since 2009 Reed is also
