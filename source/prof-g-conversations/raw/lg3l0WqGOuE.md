give us your read on China as it relates to the war in Ukraine and what that means in terms of everyone's favorite you know bogey man the possible invasion of Taiwan I think she is playing this one very intelligently he's getting tons of free oil and gas from Russia he's insisting they hard pipe it to the east to him so that can't be undone he is uh doing everything possible to create that sense of your partnership on the part of [Music] Putin Admiral stas where does this podcast find you I am in the northern part of Florida near panra beach it's one of the beach towns for Jacksonville so I I would just love to get your thoughts as someone who was whose name was constantly floated as a potential vice presidential candidate for secretary Clinton and other uh democratic hopefuls give us a sense for what you think is going on here and if you were to attempt to speculate what might play out over the next week this is I I don't know if it's the strangest political moment I've ever experienced maybe I'm just I'm much more attuned to it now but obviously a tremendous amount of Doubt around the Biden campaign but their Camp says they're steadfast in their commitment to stay in the race but there's sort of this drip drip drip of uh party Elders coming out and suggesting that he stepped down give us a sense of someone who's been pretty close to this and someone who thinks a lot about strategy what do you think is going on here that the public does or does not see and what do you think plays out I'll give you the historical piece and I at least am old enough to remember a similarly difficult moment to absorb and that was of course Watergate and the resignation of a president in advance of criminal proceedings being brought against him Richard Nixon that's a long time ago so yeah we're in 50 years of kind of Uncharted Territory by comparison uh although we've seen now three impeachments one of Clinton and two of uh of trump so we're not complete innocence in this sort of strange season but here's where I'm at on this one um as I watch that debate I felt sad for the country the choice we're being presented is at this moment um a convicted felon with multiple multiple character flaws on full display and on the other side an individual for whom I have a lot of affection a lot of respect um but um Father Time appears to me to have caught up with him and he is not from all that I can see um in a good place to be prepared for four more years I think you could have a convers ation if we were looking at it for a year in advance um but four more years when you look at the progression so a bad set of choices in terms of how it plays out I can answer that in three words I don't know and nobody does literally nobody does not even Joe Biden in my view knows how this one's going to play out so what I think will happen over the next week to 10 days U the Democratic party is going to have to make a choice of either putting itself 100% behind a President Who seems uh physically frail and weak uh and hope for the best in the fall or they're going to have to find a new path and I'll conclude with this professor there is nowhere in the Constitution where it says Republican party Democratic party someone said to me the other day oh they have to go with Biden because the Constitution demands it there neither Constitution nor law govern political parties we've had a plethora of political parties in this country and they get to make up the rules and so they have every opportunity to conduct a mini primary or they could pass the Baton to kamla um they've got a convention coming up I think we are in extremely unpredictable Waters does the military or the arms do they have a voice here no and you ought to be very glad that they do not every military member at every grade raises his or her right hand and swears an oath as follows I state your name to solemnly swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic that oath is sworn to the Constitution the military will resolutely avoid being embroiled in this and that's the kind of Republic we want to be uh that's well said there's a lot that's uncomfortable about this but one of those things is do you see our adversaries being more emboldened while there's we're in a state of chaos do they do you think they sense weakness and tumult and are more inclined to uh be more offensive or bold in their actions I do and that is a a significant risk and you can break it down frankly into uh two significant periods of high risk one is from now through the election I think there the risk is going to be um a a Mal actor deciding now would be a good time to launch a for example massive Cyber attack against the United States there's distraction there might not be a Resolute response to that it's a little ambiguous that period between now and the election simply because Mal actors Russia China North Korea uh ET Etc will have a tendency to believe we're too distracted to respond that's one package of time after the election Scott um unfortunately I think we're going to have this inner regnum in which it would seem to me a at least a better than even chance of one side or the other if it's a close election which it appears it probably will be um there'll be a further series of legal challenges there could be unted EV like January 6th who knows that second period of time until the inauguration of the new president I think is a second and somewhat even more risky period so yes we need to be leaning forward you asked about the military the military is not looking internally but I assure you the intelligence agencies The Joint Chiefs of Staff the combatant commanders in position which I served for eight years two different combat commands they are looking outward to try and see any signs of risk directed against the country during these um very I think concerning periods from now through the inauguration let's talk about the Middle East uh on MSNBC you said that you believe there's a one and three chance at best uh for ceasefire and Gaza talk us through how you landed there number one the Israelis feel as though they have not yet completely dismantled the military capability of Hamas but they're close and um you hear that from even from prime minister Netanyahu certainly from the Israeli general staff so I think temporally speaking the Israelis are closing in on eliminating Hamas and I believe I've said this to you before Scott but the military Center of graad ity is actually not Hamas the military center of gravity is that tunnel complex 400 miles of tunnels the Israelis are destroying those when those are done uh Hamas loses its opportunity to train equip organize and launch attacks as they did in October so that's a a military equation that is coming to fruition I think that's pretty close so that gets me to still more combat opportunities and actions but uh probably the Israelis are getting in a position to to make an accommodation on the Hamas side what I see is a lot of pressure it's been insufficient so far but increasing pressure from both Qatar and from Egypt to get to the point of pressuring Hamas to take a deal I feel both sides are are kind of closing toward it um if you'd ask me three months ago I think I was saying about a one in5 chance now I'm up to about a one in three chance the the forces pulling against it um are in addition to the two sides we just discussed Iran Iran uh would like nothing better than to see Israel continue to be targeted as resources drain see this fighting go on Gaza so Iran is kind of pulling against it but I'll conclude with this um now the Iranians have had an election elected somebody I hate to use these two words in the same sentence Iranian moderate but by Iranian standards a relatively moderate candidate there might be a little loosening of some of those activities so when you put all that together it's not a slam dunk but I I think it's getting close to uh one in three maybe even a little better than that right now you referenced that one of the strengths of America I agree is that the our you know our good men and women in uniform basically say all right good or bad decisions it's it's the oval office's decision and we respect the the command and control structure here I thought it was really unusual or extraordinary that the IDF publicly came out and said uh we need to see an end of the war or calling for an end of the war that struck me as is as if like if you at some point came out and said to Trump or or or Obama you know when in a conflict it's time to end this I thought that was pretty bold your thoughts uh Beyond bold and from a US Norm perspective um that officer uh she or he would have been fired the next day um we do not uh want our Admirals and Generals no matter how senior opining publicly about what is in essence a political decision closest I can come to that by the way would be Douglas MacArthur five-star general a general of the armies Victor of World War II now he he goes through and is in charge of Japan all going well he comes back in command for the Korean War and ultimately the president Harry Truman had to fire him for his insubordination because he advocated ramping up the campaign possibly using nuclear weapons and attacking China um we're not paying the generals to opine about that in public so yes I was quite surprised verging on shock and and and finally I know the IDF extremely well spent four years when I was NATO Commander my other side hustle was I was in charge of us Israeli military to military relations so I was in Israel quite a bit became very good friends for for example with General Benny gance the former head of the IDF General Gabby ashkanazi former head of the IDF I can't imagine either of them while in uniform aining on that level of political controversy really shocking Benchmark the idf's capabilities and technology and Personnel relative to the other fighting forces in the Middle East or even say for example Russia the IDF has advanced technology I'll give you three very concrete examples one um they reportedly have nuclear weapons two the Israelis have among I'd say the top four certainly top five cyber capabilities offensive and defensive alike and they have a superb Air Force that has the ability to conduct long range bombing attacks has fairly good refueling although they're buying additional capability from the US nobody else in the region remotely is at that level with them what they don't have is massive Manpower um they're a nation of about 9 million about 7 million uh Jews so it's a limited Manpower pool compared to Iran uh compared to um any any other potential opponent in the region um they don't have the big pool of manpower to draw on but if you ask me which hand of cards would you want to play uh you know as a as a general or an admiral I'd grab the Israeli military it's a it's a jewel you mentioned the tunnels and it strikes me that every time there's a major conflict out of it comes not a surprise but a piece of technology that played a bigger role like we saw tanks in World War I but my sense is they really had their day when when Hitler you know rolled his tanks into Poland and was met with the Polish Cavalry and we saw okay tanks are better right and then we saw aircraft and jet engine you know all sorts of stuff radar um it's you said or there's two words and you said one of them that struck me that we're going to hear a lot more about in terms of military strategy and technology and Machinery one is tunnels and the other is drones I'd love your thoughts on that and if I if there are others that are coming out of this conflict yeah tunnels actually have been with us in Warfare for centuries but the degree to which Hamas was able to build this uh underground complex pretty striking given the restrictions on Hamas comparably the North Koreans have a very sophisticated underground tunnel connectivity system so yes tunnels I think are something that is old but is new again um drones let's expand that idea let's say unmanned so that means everything from satellites in space a satellite is a drone right it's an unmanned vehicle long dwell surveillance drones command and control drones um what you think of as Reapers and predators attack drones carrying missiles surface drones the Ukrainian Navy is using surface boats drones to stri Russian warships and drones go all the way to the Bottom of the Sea here's the third piece of the Triad that I would mention it's artificial intelligence and we're seeing the edges of that emerging now in Ukraine where AI is being used to direct these drone swarms on both sides of that firing light still very nent but as I look at the future of warfare it's unmanned cyber it is tunnel complexes I'm going to throw in Special Forces into that mix and above all it's artificial intelligence that will knit all of this together the truce that Biden outlined kind of this five step truce and it includes a re rebuilding of Gaza like realistically and I don't mean to sound like an nihilist or fatalist here isn't any truce given the history here just kind of ready to be broken again I I'm just I'm struggling you know I I recognize that you're a military man but as someone who's been considered for these diplomatic posts what do you think is is there a sustainable uh uh state of being there right now or could could there be one phrase that has always stuck in my mind from uh former chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Pete Pace was asked a question roughly along those lines and he said war will continue in the Middle East until the people of the Middle East learn to love their children more than they hate their enemies that's a very profound line and it gets to your point that is it possible to undo centuries frankly Millennia of bitterness particularly between these three uh competing religious groups in the Middle East there fabulous book about this written probably 20 years ago it's a great title the battle for God it's by Karen Armstrong and it's a book about Judaism Christianity and Islam and their seemingly endless ability to find their way to war and to bitterness and hatred um so the short answer to the question is um until the people of the Middle East collectively decide they are going to reject reject that nihilistic aspects of their religious bitterness and disagreements and free themselves from the past and the bitterness over previous uh jihads and massacres in camps and there plenty on all sides uh until that happens I don't think there's a quick solution now on a more positive note um if there is a pass forward I I think the table state are a reconstruction of Gaza I think table Stakes are a Arab security force not an Israeli security Force an Arab security force that takes over security for Gaza and third and most difficult for the Israelis to accept some kind of a path toward statehood I think if you could get in that zip code then you could build on the existing diplomatic relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors that's the point where the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia could come in Scott and bring a lot of resources to bear on this problem all those are uh possible but we we talked percentages before I think it's a one in 10 chance that we can really resolve this with something as simple as a five-step plan we'll be right back see since we last spoke a few months ago uh the state of play in uh Ukraine yeah let's let's catch up um since you and I spoke last Russia has been on the front foot um making some gains in the uh Northeast of Ukraine putting some pressure on the second largest city k um you could kind of see Putin with some air under his wings what has changed and how often do you get to put these words in one sentence the US Congress did a good job I'll say again US Congress did a good job finally having exhausted all other possibilities they did a good job in that they provided $0 billion in military aid which matches the roughly $70 billion the Europeans have put toward this project so now there's real Combat equipment flowing forward and I feel the momentum is Shifting back bottom line however is as I think I told you probably 6 months ago ultimately I think this will end in a stalemate it'll end uh probably roughly where the battle lines are now drawn with Putin in control of about 15% of Ukraine ukrainians will hate that but the quidd pro quo for them would be security guarantees a path toward membership in NATO probably in the three-year future and a membership in the European Union that's a a complicated problem boiled down to a few sentences but I think that's how this one ends up and therefore I think we'll probably see more stal may little bit back and forth on these firing lines through the fall us election that'll be the moment for a negotiation the elections are there's a there's there feels like there's a leftward breeze coming out of Europe um which is shocked people and I was reading about the elections in France and many of us were kind of celebrating the notion that it was great that they kind of the left Center left and then the far left got together and decided to coordinate to Stave off the far right and I think initially there's a feeling of Celebration but when I look at some of the far-left policies that I think the center left will have to accommodate they're they're fiercely anti- is my impression what do these recent events and elections and new parties uh what is the impact on NATO as an alliance moving forward I will come to that essentially tactical question in a moment can we just step back for a moment and celebrate democracy in the last month uh over two billion people voted in elections that from what I can see were were free and fair um and delivered some surprising results 900 million people voted in the Indian election and the outcome was kind of a surprise a body check to Mr mody um Mexico elects the first woman and the first Jew in the most Catholic and patriarchal country arguably in the Americas um in South Africa the ruling party gets a very significant body check in the European Parliament another 500 million people vote and it's a you said a little bit of a a right-wing leftwing kind of hard to read depends on the country and then you live in London Scott we see a a complete shift in the government there coming from the left and of course as you allude to the results in France now you can like it or lump it on a variety of those different candidates and outcomes but I say hail to democracy it's delivering um some surprising outcomes in some uh what appear to me to be free and fair elections that's a good thing in my view especially as we constantly as we should ring our hands about the authoritarianism in the world let's keep democracy in perspective as Church Hill said the worst form of government except for all the others so that's the Strategic Chapo terms of NATO it it's a it's a mixture of reactions that I have uh UK won't make a bit of difference UK is going to continue to strongly support NATO particularly having walked away from the European Union in France you're right to worry about the Tendencies of the far-left MCR I think has his strengths and weaknesses don't we all uh but he's he has come around on NATO um and I think he will work with the left to at least ensure that Ukraine continues to get support and that's the main ball right now Germany uh I think is going to continue to increase its defense budget Poland is now spending as much on defense as the United States on a per capita basis maybe a little more believe it or not um and there are other examples in the alliance so overall the elections are going to you know cause that transatlantic bridge to Creek just a little bit but I think uh as I look at the NATO situation going forward word um I I think the alliance is going to continue to be in a pretty strong position and and by the way I'll ask the follow on question well wait a minute Admiral what if Donald Trump is elected president you know someone who has talked publicly about pulling out of NATO I don't see it I think Trump um like all of us has strengths and weaknesses ultimately he's pretty transactional I think if the Europeans continue to increase their defense budget um and their spending goes up Trump would ultimately say yeah that's pretty good value for the dollar for us to stay with NATO so I I think NATO comes out of all of this um certainly not in a blaze of glory but as a pretty solid Alliance so it feels like going back to Ukraine there's some there's some winners right the I would I I would imagine the industrial military complex or weapons producers in the US are winners yeah I also imagine that China is a big winner they're getting cheaper oil and um all of a sudden you know they become an an integral crucial partner for Russia give us your read on China as it relates to the war in Ukraine and what that means in terms of everyone's favorite you know bogeyman the possible invasion of Taiwan yeah I'd love to um let let me start with a bit of advice for Vladimir Putin and um I despise Vladimir Putin you know you may or may not know I have 50 medals from 29 different countries the foreign declaration I'm proudest of is that I'm sanctioned by the Kremlin uh I'd put that at the top of my metal stack so I despise Vladimir Putin but um if I were going to give him advice I would say President Putin be very careful of your relationship with China you are about to become an extremely Junior your partner in that relationship and and think of it this way Scott you're the economist you sit in Beijing you look North what do you see you see Siberia this vast empty land space it's the size of the continental United States maybe 25 million people live there that's it that's Russia to the east of the Euro mountains here's what is there oil gas diamonds rearers aable land Timber fresh water you get the picture the Chinese look at that like my dog looks at a ribeye steak it looks really good Putin is really taking Russia down a strategic Rabbit Hole here in terms of how the war in Ukraine looks from uh Beijing you know if I were president she I would be scratching my head uh just over two years ago at the Olympics President Putin told his best friend for forever president she uh hey don't tell anybody but I'm going to invade Ukraine and in 5 days I'm going to sweep that country I'm going to grab that little comedian vomir zalinski I'm going to throw him in Le forto prison never to be heard from again and then I'm going to have control of Ukraine which is full of all kinds of wonderful natural resources oil and gas in the Black Sea huge agrarian Factory it's all going to be mine that's what she heard here's what he's seen he's seen 2 and 1/2 years of the Russian military stumbling around incapable of overrunning uh a nation that it should have swept in the first week or two before the Western Aid got there now Putin has missed the window to do that so she his first question is in terms of himself you know those Russian generals are pretty bad I wonder what my Chinese generals are like like he has no idea he hasn't had a general here he shot fired in Anger not a single Chinese General they haven't been in a war of any kind since a dust up with Vietnam and not in a serious War since the Korean War that's 70 plus years ago so the point is she has a lot of Doubt watching that he also has a lot of doubt about sanctions um he knows there would be sanctions imposed if he attacked Taiwan he's looking at what's happening to Russia so that's I think a second warning shot for him and thirdly if he's smart he's looking at how those ukrainians are fighting like hell you know I don't know if the Taiwanese will fight but I've been to Taiwan I've met Madame Sai the former president uh president lie the new president I've met their National Security team I've seen their military in training exercises I think they'll fight I think they'll fight hard and by the way that Island would be a resistance Fighters Dream It's mountainous wooded surrounded by water that's not an easy nut to crack across a 100 miles a very difficult sea so bottom line I think she is playing this one very intelligently he's getting tons of free oil and gas from Russia he's insisting they hard pipe it to the east to him so that can't be undone he is uh doing everything possible to create that sense of Junior partnership on the part of Putin I think he's succeeding at doing that and I think he's too smart to launch an invasion of Taiwan at least for the foreseeable future Admiral James stus is a retired fourstar us naval officer he is currently partner and vice chairman Global Affairs of the Carlile group a global
