all in on the business and then we come home and and don't approach the home life with that same level of diligence it's almost avoidance because the state are actually higher at home I'm actually getting chills right now I'm going to be a little vulnerable with you right now I used to blame a lot on my [Music] ex-wife so we just we just jump right into this and I thought a fun way to start the conversation would be a couple true or false questions to uh I don't know give the audience a little bit of a preview to what we'll cover in the rest of our conversation some fun fact about you you can either confirm or deny them but uh this could be amazing and it could be not amazing but Phil can fix almost anything in post production so I say uh I say we get right into it so Michael true or false you've had three exits yes well I've had two two exits you're working on the third all right so a little foreshadowing don't let that stop you a little foreshadowing there we go awesome how um true or false you have 12 kids no there's a total of 11 of us so nine kids and two parents that is awesome we're gonna get a little preview of some time management and work life balance later on um in our conversation and then final question one out of every 10 Chick-fil-A use your product so one out of every 10 fet 10 Chick-fil-A stores uh use our product pay for our product one out of every five stores connects their data to us one out of every five Standalone stores connects their data to us sweet well let's let's unpack this I want to you you are the founder of oneclick app tell us where the businesses out today I call this like I want to give context to The Listener listening in here um where's your Mr where's the team size at and then you as a Founder you wear a lot of different hats so tell us which hats are you wearing now and which ones have you taken off for the for the team that you built well it's actually been quite an incredible ride um uh the hats that I'm wearing now is now just fully CEO what a CEO should be doing even though I get dragged back into operations a little bit here and there but uh but I'm doing my best to just stick to strategy stick to sales and stick to what I do best sweet I love it what's the team size looking like today we have a team of about of about 20 uh and most I'd say half is international and half is in the US I love it and then where's your Mr um we are at about 80 latest numbers I believe is around 87 mrr sweet awesome well congrats pass the uh the million dooll Mark got a solid team underneath you and this is when it starts to get well it's fun the whole long there every every stage of the journey has got different challenges and things that you look back and and you kind of miss about each one but this is a stage when you start being able to work through the team it's a new ball game so I'd love to unpack that a little bit about what it's been like transitioning into that but before we get there how how' this start you I remember actually once you go ahead and give your perfect intro because I've love the way for for many SAS Academy intenses and conversations I love the way you introduce yourself and then tell us the origin story at One Click app yeah the bottom line is that I help Chick-fil-A operators sell more chicken and I do that through workforce management software I love it I love it I feel like I I uh you used to have a different version of the of the uh of the perfect intro and it was just too good not to say I help Chick-fil-A sell more chicken um which I'm a huge fan of um I love the work you're doing um so tell us how did it start like how didd you get into that uh really I was at the point in my life where I wanted to give back and I was uh I love mentoring Youth and I love mentoring and helping businesses grow and I was introduced uh to a young man named uh James finlinson uh two weeks before he left on a mission for his church and he was going to be gone for a year and his dad introduced me to him his dad and I were friends and I was also doing consulting and helping his dad build his business and he had this idea and he he was actually a team member at Chick-fil-A and he was looking over the shoulder of his director and saying uh why are you coping from a computer to pen and paper uh I think I can help you fix that and it was his first job and he was a junior in high school and his name is James finlinson and his dad was uh Jan fin Linson so I was introduced to him and I said hey let me see what I can do with this this you know while you're going on your mission and by the time he when he got back and with the help of his dad on the on the technical side we were able to actually build this company to over 84 stores by the time he got back uh and that was while I was still full-time doing other Consulting things and things like that and then when he got back just decided to go full-time and help and take the position of a CEO and help to blow this up what and what year was that how long ago gosh I think he's been back from his mission two years now Okay cool so are you guys Partners in the business yes all three of us oh sweet very cool um I started so my background I was in workforce management as well different in uh different industry for the physical security space but the beauty of being a workforce management product is once you get installed into the daily Rhythm retention is typically really high the challenge is you have to change the behavior of almost an entire company right um so talk to me about how you guys onboard your your clients like what how is the onboarding process changed how and where is it at today yeah for onboarding um there we have so many features that we really just boiled it down to say hey what's your biggest pain point or what are you talking pain points and then what we do is we do the onboarding based on those pain points and then we lead them in the direction of where all other features can be found and what they can they can do and there's a self-served knowledge base but really if we can just tackle the pain points because we are getting super overwhelmed with onboarding you know we have this feature and that feature and you can do this in the future and that thinking that in their brain they're going to say oh yeah maybe that maybe that maybe that but if we just uh now we just laser focus on their pain points and then allow them to self serf for other things or to get back a hold of us and to help them with training with other things that is that has uh helped a great deal and we've also moved uh onboarding um so it's a two-step process so so the salesperson actually does the initial initial demo and actually covers all the pain points and then there's another 45 minute onboarding from a customer success team member and then that's it they're off they're up on their own up and running and we help them to customize a few things but that's that's what it looks like today awesome so onboarded in in essentially one 45 minute call they can call back and get additional support how' that change from what you're were doing previously so previously we were doing unlimited setup unlimited work uh all this uh premium support and now we we've actually we have cut that down to 30 days and we say look you've got 30 days of our undivided attention unlimited setup unlimited Imports of your checklist unlimited anything that you want customized and then it's selfs serve or you can pay $49 a month to get premium support and that $49 is actually going towards an account manager that's dedicated for them got it awesome did you you recently went through I think maybe in the last year or so I remember you you posting in our our Facebook group for our our clients a a picture of your newly implemented scorecard yeah and I would imagine that your datadriven approach has led you to making some of these changes can you walk us through how you manage the business prior to a a scorecard and then you know the lessons learned because it's it's it's funny you know Matt and I it is the single most if someone's not using a scorecard no matter how big the company is or how small they are if we can get them to start using a scorecard the business improves it's like it is a it is as close to a silver bullet as possible the challenge is it's hard to get a company through the the there's all kinds like you could say hey Implement a scorecard but then like getting that data believing in the data you know looking at it every week it really does take an organizational um shift in values in decision making to install it into the business you've been through that help help help Shine the Light on you know be the voice for all of those that are like a I have a live dashboard I can go get metrics out of HubSpot when I need them or you know I check stripe every once in a while like shine a light on the impact that the scorecard implementation had for you guys yeah to tell you the truth it's uh it's really difficult to grasp the concept of a good scorecard unless you dive in and do it uh my SAS Academy coach vet was just incredible in helping us to walk through the process and we had to have about four or five different phone calls but now we have a dashboard that it's simple green yellow red that's it this is off track it's yellow let's discuss it let's move on we don't have to talk about anything that's in green right if it's red absolutely we're addressing it immediately right but also one of the connections that I made was that not only is the scorecard important but also tying it to the success metrics of the ultimate goal that you have for the end of the year the company goal that is like a critical component of the scorecard uh and that that really was a game Cher so that we can all visually see once a week know exactly where we are what needs addressing and and what doesn't save our time I love it obviously uh big scorecard fan over here I have a favorite question on this Mike that I ask everyone when you first implemented the scorecard I assume that you brought it like you brought the concept to your team so my question when you first implemented the scorecard what was the biggest limiting belief that you had to squash in your team members to get them to buy into the concept of using it to be honest our our team members are pretty smart and they could see the vision but the biggest challenge in implementing the scorecard was getting the right data and everybody being on the same page as to what data there's so much data and you can be so overloaded and there's like 50 things that you should chart to really make the decision to say hey you know what we're only going to track these top three things and that's it right just to just to get everybody to focus their attention on those top three things uh took took a lot of back and force and it's still kind of one of those things to we like oh we should be tracking all this stuff and then reain everybody back into that that that's been a mind shift I think in everybody yeah that's do you have like one key metric like a Northstar metric from a product usage standpoint that you guys anchor around uh so we've actually started tracking uses usage of the app so if any what accounts are actually using the app over 80% of a threshold that we have scorec carded or what what percentage are actually under that 80% and then we actually send an account manager after them if they're using less than 80% to try to train them on new features or anything like that to try to get them up to the 80% number that one is uh one of my favorites yeah you're warming Johnny's heart right now as the uh the key evangelist of the member at risk Monitor and it's the same thing though right it's like and it's so funny because we do the same thing in SAS Academy right like there I don't think that there's a I don't think that there's a level where the Simplicity stops scaling right simple will always scale and so at the end of the day if you can put the traffic light in front of your team and say this is how you prioritize your actions based on the traffic light usually that's the 8020 of Behavioral change it's got to be simple it's got to be obvious you gotta be able to manage to it so you're doing a good job there man that's awesome no thank you Michael what when you implemented the scorecard what were did you see that initial lift and performance from the team now that we had Shrunk the focus down to these three numbers and I think as you've evolved it to it's got a handful more metrics we if a if a Founder is struggling to get a scor card implemented we'll say hey let's go track three metrics to start we can just like how do we eat the elephant one B at a time you've got a few more U metrics pulling in there now but did you see that initial performance bump when you implemented the the process of looking at your performance metrics on a weekly basis I did actually but uh something has happened recently which has just been astounding we had an expert in the industry uh an actual one I would say it's probably one of the top mines and scheduling in the world who's actually worked for several Fortune 500 companies and he actually built the company of his own and sold and so happened or so happens that he actually lives just a few miles from our office and it so happens that he was actually looking to get back into this industry so he came on board and became the Chief Operating Officer his name was Daniel Higby and to be honest he basically said you know what we are getting rid of a bunch of stuff and we're just going to focus on sales and we're just going to absolutely annihilate it and to tell you the truth this month he's been with us for about three months this month we're going to actually bring in about a quarter million dollars just this month alone because of him just saying hey let's just laser focus he's been on the road as much we've both been on the road he's been on the road twice just he's actually going and making cold calls himself traveling throughout the country and I am too and he's basically re-energized the entire company and he's as a chief Operating Officer he's taken over all of that I'll tell you with with the addition of uh my executive assistant and with the addition of Dan Higby as the you know as a COO they have been game changers I know that he came in five years too early but we figured out a way to get him on and it and it has been incredible so that I can focus more on CEO level stuff to move the needle and all I do is I try to find a players and bring them to them I interview them I filter through them and I bring them to them and then we hire them and then we progress as a company it's just been phenomenal man that's funny it's uh you can hear a thousand times over that people are your most important it sounds sounds callous to say tool but people are the tool you got as a as a CEO it's hey to the degree that I can find the right person in the right seat business will grow when I stop doing that and you know the standard lowers we start to go sideways or or go backwards um and it sounds like you're having it's it's it's rewarding when you feel the the what happens when it clicks like how much easier your life got instead of solving all the problems that Dan has solved you solved the problem of let me figure out a way to get Dan into our world and that allows you to show up as a c as a CEO vers versus you and they firefighting on the front lines of all the challenges in the business so just a great reminder for um your role as a CEO bring in the right people and uh the business will progress as a result um you recently went through a pricing change you announced it us we were kind of checking through the the website tell us about your process for changing the price what' you guys do yeah this was a incredible Insight because we um uh we did a price increase about six months ago and we had a lot of uh fallout and we had a as we were traveling the country and visiting customers they kept telling us yeah you increase the price but now we've been told we've been asked by our operators to start looking for other Solutions because you guys are too highly priced and as we kept hearing that and and people started to cancel things like that uh Dan Higby came on board and he said yes I see the same thing and I think we need to do price reduction strategy everybody's actually feeling the pain of price increases we really need to decrease our prices so that we uh and the goal is to actually double our customer count if we can double our customer count by decreasing pricing then we're going to be okay and then we're going to be able to help them get through these tough times the recession uh increased interest rates and all that stuff and let's actually get them on our side so that's what we've done with the price decrease as now that we are traveling the country and listening to the customers and meeting with them in person they say we have never heard of a software company doe a price decrease thank you the percentage how much how much was it thank you for helping us out I believe it was uh um so our highest priced product was at $425 per month and now that one's down to $349 per month wow uh that's uh and then we also started it $225 a month and now we have a $99 a month package that that fits some operators as well so having a really well priced low price see my mentality before was I always want to be the Mercedes I always want to be the Ferrari so if you can't afford it and you can't see the value I'm sorry you know we can't service you I'm that's what I want that those are the people that I want to service we can still be the Ferrari but we can actually give them something to build up to and build towards and and it it it just has blown my mind how incredible it's been and how it's been received and how many new customers were we on boarding we're we're double possibly triple the amount of sales that that we usually get now it's it's in revenue or in client count both sweet that's a fun equation yeah I gotta ask though um so you like by the napkin math so you say it was a 25% price reduction on average give or take yeah like what was going through your head like what were you nervous about what was the fear there man because I I'd be terrified I was terrified and I put Dan Higby through the ringer and I and I made him crunch the numbers over and over again and explain it over and over again he fought tooth and nail for this strategy and I put him through so much hell uh and and I and I kept saying oh what about this and what about that I'm worried we're going to lose we're going to lose all this money we're we're actually going to be out of pocket this is like a quarter million dollar investment we're going to lose a quar million dollars as soon as we launch this new pricing plan he said trust me it's going to work we're going to increase the number of customers we're going to serve more customers we're going to give better service and it's all going to work out to where finally I just had to take a deep breath and say okay let's do it and and then once we pull the trigger it it has just been I think it was a master stroke of of strategy um and I've never seen anybody else do it and that he worked super hard to convince uh me and the rest of the the board to actually do is is uh as Kudos on him yeah so for the people listening to this who might have had this thought where they're like I think maybe I can reduce my prices but make it up in volume my question is you decided to lower your prices what were you seeing in your sales process or in your goto Market strategy that gave you the confidence that you could actually overcome the Delta with increased unit sales uh really that uh really that the entire team has been um the entire team has actually gotten behind Division and has actually bought into the fact that we're actually able to serve more people so as people calling in they're feeling better about hey we've got lower prices let me help you there's there's something for you here we no longer have to turn away people because it's one high price buy a Mercedes yes or no you can start at a Toyota now and you can now build up to the Mercedes if you want that is um I think the Buy in from the uh the entire staff has has been one of the key factors got it and so your top of funnel was pretty solid you were having a lot of calls and you essentially losing deals on Price is what it sounds like right and so this gave you a tool to capture more demand that was coming in right right and we also have strategies for our competitors they have no idea what's coming they you know they they have no idea who they're messing with but but there's we we have uh tripled our developer force uh and we um and we have got some features launching soon that they're uh if if it doesn't make them weep it's it's uh it's going to be close I love it thanks for the Deep dive there man I think it's it's super useful because I think that uh to kind of put a pin in this part the strategy that you ran and sounds like works really really well but I think there's a large percentage of companies out there that your fears might come true and so that's why I wanted to double click on what were you seeing what was your top of funnel looking like what was your team conviction looking like because it's not a decision to take lightly like you said no our uh so our we have a unique business to where when we started we had a monopoly inside of the Chick-fil-A operator ecosystem we were the only one providing an all-in-one platform to to do workforce management and it wasn't up until about a year and a half uh ago the a new uh a competitor came into play so I've been fortunate enough to actually have exited two companies that were either monopolies or or oligopoly where I had possibly one one other player or or a couple other ones so from that learning uh I've I've learned how this how this works I'm not exactly sure if it would fit for all types of of businesses but we we get free leads we get leads that come in every single day we've had more leads come in ever since this new price reduction strategy in the than in the history of the company company but the thing is because it's such a small ecosystem there's only three Chick-fil-A 3,000 Chick-fil-A operators throughout the country and they're all networked in together they're all in the same chat groups if we make a move positive or negative everybody hears about it I know yeah so it's it's really it's not that you can make a false move and then patch it up sometime later like it is it is really you have to stay on top of it it really is a unique situation um and and how and how we deal with communication with them I'm not sure if that answered your question exactly yeah no I think it does and I think uh I mean seems like you know how to pick your industry man that's a it's kind of a key component of this whole thing so it's a cool share yeah we don't pay for leads we don't pay for ads it's just all word of mouth and we have too many leads and and it's just awesome Michael has it been challenging to stay focused exclusively on Chick-fil-A and not go elsewhere great question like not not expand out to other Industries um it is a big risk uh to do that but what I wanted to do is when we when I decided to come on board and said okay I'll be a partner and I'll take over a CEO I said we really need to just focus on one Beach head and that's going to be Chick-fil-A if Chick-fil-A is actually the leader of service and sales in the fast food industry then we're going to do the best job that we can at servicing them and that's going to catapult Us and other Industries it doesn't it our platform doesn't just fit restaurants it fits a bunch of other verticals as well but this is this is the starting point and I think here in about a year from now we're going to be ready to actually catapult and go into other Industries but for now we're still focusing on Chick-fil-A it's a big risk uh I I know it is but I think the the timing is rice sometime in the next 12 months to go to other Industries well it's interesting I I it's not a well I guess it could be a risk but it's counter to we often times for early stage companies uh are saying are encouraging the focus down so it's it's funny that um I was just asking where the discipline comes from to stay focused on it's easy to have like a sales rep who gets a demo from a Wendy's or from a you know what you know any kind of comparable restaurant and just say hey Michael I really love to serve this customer can we do this deal like to have the discipline to stay focused on nope we're we're we're sticking in in Chick-fil-A I think is rare and what contributes to like you earn the right to eventually pick in the next Beach head but you don't get to you don't even often times we we start too broad we don't get enough traction to even survive to the point where you hire you know 20 people and a COO and have the the choice to go onto another industry or or segment inside the market so um just was curious where that where that discipline comes from yeah hey I noticed something that I just want to call out for people listening to this because you said some of in your description of this you said some of the most dangerous words that I think Founders can utter you said them in the proper context but when you were saying your example you said it could work for and I think we talk about focusing on a market those are the dangerous words when a Founder says but it could work for X it could work for any business it could work for all these markets let's go do like that almost killed my first company was me uttering those words branching out from something we did really really well trying to be everything realized that we kind of sucked and then reeling it back in yeah so you skipped all that messy part and just you know I think stayed discipline which is really cool um but it's a it's a big decision and I think sometimes Founders will overestimate the permanence of that decision they feel like they're they're taking out a chisel and like chiseling their Niche into stone and it's not that it's not set in Granite it's in pencil but it could be like for right now until we hit a few million bucks in revenue or until we hit these specific product benchmarks and then to your point Michael you make the calculated decision to Branch out like that's the right way to go about it and I think it's just it's so tempting though right it's like ah good work work for anybody let's give it a whirl it's just such a big decision it is super tempting they're they're our competitors and other other people that we've seen come into the space they want to be everything to everybody yeah they don't understand the importance of discipline and if focusing on one Beach head because that just creates so much chaos and if you're serving one fast food if you're serving even two fast food type of restaurants they have they manage their stores completely differently and they're requesting new features that doesn't make sense for the other one right and every single Niche is going to request features and functionality that isn't going to fit everybody else at a certain point you create a vanilla one that fits almost everybody and then you ride that wave but you're right the discipline in learning what to say no to at the right times really only comes through experience well something that I was going to mention is I I these may not be the right words but let me tell you how I feel about like Dan mortell and Johnny and Matt and your entire leadership s Academy is that I feel that you are uh not only in the no but you are past the no you are on the other side of no like just being an entrepreneur you know you're kind of like you know that there's a no out there but you're really not quite sure right you get to about a million a year you're starting to like figure out okay you you know a million to 5 million you're like okay maybe I I'm I'm in I'm sort of in the no right but then you get past that threshold and you're on the other side of No and then that's when you start Empire building right I feel like I'm barely getting to in the know if that makes sense and then I want to be on the other side of no to where I'm Empire building if that makes sense but I think that SAS Academy really gives me the recipe from going from though from one from the bottom level to the middle level in the know and be on the other side of now to Empire building which is uh I think the goal for everybody it should be the goal for everybody who's part of SAS Academy and that's the way that I see SAS Academy and how you've helped us now you've allowed us to be in the know and to know the recipe and to always tell us okay you're the one that's actually doing all the research you're the one that every time that we come together in a meeting or you actually have these um webinars and you have experts on them this is like the latest and the greatest that's going to help you to succeed you know learn it this this is going to help you now three months in Internet years is like it's years right if you go three months without being in the know you're you're behind a year or two already so that's how I see SAS Academy and I'm super grateful for what you guys uh do every day for us for sure man I appreciate you saying that Michael it's um I say say to the team all the time is hey let's let's go make new mistakes okay so if there's someone out there that's done this before let's go learn from them so we get to try new things and get to the New Frontier it's not very fun making the same mistakes that thousands of businesses before us have made like let's go get into the room there's a room somewhere just like there the the Chick-fil-A operators you talked about there's an operator out there setting the new standard like pushing to the New Frontier they're figuring out a level of efficiency and productivity that hasn't been caught before so I if I'm operating a Chick-fil-A I can choose to plug into that or I can just you know push you make the same mistakes that they've made years prior so you you mentioned at the top of the conversation how important mentorship was for you that you like mentoring other people my guess is that to be a great mentor you have had a track record like SAS Academy is not the first place youve reached out for for mentorship like can you can you tell me the role that mentorships had in your journey as a CEO yeah to be honest with you uh because of the painful past that I've had with my other two startups and because of poor decisions that I made going with this startup I decided you know what I want to become a better CEO I want to figure [Music] out excuse me exactly what I did wrong and how to correct those how to become a better leader how to become a better husband uh how to become um better CEO and also to know what the recipe is for Success today really those are the reasons why why I reached out to SAS Academy to say hey I'm I'm interested in learning more um uh so yeah I don't know if that answers your question fully yeah how do you how do you feel like your leadership style is evolved to be honest with you it just switching the mindset from being a manager to a leader because I'm a micromanager I figure out if you're not doing everything that I need you to be doing and and I need you to do it exactly as I would do it right but just switching the mindset from a manager to a leader and if they're doing 80% of 80% is freaking awesome uh at of of the 100% that you would have done great and they'll just improve over time and be and become even better just that mindset switch I think has helped me to become a better leader um and that gives me more time to be able to even study leadership more to gain more skills and Leadership to read more books and to actually improve on a daily basis I think that was really the Catalyst of buying back my time and uh and uh trying to become a better leader for and become an allaround better leader in the family in the home and in business all at the same time yeah I was just going to say it's such a key concept right I think there's two that you hit on that I want to just shine a light on for the people who are who are listening to this number one is that leadership is a skill right I I think that you can be born with leadership traits but I do think that leaders are made some people it comes more naturally than others but it is a skill that can be learned and developed and refined over time um and the second one is that I don't know I don't view lead leadership and management is like one superior to the other I think that they're both required skills and they're different but it's also I think something interesting you hit on is that it is a it is a a Time investment to manage properly and to get even the 80% let alone the 85 90 95 plus percent out of someone like there are key rhythms right there are ways there's coaching hours there's time there's expectations there's resetting expectations there's so many things that conversations and standards that have to be hel that it's a it's a real discipline and I think the best CEOs and you know both of you are in this category is it's like it's you have to be a good leader and build that skill and you also have to be a good manager and learn those rhythms and build that skill and I think that that motivating a team to Greatness truly is the intersection of those two things I've seen great leaders who can't manage for and nobody knows what they're supposed to be doing I see great managers who can't Inspire anybody to do anything and you leave a ton of opportunity on the table I think it's when you when those two things intersect is is where the the really cool stuff starts to happen you get small teams getting big outcomes you know to be honest with you you have to be willing to do hard things and be uncomfortable and make other people uncomfortable and tell your truth those are probably the the most important things and those are things that have been very difficult for me because of the way that I was raised I was raised and you know let's not make anybody upset let's you know if I can swallow the pain and be silent and not tell my truth I will swallow the pain and be silent right because I don't want to hurt somebody else's feelings so all of this has taken a long time to actually try to shed those and they still creep back in and try to shed those but it's a lifetime commitment but also I think in leadership you also have to be a leader of your body which is something that Dan Martell helped me to realize as well and really to tell you the truth I was 50 pounds overweight when I turned 50 years old and I made a decision that I was going to work out at minimum six times a week and minimum five times a week but I've been doing six to five to six a week ever since then and I was a single dad of four daughters three were still at home and uh full-time single dad and I was single for 10 years and I was looking for my perfect partner but that was the first Domino that I had to tip over and it ended up blessing my life in many ways to where I I married the woman of my dreams and she had five kids and I didn't care that she had five kids because she was the most incredible woman on planet Earth right married the woman of my dreams uh business has become a success and uh relationships I I my relationships have start to flourish my body is more healthy I I'm becoming a better CEO I'm a better leader and just sometimes just one decision and sometimes it's just getting to the gym every day could be the deciding factor between the greatest of life and the mediocre life and and I appreciate I really do appreciate Dan morela because I know like he's gone through a lot of trauma in his past and his childhood and things like that and I kept trying to nail him down I'm like hey what's the secret Dan what's the secret like what's that one thing there's never really that one thing but really what he said was you have just got to put in the work that's it you got to put in the work if you don't put in the work you're not going to get those results uh and there there's there are no better words and and and that has been a game Cher that would be we we've talked about two if there were silver bullets for improving performance we've talked about two of them today and that is one put a scorecard into the business but number two is just is uh tame the body tame the mind right we we uh if you I had a I remember I had a sales director a couple years ago who I you know both he and the business needed him to get to another level and um he leaned in and made the commitment to do 75 hard and every other area of his performance not only physically did he transform but every other area of his life was transformed as well because of that commitment to the discipline and then the confidence and belief that that that comes from from doing that there's something so transferable about what happens in the gym and and what we do physically to what happens mentally and the reality is we are paid to make great bets right if you're in a leadership position it's good decisions on people on Finance on strategy it's a knowledge game right and so when we have the the skills built in the physical domain that breed the confidence and the clarity and the energy to go win in the mental game like it's a a recipe for Success really hard to do it to be at your best if you're not also dedicating hard to be at your best mentally if you're not dedicating time to being at your best physically so man you said several things that um certainly resonate with with Matt and I and the culture of sass academy one that's very hard to believe is that you're 50 years old that is how are you now I gonna say now you started working out now you're 40 how the hell that happened well I'm 53 but yeah I I don't know I don't know how I I I see 53 year olds other 53 year olds and I don't look like them as as you got it's all that Chick-fil-A man It's gotta be what it is um well Michael let's you touched on it a little bit I want to spend sometime here another one of the core values of our community at SAS Academy is the integrated life and we articulate that by saying we don't just win in the game of business we win in every Arena of life um that is uh who we are to our families that's who we are to our communities that's financially um Health in every Arena we don't win in business there's enough out there and if you if that's if this is your game I'm not knocking it's just not Who We Are we don't sacrifice the other are areas of our life to win in business like we're going to win in every area and we're not going to make concessions um that does put a lot of Demand on our personal development on our time management which is why we teach things like the scorecard having an EA you know sweating every day there's all these mantras that reinforce the habits that have to be true for us to win in every Arena you are now a father of nine talk to me about how you what does the integrated life mean for you and how do you make sure that you're showing up in every area um holding the high standard I'll tell you it's it's uh what makes all the difference is my wife Lori she is an incredible individual but I'll tell you what this has allowed us to do it's allowed us to have her quit her job so she can stay home with we have four kids left at home it's not easy but we have the four kids that we have left at home we want to give them the best experience that we could probably not give our older ones as we were going through drama of divorce and trying to figure life out and all that kind of stuff um but also you know as I'm trying to figure out the concepts and the leadership how to become a better leader my wife from time to time says Hey SAS Academy was supposed to buy back your time so you you know so where is you accountable I'm like you're absolutely right I I will do my best to be home today at at 5:30 to help out in the home you know but I think if you you can't truly be a good leader in business if you don't step up at home and be a good leader in at at the home as well and if you don't step up and be a good leader of your body and and and of your spirituality and all that kind of stuff you just can't but and for me I was very fortunate to be able to find somebody who is just uh um you know Lori is just an exceptional exceptional partner in every single way and I can't tell you how how amazing that feels having gone through through challenging relationships in the past and to finally find that one person that's that that's just meant for me and I am meant for her that makes all the difference in the world and the support that she gives me and the support that I give her and and and really be able to communicate she's an excellent Communicator something I have never done a good job of I could not be the leader that I am today without having her teach me some of the things that I did not know we've literally gone to Tony Robbins she she hears me listening to to uh Dan Martell you know in mindsets in the mindset uh mornings and things like that and she says I told you that I told you that I told you that too you know she's very well read and and she's an excellent communicator but that uh if and and if you can just step up in leadership in the home it's going to affect your body and your business if you just step up as a leader in your business it'll affect your body and your home like they're all intertwined you can't do one without the other you pick up one end of the stick it picks up the other as well those are so critical to do all of those at the same time and step up for your for your spouse and step up for your employees as well I have a question though um I I mean everything you're saying is resonating super deeply I think we all know her like Minds here um when it comes to this stuff but and and I won't project on anyone else I'll just say this directed at me for a long time for me personally I found that it was much easier for me to invest in building those skills in the business and it it took me a number of years to figure out the way that they translated into the home like why do you think that is because I know I'm not alone there I just don't want to project that onto either of you too but I know a lot of Founders out there they can go all in on the business and all these rhythms and scorecards and meetings and I'm going to be a great communicator and then we come home and and don't approach the home life with that same level of diligence like why do we do that to ourselves I honestly think we do that to ourselves because we have built a value system inside of us that says success is in the amount of money I have in the bank account success is the big home and success is the nice car and success is what everybody sees me as being a success is if that makes sense yeah but it's it's but once you get there like I've had everything and I've lost everything my first experience in business was being bullied by the richest man in the world B bullied by a billionaire with in a multi-billion Dollar business and going through all those highs and lows um really gives you the maturity and once you get to that level once you get to the no or on the other side of no where where you're like you know what success has nothing to do with the outside stuff yeah solving the money problem is a great thing and that's a goal worthy goal for everybody never have a money problem ever again in your life but stepping up as a leader and and having good relationships with the people that you love is above everything else I think yeah I think you nailed it man and I think that you know I've heard this from Dan and a few other people I'm not sure where it came from originally maybe Garrett but it was uh essentially the the the the quote was money only solves money problems right and it's like so I think you're right that there's a there's de it's a worthy goal right if I want to achieve a level of financial stability where that's no longer a stressor in my life but you're right it's it's no Panacea it's no golden ticket to happiness right you can still be miserable and just solve that one problem and everything else is still a disaster right so it's uh that's interesting man the uh it's the other the other thing that comes to mind when I when I think about this question is I wonder if like inside it's almost avoidance because the stakes are actually higher at home right like I'd rather burn down a business than burn down everything at home and so it's almost like you push harder to go take the risk in the business to go figure out over there because it's like quietly scary to do that kind of stuff at home if you don't you know have that as part of your relationship it's a really interesting onion to peel back I'm actually getting chills right now I'm going to be a little vulnerable with you right now and um I used to blame a lot on my ex-wife and and I did for many years and it wasn't until I was married and a committed loving relationship with a woman who get get me and I get her that I was able to finally come to the realization that maybe it was me I did not listen to her I did not validate her feelings right I did not do the hard work to actually show up as a father in the masculine as a leader like I should have I showed up completely opposite it was like oh you have emotions that's crazy right that that's the worst thing you can do in a relationship but to be able to get to that point to where you realize and you recognize that maybe it was all your fault when you're blaming somebody else right I think that's next level and that's and uh and I think we all need to really analyze all of the experiences in our life and everybody else who we blame and try to figure what part did I play in that right man so good I say you know the one of my favorite books in Concepts is Extreme ownership from Joo willing and you the first time I read that I applied it specifically in the business realm but it took a lot longer for it to show up on my internal thought life to truly uh own how I show up in every situation like if I'm take ownership over every experience that I have whether that's in relationships with as I show up as a dad like default to it's it's my responsibility and and my fault they put you in a position I think when you can like really let that sink in it puts you in a position of power where blaming someone else makes how you experience every day someone else's gives them the power gives them the responsibility of am I gonna have a good day or a bad day am I have a good relationship with my kids or or a strained one and um it takes a while to like really get it into your internal dialogue of thinking through hey I own how I'm showing up in this situation I own how this relationship is evolving and the Dynamics associated with it and no matter how much you know I can wish and and push this other person to change the only thing that I can change is is me and how I show up in this scenario and um man Michael you shared a lot today that I you can you speak from a place of lived experience like the discipline of staying focused in your in your Niche the the willingness to trust and and lean on on your team the uh emphasis on on showing up and uh and putting in the work on emotionally and physically to be a better leader and I I just um from the moment we met felt like uh uh a a shared values and um like you were just you're part of the tribe and um really appreciate
