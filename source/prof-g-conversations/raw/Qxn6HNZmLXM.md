you want a mutually beneficial team that has diversity of uh work Styles well let me just press let me just press pause there and I think you're saying this diversity of what diversity of thought of income of visibil visible characteristics what do you mean by diversity in this case I'm really talking about the way that our brain works and our actions [Music] work Claire where does this podcast find you I am just south of Boston oh nice all right well let's bust right into it you have a set of principles that seres as a foundation uh or you believe serve as a foundation for a leader building self-awareness to build Mutual awareness say the thing that you think you cannot say distinguish between management and Leadership and come back to the operating system can you break these down for us yeah I wanted to start my book with principles I've developed over my career as a manager and a leader and I don't I think people should have their own principles and values but I think these can serve other people well so I I wanted to start with them the first one is the most important one it's the one I probably spend the most time on in conversations I have with others which is a lot of people think oh now I'm leading a team it's all about the team and the organizational structure and I would argue no it's actually all about you and what are your default settings what are your strengths unfortunately blind spots are blind spots cuz they're blind but do you know sort of what you need to compliment yourself you've got to build this the team that executes better than the individual parts of the team uh and that's going to start with you and so that's that's what I'm having to say more about but I talk about some exercises to do to understand those default settings and then what are activities you can do with your team to start to build Mutual awareness so they you operate better as a unit say the thing you think you cannot say is really a lesson I've learned that you're not going to move the conversation the project the company forward until you're in a position where you can take some risk uh and you don't have to say the highly controversial friction full thing but I think it's really about saying I think there is a problem that is unstated maybe that's an interpersonal problem maybe it's an execution problem maybe it's a macro environment problem but be the person in the room especially if you're the leader or the manager who is willing to name it and it's an easy easier to name it if you ask it as a question but uh if you cannot get that out on the table that thing that's in the back of your head I think you get stuck uh and I think people get stuck and and taking some risk with what you voice uh in terms of your own observations about a situation is critical distinguishing between leadership and management is really that I believe those are distinct skill sets management is knowable it's how do I get from point A to point B organize the people the process the metrics the goals and Leadership is is a little bit more amorphous but it's really setting a vision setting the standards the bar the system of values really and both of those are critical and what I find is people tend to default to one or the other sort of naturally and Founders are often in the leadership camp and I would say Coos which I've been are a little bit more in the management Camp often at a certain point in your career you're going to have to break through learning the other skill set or you're going to hit a ceiling in my opinion and then once you've learned both skill sets you got to know which one am I playing right now in the room because uh you may be thinking you're doing a management thing and you're really setting a leadership standard and you better call it out that way so that people know how to follow uh and the last one about the operating system is just as complexity levels rise whether it's in your organization in your life uh I find that it's easier to have a set way of thinking about how do I at a meta level structure getting work done and I think what I describe in the book is sort of this company building system that ladders up and down the stack if you will of I mean this is how Google uses okrs but like if you have a common way of setting goals if you have a common way of setting metrics of of declaring this is what this job to be done is you can then contact switch across a lot of your work your business if you've developed an operating system where you can drop in and out of it uh as a leader and an individual but really I I think this applies at any any level of a company uh it's people tend to relish the chaos of young companies and I am not one of them uh I more relish like how do we structure this so we can move faster I actually think good systems can create velocity is that what you mean by the operating system yeah the operating system is a way of getting things done and you you mentioned a few times in your book that you think that self-awareness is the number one skill that you look for in people but you but you say it's actually not present or you think it's present and about 10 to 15% of people are actually self-aware why do you think that is and and what does it look like or what does a lack of self-awareness look like I actually think a lot of people once they learn the skill of observing themselves and getting feedback can get more self-aware so maybe they start out on a low level as we all do in our careers right uh we sort of think I don't know if you're familiar with the David Foster Wallace Kenyan commencement speech this is water which is really about empathy and awareness but but it's really based on on this joke of there's these two young fish swimming in this Fishbowl and an older fish swims by and says hey boys how's the water and they're like what you know they don't know they're swimming in the water they're like that's all they know and when we're early in our career all we know is how the world we're like the star of our own show right and we we think it's all about us and and I think what wisdom is I mean for those of us who've been around a little longer is realizing oh I'm in this water and I'm in you know there are other people here and I might not be the star of the show and I think for most people I would actually argue you can close that gap which is my S my sort of perception of me like people holding up a mirror and saying here's how I experience you in a meeting when you're giving a speech when you're showing up at the dinner table I can close that Gap once I have some framework work s for understanding myself which we can talk about uh then there are people and this is where I think we're talking about the 10 to 15% who have a lot of trouble closing that Gap maybe they're quite defensive when they get feedback which can be challenging because that means it's hard for them to listen they're having a sort of flight or fight response to feedback which is normal we're animals it feels like a threat or they really just think you know I am this much more capable of this thing than I actually am and how would you know I mean the things I I argue is one I think those people who have that Gap are often frustrated in the workplace at end of the day they're angry they're exhausted they don't feel like their manager listens to them uh or their teammates uh their energy is taxed by being in a system that they don't feel understood in uh I think that often those people get a bunch of feedback that they don't agree with right that so like look for those signs are you frustrated are you angry are you getting feedback you don't agree with you might have a gap you might not and again it's not that I'm judging you as a person I don't know what's going on inside your head and your body but the perception of you is is a problem that you might need to work on and then if I can get people over that hump then I think you can get a conversation going and I find often those folks might be at the wrong job Scott like they're just pushing a rock up a hill and how do you get someone you trust that you can talk to about that yeah I want to talk a little what you just said sometimes people in the wrong job I I've been the CEO and founder of several small and then eventually when they become sort of medium-sized companies I kick myself upstairs or out of the company and I've always thought that firing has been underrated and what do I mean by that that is I found that the majority of the rhetoric put out in the public sphere is very much that if a person isn't performing it's the organization's fault or you need a better job Des description or there's something wrong with the culture and I was found that sometimes good people just aren't aren't working out and especially in a small or medium-sized company it's better to move fast I I just love to hear your perspective on when it's time to let people go I've been asked this question like what's your biggest change in your opinion maybe in your career over your life like people always say like what what if you changed your mind about I think that's probably the one that I I I've come over to your side Scott let's let's just say that I would say early in my management career I had a lot of belief that really good management and coaching could change the trajectory of an individual who's in a situation that's not working and I still believe in good management and coaching uh I I really do and I think that if you think about like a normal curve right the people in the middle of that curve you can move them and ideally you're moving them up to the higher performance I think the Challen is that if you're talking about someone on the bottom tail and maybe the bottom sort of 30% performance I think there's something probably systemic basically in their skill set in the role perhaps in the environment in the job to be done that's not working and it is a much better service I agree with you to have that I don't know if I start with I'm firing you but I'm going to have a very this is what I mean about say the thing you think you cannot say I'm going to have a very direct conversation which is like I am worried this is not working out for you and and we should be work like talking about a different path sometimes the different path can be another another role in the same organ you know in the same organization but sometimes you know they need to leave uh and it's better for them what do you think of the analogy of I've always thought it's a little bit management is a little bit like parenting in the sense that we overestimate the impact we can have as a manager um as a parent we like to think that we're Engineers whereas we're really just Shepherds we can take a good sheep and point it in the right Direction and turn it into a high- performing sheep we can take a meddling sheep and maybe take it to a good sheep but the Sheep comes to you you don't get to decide what the Sheep is uh the difference between employees and kids is you can't fire your kids at least I haven't figured out a way to fire my kids I almost now almost never hire on interview I find that interviewing is almost worthless and I think part of that must be because I lack the skills to discern if someone's going to be a high performer or a low performer based on based on an interview what are your thoughts on interviewing and what are the do you have any hacks or subtle cues that you look for in terms of the interview or someone's background that are either green flags or red flags I mean I think first of all there's some research which I think from parenting that I think applies and I'm with you I think a lot of it is nature not nurture but there are a couple of things one you can really influence your kids friend group the environment they're in the School the environment and that matters and the other is um you can teach them basic manners like you can say hey there's roles in the system and you're going to follow these rules of being like a civil human and so I try to rely on that and I think that's true that translates which is okay what's the team environment this person is in which is a lot more of the manager's job than people realize is it a high performing team because you're going to perform better in a high performing team right uh and also how you teach is not telling people what to do it's just like parenting your kids look at what you do not what you say and that's true of teams so are you setting an example are you setting a high bar uh but the question is really about interviewing and hiring and I couldn't you know like it's always interesting to me when companies get to some scale where they're sort of Outsourcing a lot of the hiring process to I mean I believe me love recruiters and the recruiting function is critical but one you got to build it really thoughtfully and two you can't have people abdicating responsibility for the hiring process us because that is everything and it is very fallible and so what are some tips well the first one is I think there's more science and hiring than art like people think it's an art like do you have a good talent radar is this question you hear and I don't really I mean I think there are some people who have better instincts out for 30 minutes with someone than others but for me it's about being really clear about what am I interviewing for I have a rubric of things I'm testing and I'm using the same test across ideal tens and 20s of candidates like if it's a higher volume role I can get really good at hiring for that role over some amount of time of testing the same questions maybe we give at at stripe we've often used you know please fill out like this sort of worksheet a homework assignment or sometimes we do a Roundtable Workshop session with them um for certain roles but one use the pattern pattern match and data is your friend what is an excellent answer to this question I have a few questions I ask on almost every candidate I know what good is when I see it the other is what we've already talked about which is I really test for curiosity and learning you know you say to someone tell me about a project you were involved in in that fa failed right and does that person show agency do they say oh yeah here was the project here was the role I played and here's what I learned about what I could have done differently versus the person who shows up and says that was a terrible project the scope was wrong and this teammate of mine didn't pull their weight right like you're immediately I'm like there's a red flag no agency don't believe they can affect the outcome I'm not really interested in working with them the person who's oriented toward learning toward getting better is the person you want to hire the other thing is in referencing some people think references are just like well they're they're reference so they're going to say good things but you know human beings don't like to most of them don't like to lie so you have to ask like really specific questions like is this person in the top 10% of anyone you've ever worked with because is the person a good worker is what you're trying to get at so I ran a Services firm a high growth a digital benchmarking firm called L2 and we grew it to about I guess about 150 people and then we sold it and we were very data driven and we're constantly benchmarking other people's data and then selling it back to them with insights so we used to track a lot of our own data and I'll say a few uh politically I don't say politically incorrect because it makes it sound like you're trying to be bold but just observations that I think people you're going to say the thing you think you cannot say Scott is that what's going on there you go that's it this is the hard conversation uh Claire so uh what I generally found in management was that 10% of the employees added 120% of the value and your job was to make sure the other 90% didn't screw up the company too badly and that the 10% that really drove value you overcompensate and their job is to manage and you'd like to think well we're only going to a players it's impossible to scale a company with just a players because true a players want a lot of equity want to start their own businesses and there's just not enough to go around to overcompensate the a players and there just aren't that many of them so you end up with a lot of really solid be's who are great and important but it's really you know I've always felt in every company I can identify the half dozen or dozen people to the whole shooting match and we would try and figure out what are the atmospherics or the characteristics of those people people and so we tracked pretty closely who were quote unquote the 10% the drivers of the organization success and we found three attributes and none of them we could write down because they would come back to haunt us first uh women our company was very young and we found that generally speaking and I think there's now research that I hadn't discovered that young women's prefrontal cortex matures earlier I felt like I had five or six 24 or 26 year old women who could be the next junior senator from Pennsylvania and while we had some very good young men they were just quite frankly a little dopier had a more difficult time reading the room that's not to say they don't grow into great managers but generally speaking our outstanding performers were predominantly women too they had played competitive Sports oftentimes individual diving um gymnastics and also third and this was really disappointing they came from Elite universities that the screening and the rigor to get into an elite University actually paid off so if someone had was a gymnast at at uh you know a female gymnast at Yale it was just an automatic hire and all three of those things feel wrong your thoughts I don't think they feel wrong I think the thing going on in the back of my head as you as you list those off is what if I were going to abstract up what's really going on with those those three categories um on on the gender one yeah there's some evidence that that women have like even 12% more prefrontal cortex which generally means they're a bit sort of higher executive function and better at context switching um and I think it depends on the work right like I I would argue as I've said before like you want a mutually beneficial team that has diversity of uh work Styles well let me just press let me just press pause there and I think you're saying this diversity of what diversity of thought of income of visib visible characteristics what do you mean by diversity in this case I'm really talking about the way that our brain works and our actions work and so that could come that could be developed in you because of some actual brain chemistry that could be developed in you because of your socioeconomic background because of your your experience as a of a certain gender or a race um or religion like I I don't I mean I care about that kind of diversity but I'm specifically talking about the best people I ever hired on my direct team were often the people who kind of irritated me in the interview they were so different from me I would ask them a question and they'd be like well let me think about that you know I'm more of a go go go let's get to the answer and they're like these thoughtful very analytical actually slow to decide people but they would they would be the break on my accelerator in the team with that which I needed they would say really do we want to make that decision right now are you sure right and like think about that being around you and so I think one is do you have a diversity of skill set again though it depends on your business model it depends on what the project to be done is right for the business but I think the competitive individual the individual at the elite University I mean it's interesting you say that because there's been more I've heard from leaders today especially of larger companies that they'd rather hire the top of the class from a real a good State School than the top of the class from an elite quote unquote Elite University and I think that again if we abstract up a level that's really about people who aren't afraid to work hard who are resilient who are who are going for it by the way those competitors they're going for it at a young age they're like I'd like to win right I'd like to organize my time to win and I think that of and top talent has a lot of internal motivation I mean almost always or else there maybe just like flat out freaking brilliant at the thing you're trying to build right they're either just like Geniuses at this thing or they are incredibly oriented toward success uh and I think you can test for that and I agree with your point though by the way it's very like hiring all a players I think would be difficult to execute but also I mean you know the story of I think it was the 88 you know Olympic team we we could put professional athletes in the Olympic first a time we put all these Allstars on the floor from the US and they and they lost I think they lost to like some tiny country because like a bunch of All Stars can be not a great team uh because the team is a portfolio of talent that needs to execute on different levels what is scale I talk my book's called scaling people what is it it is repeatedly delivering excellent work with different people involved and a lot of the people who do that are the carriers of the system they're not just the Stars dropping in and out you talk about team should be a balance of introverts and extroverts and there's a lot of research showing that EX Rovers get promoted at a greater rate that the person who speaks the most in meetings regardless of what they're saying tends to get more recognition more compensation what advice do you have I've always said I'm I'm paid to be an extrovert but I'm actually an introvert and that's why I got out of the services business it was just exhausting for me people take energy from me I don't get energy from them what would have been the right role out of the gates if you felt like you had contribution but you were just naturally an introvert is it to push the limits are the boundaries of your comfort level and be more extroverted or is it to find a specific type of role and what is that role that plays to the more introverted um uh characteristics yeah I mean I think that is I have actually thought about this especially as I think about my own and you talk a lot about your kids but like you know you see in your kids one of my kids is an introvert what's an extrovert I'm like mine too yeah um I think the answer is both and I'll explain it but here's the good news for introverts which is a lot of earlier career roles are a lot of individual work that you should be getting done with your own thoughts and your own self like I'm going to go build you know a model or I'm a I'm a young engineer before AI has has done all the coding and I got to figure out how to build this this Pro this software program whatever I think to celebrate that early career stuff involves uh some introverted work however to your point in order to start to show up as someone who has more to offer than your individual work you are going to have to push your boundaries on saying the thing you think you cannot say speaking up in a meeting asking a question I mean I I do think introverts tend to be deeply thoughtful and the thing they just have to work on is share the thought with someone who's not just yourself uh and you got to start working on that early because you are not going to be noticed just for building an excellent model or software program or whatever you're going to be noticed for saying hey think the model is actually wrong because these wrong assumptions right say it you got to bring it up what in terms of self-awareness under the age of 30 are there if you're coaching your kids when they're in the workplace and they're just getting started maybe they have three or five years at a company if they say Mom you're supposedly a pro at this help me figure out what I'm good at what I'm bad at and what I should be thinking about moving forward like are there a series of questions you would ask them to help them identify the type of role or type of career that they would excel in yeah I mean I think there's a lot of work style assessments you've probably taken some of them like mbti Myers Briggs or there's disc there's this insights Discovery one I like there's the gallop strength finder that's actually a pretty good one for younger people um but I I think that the the answer is one I already gave you which is like are you more sort of task or people oriented maybe I didn't and then are you more introverted or extroverted and sort of start to get them plotting on what do you enjoy doing I remember actually when I was a young person I had this idea that I was going to go to law school actually applied to law school and got in three years in a row and didn't go but so note to self you know maybe I didn't want to go but my mom kept saying to me are you sure cuz you really don't love being in the details and I was like what and she and she was trying to tell me the thing you as a parent see right which is like I see how you operate she also was a a college professor so she saw me do my schoolwork and she's like you're very good at the big picture of the system you know but are do you really want to read contracts and argue about three words in a sentence no and so how do you help your kid understand this is what I mean by being in the water when they're in flow and what does that look like right for them and and I think that the series of questions really have to do with what you energy what takes your energy away uh how often do you see yourself working with other people to build something versus working on your own I mean you're trying to get them to see the type of work and I don't think it's a particular job I think it's I mean you know the Scott when I think about job to be done it's really like what am I doing all day am I reading documents am I writing am I speaking and then helping your kids see where they are the most where they gravitate toward naturally and then how do they build some additional skills that become a job but I I don't think it's that hard because they've been if they've been in an educational environment and they've done group work they can start to see it's when you do group work that you really notice oh I'm really different like that other person shows up and tries to like tell us what all what to do and I'm the one doing it right okay so notice that we'll be right back you're a senior level person at high growth high-profile company is you're on Boards of the same type of company what are your thoughts on Dei in the corporation the role the role it serves its evolving role does it serve a role what are your thoughts so one the words diversity Equity inclusion belonging Justice like we've got a lot of different acronyms that different companies have around this programming have become tricky because they are sort of more they've lost some meaning uh because we lab that we put them as labels on people's jobs or on programs when in fact I would just as as any person who works in a tech company I would say let's go back to First principles about like these words and what they actually mean and here's what I would say I have already said to you I believe having a diverse team is critical to success in fact and and here's the thing that needs to go with it that team needs to be run well managed and led well and that is inclusion how do you CLA measure diversity I mean first of all I think it's difficult to measure some of the things I've already named to you which is sort of brain science characteristics individual preferences around extroversion or introversion but I do think diversity of experiences whether that is your race your gender your religion your your political position by the way like which often gets you know are you conservative are you more liberal often that gets left off some of those measures you can observe and we can rotate toward those sometimes overly so some of those measures are self-reported in some countries you can't ask questions about some of those measures what I'm looking for and here's one thing that I will add in which is I do believe and there's research for this so there's there's some interesting research on this which is one a homogeneous team so a team that is similar to one another will actually immediately when formed perform faster and better because what they have in is this thing called the common information effect which is finish each other's sentences they can finish shared experiences we both were in the same rowing team and you know whatever in our College um and but but that team over time will not have outsized performance they will have Speedy fine performance a diverse team when run with inclusive practices meaning I value your difference I am listening to you as you tell me hey Claire you're making a decision too quickly or you didn't think about this if I'm run with includ that those teams can have um 3 to 5x the performance uh Amy Edmonson who did the psych safety concept and she's a professor at Harvard she was involved in a study of uh intensive care units which I think is really interesting and essentially in because icus are basically run similarly in hospitals around the country uh and they're really obviously teams that are 24-hour care for people who are intensively recovering from a surgery very ill and those teams when run inclusively so same combination of people doctors anesthesiologists RNs PA as you name it uh have 18% fewer deaths Scott a team where the doctor's like I'm listening to what the nurse's opinion is on this patient or I'm someone who's like I think this medication dosage is wrong and willing to speak up those teams have you know fewer people are dying like that's I mean neither you or nor I Works in that kind of environment but I think what inclusion and belonging is about is is really excellent management and that's what I care about and I think the problem is building these programs I'm like you know no just build better manager development and training and have leaders who get that you can get outsized business results it's about business results if you in fact have more diverse inclusive teams the things you cited and I want to realize this is a hot issue and I think everyone chooses from a common sense standpoint chooses their words correctly when they're talking about this or chooses their wordss carefully but the things you talked about adversity of background different approach to problems with the issues they face political affiliation where they were raised quite frankly none of those are visible characteristics and today Dei has been based a lot on visible characteristics your ethnicity so my question is do you think Dei should move away from visible characteristics look I think that's part of someone's lived experience I think as you've heard there's I think the people who really do this work well immediately go to and by the way it's not just your VIs characteristic but also your socioeconomic background for example that really matters so the people who get it get that it's more you're not one thing I mean I I find that frustrating if you're like well you're a woman in business you know I get that's why why do people get frustrated I get invited to speak in events because we need a woman I'm like that's not who I am and why you should invite me right that is a characteristic I have and I don't think anybody likes to be treated as one characteristic uh of thems eles and so should should we move away from it we should add to it and we should not get overly rotated toward that being the whole ball game I think the problem again is what you and I just talked about which is how do you measure how do you self-identify and then I also want to step back and say something which I I've talked about not as much as I'd like to which is when you're thinking of being a leader of anything a team and organization your job is actually to build a collective culture right it is not to to rotate toward oh I yes I want a diverse team with a lot of different characteristics some of which are visible some of which aren't but what I'm really trying to do is build a shared vision and a shared set of goals and a belief in one another that we will be better together to achieve those things and I like I think we get too rotated toward difference lately difference you know and I want to identify as this and I'm identifying as that like identity politics right I'm like so not interested in that I'm interested in Collective and Community cultural fabric that leads to better results and if you spend too much time on individual differences you don't get there let me put forward a thesis and you can you know validate nullify or say I don't know I think in 5 to 10 years there will be no Dei positions and the Dei departments at universities and corporations will be disassembled and go away your thought I think if you think of it as a Development Area right which is like I walk into an environment I'm going to use an example there's a guy I'm on a board with we're on the board of a school and he was a football recruit from a very white middle class town in I think kind of Northwestern Massachusetts and he showed up at a school that was very diverse in terms of mostly more wealthier kids but socioeconomically diverse but also racially diverse and he was like Claire my mind was blown he was like I was this high school kid who didn't know what end was up in this environment cuz I grew up in this incredibly homogeneous environment and I was all about my Sport and he said and to this day I am a different person because of that experience I had living and and being in classrooms with these kids who were so different from me and I'm a better he's a CFO of a major company today and when I talked to him about that he's like I had a learning curve of how to operate in an environment like that and I believe there is a Development Area for people which is how do I to your point listen have empathy have understanding that I am different this is not we don't all have the same water and and so will they be called Dei departments I'm not going to weigh in on that but is it important especially as you're trying to form a company a school a community to get everybody on some level like you need a shared vocabulary right for operating and I do think there are roles to play and universities are compan which is Let's help get to a shared vocabulary and a development stage where we are not well we one recognize we all have biases our brains take short cuts and two how do we have a skill set that allows us to operate as one unit so as we wrap up here Claire what we usually finish with a similar question and that is what would the advice to your 25-year-old self be and it can be both professional and personal advice I mean I'm not someone who looks back and sort of regrets regrets things but I would say say one I wish I'd done a stint living abroad at some point earlier in my life so that's one regret I have and I made up for it sort of professionally by traveling a lot for business but it's not the same uh and two um I would actually celebrate my younger S I took a lot of risks professionally um I did not go do the regular expected job coming out of my University I moved to California without a job and got a job at Google I think I recognized my risk profile right like you think about it you're young I was very fortunate I did not have a lot of debt coming out of school which by the way is really fortunate that was a very lovely grandfather who helped pay for college right I my parents were teachers I didn't but I recognize I don't have a lot of overhead I don't have a lot of possessions I could take some risks when I was in my 20s and I took them and that's what I would would tell people like don't run like a lemming over the cliff at the jobs that everyone is running for to do the thing that you think is interesting that by the way is going to go somewhere in the macro don't just you know I didn't become a writer which I thought about I I just
