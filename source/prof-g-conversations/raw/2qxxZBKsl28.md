had we allowed Putin to simply walk into Ukraine a world that was already getting more and more dangerous would get significantly more dangerous in fact I think the failure to respond in 2014 in Crimea the failure to hold up red lines in Syria is part of the reason we're in this trouble but equally it's obvious to all of us that there needs to be a peace deal that it's not credible that uh Ukraine is going to be able to achieve all the objectives that its supporters have [Music] Rory where does this podcast find you I have just got to London in your recently released Ted Talk you advocate for a radical way to address extreme poverty worldwide giving cash directly to people in poverty give us that pitch uh for why we should just be giving people in poverty to straight up cash just before we get into the knb of it I think the important thing is to understand that there are basically two models in the world and it's caught up in this phrase teach someone a fish they can eat for Lifetime give them a fish they eat for a day and a lot of the fashion in International Development for very understandable reasons has been not about giving people things but instead about giving them training knowledge capacity building and cash is very radical because it's an action of radical humility you're essentially saying these people have a better idea about their lives and priorities than I do and I'm going to get out of the way and give them what they really want which is cash now why does it work and there we can get into the evidence on it the evidence very striking hundreds of of randomized control trials demonstrating the impact my guess for why it works is that firstly it's much more flexible I think the second thing that it does quite powerfully is it's generally much more efficient I mean if I give you the cash to fix your own roof in a very poor Community you can probably get it done for about $150 if I bring in a a nonprofit we'd have to bring in Engineers we'd survey your hand we'd procure your roof we'd do all these studies and we'd end up spending many thousands of dollars almost only for similar impact and then I guess um somewhere at the bottom of it is the sense that in many cases people already have the knowledge they already know what business they want to run they just lack the capital to get that business off the ground so those three things together I think are the the ingredients that that makes cash so effective your comment is I mean I think true insiders when you state the obvious but you weren't it wasn't obvious to you before you heard it and your comments really resonate cuz I equated a little bit to there's a Dei apparatus that's propped up or popped up across every University in America and I would argue that it was these these apparatus were appara whatever the term is were desperately needed 60 years ago 12 black people at Harvard Princeton and Yale that was an issue we needed departments to focus on the issue now they have huge apparatus of very well-paid people a lot of resources Harvard's freshman class is 51% nonwhite but these apparatus never go away and and the way I relate it back to this is all of these nonprofits represent a lot of jobs and a lot of people who make good livings and feel important and feel like they're doing good work and have a vested interest in quite frankly obstructing a simpler solution is devising it or positioning it as crass or as not that effective and do you see what I'll call the nonprofit infrastructure sort of getting in the way and being intellectually dishonest about how effective this would be yes um and I was part of that I mean I was uh I was the UK secretary of state so I was the the minister in charge of this $2 billion a year budget and thousands of civil servants doing International Development and I remember when people first brought this idea of cash to me that I said half joking listen I me what's going to happen to all of us right there are thousands of us employed managing you know we've all done master's degrees in agricultural economics we going to be experts on health programs and remote parts of Liberia if we're just giving people cash you know what about all of us right I realize that it's a sort of strange thing when you're inside of bureaucracy I'm only half joking and the fact that that's my immediate reaction suggests something quite strange about the way that the mind of the bureaucrat works so the majority of our listeners are in the US and for those of you who don't know Rory is the co-host of what is probably I would argue the best politics podcast in the world right now called the rest is politics I I'm going to ask you to do something that is nearly impossible but if you were to give Americans who have little or no sense of UK politics over the last 10 years can you give us the cliff notes on what has happened in the UK and what you think it represents and what have been the major sort of shifts around leadership and what the populace has decided and where you think the UK is headed politically if you will okay so I think the first really big date is at 2005 when 2005 the British economy is still bigger than the Chinese economy not very long ago that's crazy that's a great stat it's amazing 19 years ago the UK had a bigger economy than China and now the the Chinese economy is about seven times us so that's the first big fact our relative power in the world has changed very dramatically and it's concealed from us because we've gone from being the fourth largest economy in the world to being the fifth largest economy in the world but in relative terms the shift has been off the scale second date I think is 2010 when a conservative government was elected which has been in for the last 14 years and was only finally kicked out by a more left-wing labor government that came in uh just in in election just under 100 days ago and they came in off the financial crisis and their watch word was austerity so they tried to reduce the debt and deficit they cut government spending very dramatically and there's a as you can imagine a huge argument between conservatives and people on the other side about whether that was the right thing to do for the economy or not next date 2016 Britain votes to leave the European Union and that removes us from being part of a single Market of Customs Union with our largest trading partner next date I guess that matters is 2020 when we get into one of the most aggressive covid lockdowns in the world far more so than the the US I mean people were kind of shopping their neighbors for gathering in groups of more than three at a barbecue outdoors and we're still calculating the cost of that but it probably costs the British government about £400 million which is a significant sorry 400 billion 400 billion I'm sorry I got a, 1,000 off that 400 billion pound so a really significant chunk of government expenditure annually is be about a trillion right so about 40% of annual government expenditure was spent on the covid response and then the final thing has been uh demography so when we set up our welfare state before the first of War there were 20 working people for every one retired person today there are just under three working people for every one retired person we're living longer and longer we have a cradle to grave healthc care system that's getting more and more expensive in fact about 3% more expensive every year than inflation because of aging and the cost of drugs and our economic growth has been anemic our productivity has been flat since the financial crisis and uh you can imagine as a result of all of that you have a pretty cross population and a new government that's come in feeling it doesn't have many options cuz unlike the US it's not the world's Reserve currency it can't go and borrow a huge amount describe what you think will be the biggest changes of this new Administration relative to the conservatives over the last 14 years well it's very difficult to see that at the moment I mean it's it's very cosmetic they're closer to the unions and they've given significant public sector pay Rises as soon as they came in uh which of course has made the conservatives sort of delighted because it plays into their kind of cliches about leftwing governments they have however stuck with most of the spending reductions they've promised not to increase taxes they've promised not to increase borrowing how do they do that if they're going to increase wages how do they not increase the deficit or taxes um they've they've cut investment and that again is pretty troubling I mean they've stopped most of the rail and Road investment they've just canceled a big supercomputer that was being built in Edinburgh they've announced they're not going ahead with uh big programs to rebuild hospitals so I think they're in trouble I mean this is a a leftwing government that's come in after 14 years in which the British public are fed up with austerity and want more investment in public services it's a government that is trying to reassure the financial markets and felt that the only way of winning the election was to promise it would never put taxes up but now finds itself having won a big majority with its hands tied behind its back by This Promise so what I'd like to do is I I want to give you some observations of a bystander and that is an American who's lived in London for 2 years and as a means of contrasting using it as a jumping off point for contrasting the US and the little I understand about the UK but I'll give you some observations and I want you to respond to them the first is to the upside as an American here as a someone who considers themselves a progressive I find all the dumb arguments in the UK have been put in the past assault weapons well of course we don't have assault weapons bodily autonomy for women well it's not even a conversation of course women in bodily autonomy trans rights okay fine it's not a big issue for us we're not going to spend a ton of political Capital worrying about a second or a third bathroom so I really appreciate that about the UK my observation is that and this is a question I'm genuinely flx by the amount of intellectual property here the amount of intellectual Capital The Unbelievable quality of the education system I the thing I love most about the UK is my kids schools I just think they're fantastic and I think the universities here are incredible I've had the good privilege to or the Good Fortune to speak at a bunch of them just such incredibly bright people an amazing culture rule of fair play smart funny and appreciation for the Arts a global culture that appreciates other cultures and yet they can't get out of their own goddamn way and when I look at London I think there's no organic value creation the only people I know making money here are serving money made elsewhere do you agree with this that Britain UK still has all the pillars to be just a robust high growth leadership economy and manages to steal Victory from the jaws of defeat I don't know why your thoughts it's obviously the central question of British politics um and there's a lot of different ideology goes into trying to answer that question um some of it is is um is cultural so we have a big problem with developing technology and ideas and and then struggling to finance it and that seems to be partly about the risk capital in the UK I think another thing is that we have really struggled to unlock the potential of anything outside London and the southeast we've created a very unequal economy and and some of that is about infrastructure investment if we had decent Rail and road infrastructure connecting leads and Manchester we would create pretty impressive urb connation and we might be able to generate some serious productivity productivity in London Southeast is so far ahead of the rest of the country and then then we get on the ideology I think we're too centralized we should decentralize more I think we have um we've got really in our way when it comes to Planning and Building Things I mean one kilometer of Road one mile of road costs twice as much to build as what it does in France we're struggling to build housing and a lot of that is because we have this very very consensual planning system where people discuss everything for years and every n and argument good and bad for why houses shouldn't be built at a and very little gets off the ground so now do the US you're a very thoughtful guy give us your no mercy No Malice view of the situation in America I'm married to an American I have been teaching at Yale so what does the European notice at the US I think one thing is you have a really magical economy I mean there's something astonishing about what's happened in the last 14 years in terms of the Divergence from the Euro Zone we were almost level pegging in GDP per capita 14 15 years ago and US gross rates have shot off and you're doing it in a way that doesn't really make sense to us if I was being rude about the US your State education system is terrible I mean I've just been in Chicago the statistics from Cook County are beyond belief the majority of people graduating high school who should not be in any position to graduate high school in terms of their literacy numeracy rights and theoretically when we model these things you know smart people like you tell us that the way to create productivity is to have a great education system and all these people coming through but my goodness apart from the top apart from the kind of the cream of America these incredible Le universities the mass of people are not receiving good education and you know I got we also completely puzzled by healthc care and Welfare we're very puzzled by the fact that it just seems so rich but also so poor I mean go up and down the Connecticut Shoreline there are just boats everywhere I mean you have tens of millions of people who are astonishingly wealthy and then you have people living in Flint Michigan or in Georgia in conditions that we couldn't imagine in Europe so those are the kinds of things that puzzle us and I think one of the things that puzzles us most probably is that an election in Europe in the UK or Europe would be talking about the State education system it would be talking about public health and health delivery that doesn't seem to be what's dominating the election between Donald Trump and C Harris at all do you have kids Rory yeah I've got a two boys two boys how old nine and seven oh you're in the golden decade four to 14 are wonderful 0 to four we pretend to like it we don't once they turn 14 they stop love you know they no longer look up to you you become just this awful person that just get warrant eye rolls about 12 times a day you're in the golden decade my question is where if if they said Dad age 18 to 18 to 38 kind of the years starting my career getting going would you want them to live in the US or the UK and why at the moment I'd probably be tempted by them living in the US I'm afraid and it's a terrible thing to say because I'm I've dedicated my whole life to Britain I was a British politician I love this country I have huge emotional investment in it but it feels to me as though we are really lost at the moment and um and that's that's it's an awful thing to say but I'm afraid I understand why so many people around World want their children to move to the US I mean it just feels as though there's more space and to come back to the old cliche that there's there's more opportunity um but you know I hope I'm prove wrong I hope we can find our way through this malaise and that over the next decade we can get the UK back into a situation where I can say this is where our ancestors are buried this is where my house is this is where our roots are and let's make a go of it you describe democracy as increasingly fragile uh what do you believe are the key threats to democracy today I think the First Fundamental threat is that liberal democracies haven't been delivering well enough for people I mean that for about 200 years from the early 1800s it we could tell a story where we convinced ourselves that democracies were naturally more prosperous and as people became more prosperous they became more democratic and partly because of the rise of China but partly because the success of other authoritarian regimes we've broken the link in which democracies are not necessarily delivering for people and in certain years it feels as though non-democratic states are delivering quite effectively so that's one problem I think the second and and that is a big problem because I think the reason why people buy into democracy is not only because they believe in human rights and liberal values it's also because it was making them wealthier I think the second threat is I'm afraid social media I think it's not a coincidence that the rise of social media from 20034 onwards and its explosion with the Arab Spring in 2010 2011 is part of the story of the rise of populism and the rise of authoritarianism because I think it those are algorithms that drive people into polarized States and I think they are have been extremely bad for the key bits of democratic discourse in particular compromise meeting in the middle explain having a shared frame of reference what in your view is the impact on the UK and Europe of a trump or a Harris presidency Harris presidency uh I think doesn't trouble people too much it feels like a continuity of what went before Biden and we feel we sort of got the measure of where Joe Biden was coming from Trump presidency I think is going to be more troubling for people because it will encourage populists like Victor Orban in Hungary or Marine Le Pen who's this far right politician running to be the president of France to feel that they're entering a new age of strong men or strong women we would be worried that he would pretty quickly compromise with Putin in a way that would effectively give Putin power over Kiev um we would be concerned that understandable American Tendencies towards isolationism and protectionism would accelerate and we'd find ourselves facing significant trade barriers um and that the world as a result would get less stable and less prosperous we'll be right back so you brought up some geopolitics I apologize for skipping around so much here but while you're here I want to take advantage of this I'd love to just get your quick thoughts on the war and Britain's role um or nonr in uh the Ukraine Russia War Ukraine Russia um has flipped on its head in three very dramatic ways I mean initially nobody expected Russia to go into Ukraine and they thought Russia was going to definitely take k then they got optimistic about a counter offensive and now we're in a situation where the Russian economy is growing fast they seem to be able to mobilize a lot of people and they seem to have a lot of missiles and and Ukraine's survival is dependent on the UK Europe but above all the US putting in tens of billions of dollars a year and being prepared to do that again next year it's also dependent on our willingness to take risk in terms of allowing Ukraine to use weapons uh against Russian territory and making the very difficult calculation of how Putin is going to respond to that right the way through to whether he's going to launch tactical nuclear weapons is part of a response that so we were right to fight I think had we allowed Putin to simply walk into Ukraine a world that was already getting more and more dangerous would get significantly more dangerous in fact I think the failure to respond in 2014 in Crimea the failure to hold up red lines in Syria is part of the reason we're in this trouble but equally it's obvious to all of us that there needs to be a peace deal that it's not credible that uh Ukraine is going to be able to achieve all the objectives that its supporters have and I'm a huge supporter of Ukraine but that there needs to be some kind of negotiation the only hope is that they can do that negotiation from positional strength and momentum rather than from positional weakness the war in the Middle East war in the Middle East um well I think that too much of what Israel is doing is driven by netanyahu's attempt to hold his Coalition together and in particular hold smartr and benav on the far right of his Coalition on side rather than actual calculation about what is likely to lead to a more peaceful stable situation for Israel and what would that be let me just press pause there what if you felt there was a more a more thoughtful Administration what do you think what does that look like well it it has to move very very quickly towards reconstructing Gaza and it has to move very quickly towards some sort of path for uh political autonomy for Palestine and it has to balance that with Israel's security now that's not easy to do but we had recipes for what that might look like in the mid 1990s we still had those recipes in the mid 2000s and killing 40,000 people in Gaza and leveling that place I mean it's it's destroyed and now launching these attacks into Lebanon don't seem to me to be part of a long-term plan it it I don't see where that goes in five or 10 years time I don't see how that uh gets anybody to a situation of stability um and I'm afraid with the critics of Netanyahu on this I I I don't think his objectives his strategic objectives are achievable I don't think he can eliminate hammer I definitely don't think he can eliminate hisbah and if he can't he needs to find a path towards coexistence however difficult that is so just to play kind of Steal man this so with respect to launching you know launching this offensive I forget the words used against Lebanon what would you say to people who say well Lebanon has fired 8,500 missiles into Israel over the last 10 years this war has been going on a while and that the only way to have some sort of stable peace is to to quite frankly terrorize the terrorist and have a preemptive strike because it's not as if I mean I'm think about the pager detonations it's not as if these folks were trying hoping to give peace a chance and seem to be really open and bias towards a peace deal I I feel like it's a very American thing that okay we need peace we need a ceasefire versus recognizing throughout history the only way you kind of get in my opinion a stable peace through a war is to win it and that a lot of what Israel is doing right now is in my view I I think Netanyahu has been diabolical and a disaster for Israel but at the same time I think the response in Gaza has been fully warranted and um that the collateral damage there is horrific but is on a civilian to combatant ratio uh more Humane or less inhumane than any recent war that the West has prosecuted and it strikes me that when the media says that Israel has escalated the war in Lebanon I see them as trying to deescalate future Conflict by going after an an incredibly precise anti-terrorist operation in my view trying to preempt a future war that threatens their very existence your thoughts well that's definitely the view of the um people who back it um I just don't think it works I I don't understand how they think this is going to deal with 20,000 armed and highly experienced hisbah veterans who have formed up over 40 years who fought in Syria who have 10 times the number of weapons they had in 2004 including Precision guide Munitions short of a ground assault into Lebanon they're never going to be able to um tackle that and I think a ground assault into Lebanon is beyond them I think it's it's it's beyond Israeli capacity because hisbah is a much more formidable enemy than Hamas and their positions in Lebanon are incomparably more difficult to attack so they can blow up pages and they can destroy some missiles um but the idea that that is going to win a victory I mean that that's I mean in a way the logic of your argument would require them to win a victory so decisive that there's no coming back but they can't do that they don't have those resources they don't have the manpower to do that they don't have an option of wiping hisb off the face the map but let's talk about what are the options to just sort of sit and take it and hope that the Americans of the West come in with some sort of diplomacy like what is I agree this is it's it's a much more formidable fighting force what what what I guess what are the options here well the options from the very beginning of the state of Israel have been very difficult right this is a a situation in which Israel was created out of conflict and War and has existed through conflicts and War ever since I mean that's the has been the situation since the 1930s and I guess do I think that there is a military to that no I think the um the situation was best in the mid 1990s when they were getting towards an accommodation and when they were trying to be serious about what a two-state solution would be but I think this path of backing the settlers backing people in the I mean remember SM and bav don't uh want the existing boundaries for Israel they don't even want the existing bound of Israel plus the settlements they have a vision of a historic Israel from the Bible which involves displacing and occupying much much more territory so that there's no um path there I feel like it's unfair to say that without acknowledging that they're surrounded by people whose only constitutional amendment is the extermination of Jews so it's one thing to have I I think there's some outright far-right bigots in the knesset I think it's been a disaster for Israel Over settlements 100% I'm with you but meanwhile the only thing I can see resembling a constitution or a mission or a purpose statement about the houthis and Hamas is the elimination of Israel and the extermination of Jews so D to me like one is awful awful practices on the part of a government or Society another is a genocidal death cult and it's strikes me that this piece we're talking about that we'd like it takes two to tango and my sense is that Israel and the West have come to the table with some semblance of an offer that Hamas has said they're not interested in well I I mean this there's many things to unpack there I mean one is one is Netanyahu who's not been serious about any offer he has no interest in these P the the more fundamental thing this is a horrible thing to talk about and it's very difficult to talk sensitively but I guess the I guess the question is what is it exactly that Israel is worried about that they're trying to deal with here there was a extreme barbaric horrifying atrust in October but what actually happened there what actually happened there was a pretty low Tech assault across a very poorly defended border with the Israeli Army and security intelligence Services I'm afraid not competently defending that border if you're trying to fix that problem MH there is a hell of a lot that she could have done to prevent that assault happening and for the last 30 years there's been no evidence that Hamas and hisbah pose an existential threat to the survival of Israel nor what happened horrifying there was was not an existential threat to the survival of Israel what happened was a brutal horrifying terrorist assault with all that went with it and that's something that could have been dealt with I'm afraid by reasonable military security intelligence procedures at a border this is also where I disagree with the US's approach to 9/11 I don't think 9911 was an existential threat to the United States and I think the way to deal with it is to improve your intelligence security procedures not to think that you can some solve the problem once and for all by invading someone else's country so you are being intellectually honest I you know I would argue that you're sort of blaming the victim and the second worst day in Jewish history since the Holocaust does warrant a response and to your point when 2800 Americans were killed we went on to kill 400,000 Iraqis and afghanis and I would argue that in some ways that conflict set the stage for what's going on now and that is an unchecked Iran because we've taken out the buffer of Iraq so I agree with you to to have the Viewpoint you have on Israel would would need to require or augur a similar response on what you feel is probably an over response from the US a crazy response after 9911 it made no response I mean the problem is this is too emotionally charged for people on every side I mean I mean people have lost relatives they've seen images of rape and murder and there are hostages being kept so nobody's going to want to think about this in objective terms nobody wants to think about the long term nobody people want revenge and they want to believe the fantasy that there is something that you can do that can guarantee this can never happen again but the world isn't like that and that region isn't like that and the same will be true on the Palestinian side what they see is 40,000 people killed and women and children dead and they're not interested in having any conversation around this either because everybody is too traumatized I want to move to something lighter I don't want to I don't want to end on that so uh uh I don't know how to segue out of this I'm going to ask you do you very very trivial questions um the first is we're going back to our sons we have a lot of young men who listen to this podcast a lot of new dads what are your observations around parenting being a good being a good partner and being a good father I think it's it's very easy to say that you acknowledge that your children are different to you but in practice it's very difficult to live that out I mean the great wisdom is that these are very different human beings with very different characters and minds and they're going to find their own paths but there is so much in our parenting which is about trying to model the parenting that we received or repeat the parenting we received or to try to make kids do things which we enjoyed or read books which we like reading or become the kind of people that we either were or even worse trying to become the kind of people we wished we were um so getting out of their way and getting the balance between really testing them challenging them pushing them but also accepting when they're not going to be very good at something acknowledge when they're not going to enjoy something I mean I'm struggling with this in my seven-year-old I'm obsessed with reading books I read books all the time he tells me he doesn't really like reading books so we're in a continual uh standoff where I of course say to myself oh he just says that and you know I just need to find the right book for him so I'm the poor boy is now buried under 200 different books that I've tried to produce in the hope that I can and I come up with every kind of bribe and trick and Stor to try to get him to do these things maybe at some point I have to acknowledge that he actually when he says he wants to play football instead of reading a book he genuinely does want to play football instead of reading a book let me just say it gets worse I have the same issue around I would really like to inspire my kids to get their face out of their phones and to read more and for me it was in junior high school this great book series called The Great Brain about a young kid who is smart and funny do you know this I'm going to write that down oh it was wonderful um it was just really fun I was about a kid in I think 19th Century Middle America um and just his adventures and how he was always kind of and know was kind of very Mark twlight and then as I got into high school I started reading John IR Irving and I I just thought that was so wonderful anyways your turn what if I were to try and put a book in front of my 17 and 14y old that might Inspire them or reignite them their interest in Reading what are two or three titles you would recommend well I think getting people into really good uh short detective and spy fiction is a great way of developing people's literary tastes and skills while having fun so I think uh Michael Connelly who writes these amazing Los Angeles police detective procedural novels is great the the Harry Bosch series I think John the car's spy stories I mean it's a little bit more adult but he's an extraordinary Pro stylist uh there's a great French detective writer George seol writes very short books the MRE novels but I also think non-fiction is fantastic there's some great stuff written recently about well I I I think that youve all know Harari sapiens is a great thing for a young adult to to get into fantastic there's a an American academic at Edinburgh called Steve brusett he's written a great book called the rise and fall of the dinosaurs which I'd recommend it's a it's a lovely book because he's explaining some pretty complex stuff about paleontology through stories of his friends in Poland and his adventures and his so i' i' I'd be trying to ship that at them M I think historical novels can also be a great way through I don't know how young your youngest son is maybe a little old now but there's a series called the Young Samurai series set in Tokugawa Japan it's about 1600 did you see shun yeah exactly it's very much shun for children actually I read shun when I was 15 and love Yeah James claville I I remember that yeah I like all of those uh Rory Stewart is the former UK Secretary of State for International Development and co-host of the popular podcast the rest is politics he serves as a senior adviser to give directly a notable Direct Cash charity and as professor in the practice of grand strategy at the Yale Jackson School of global Affairs R he is also the author of several books including the places in between how not to be a politician and politics on the edge I could go on forever but the thing I found so interesting here is that he walked on foot for two years across Afghanistan Iran Pakistan India and Nepal in 2002 I could not disagree with you more on Israel but I find you are so sober and thoughtful and reserved in in and intellectually honest about your comments that it softens the beach for me and and while I haven't changed my view I do learn and I hope that more people are exposed to you and your views because even if they don't change their mind it it it just helps us all move forward and think all right there's got to be a way we can find Common Ground here thank you for your good work really enjoy enjoyed this conversation thank you Scott really appreciate it
