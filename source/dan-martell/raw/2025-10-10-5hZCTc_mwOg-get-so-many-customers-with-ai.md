# Get SO Many Customers with AI

Published: 2025-10-10

It's actually pretty easy to get more customers with AI because most people aren't plugging AI into their sales system the right way. I've trained thousands of entrepreneurs on sales and today run a portfolio of companies that will generate $100 million in revenue this year. And I can tell you that's only possible because of how we're using AI to get new customers. So, I'm going to walk you through the five phases in sales and show you exactly how to use AI to get more customers. Whether you've got a full sales team or you're doing it solo, let's start with the first phase, prospecting. What is prospecting? It's kind of like tapping people on the shoulder and going, "Do you have this problem?" They go, "Nope." "Do you have this problem?" "Yeah, cool. Let's talk." "Do you have this problem?" "Nope." See, I mean, at the end of the day, it's really that simple. Just finding the right people, buyers for your business. This one is like a no-brainer because it could be 100% automated using AI. To do this, just use any AI powered CRM tools like Manis.AI for ICP, which stands for ideal customer profile base lead list, meaning that you tell it what you're looking for. You give them examples from your current customer database and it will go off and do research all around your city or the world and it will find people just like the folks you told it to find. What's cool is you can even tell it to not only identify potential customers but go deeper and say who within that company is the right person to buy my software and find me the contact details. Oftent times I ask it to pull full social profiles cuz I want to look at their family situation. I want to look at their Instagram, obviously their LinkedIn and have that all built out into that spreadsheet. The best part for me is it allows you to focus on what matters more. Recruiting a salesperson, training the salesperson, you doing the sales call. essentially none of the mechanical work that once you do it once, if you figure out how to like identify a prospect and qualify them, you can give that to Manis as instructions and it'll go off and do that work for you 100 times, a thousand times, 10,000 times. You might have to pay for that version, but it is a beautiful tool and AI makes it automated. You might be thinking, well, that's cool, Dan, but where am I going to be needed in this whole process? Well, I use this thing called the 108010 rule, which is 10% ideation, 80% execution, and 10% integration. So, that first 10% is ideiating with my team or friends and figuring out who is my perfect customer. Then the 80% is giving it over to Manis and saying, "You go execute the research. You go find things. You test things. I need you to go do all the heavy lifting." And the last 10% is the integration where I might go through and I might just do a quick sniff test. Yep, that's good. Yes, that's good. Yes, that's good. The cool part is is qualifying what it found for me and feeding it back to it only makes it better. That strategy you'll see throughout this whole video where I like to plug in only in the parts that I'm needed because I think humans in the loop is actually really the competitive advantage. Right? As a director, I have taste, I have vision, and I have care. The AI can automate all the pieces. I don't need to do a second, third, 100th time so that I can have the time to actually talk to people. So now that AI has given you a list of real prospects, the next step is making sure conversations actually turn into customers. That's where qualifying comes in. Qualifying is doubleclicking on the person to see if they actually have the pain that your service can solve for them. The biggest mistake that people make in sales is to think everybody is a potential customer. Even if I've got the AI to create a leads list, it doesn't mean they're the right people. And for what it's worth, having somebody do a ton of sales calls and use that as like a metric of success. I did 300 calls today. When they're calling people that could have never bought, should have never bought in the first place, that's a vanity metric. I want to make sure that they're only reaching out to qualified people cuz that's what matters. This is a crazy story. I have a CEO in one of our companies called Revio. They do a CRM for sell by chat using AI. He had on his homepage where anybody could book into his calendar. At one point, he's doing 50 hours a week of sales calls, but only five were with qualified buyers. All we did was use your.com so that when people went to book in, it would first call them to qualify them to make sure they were even in the realm of a potential buyer and then only let those people book into his calendar. That bought him back 95% of his week so that he could focus on product and growth. I look at AI kind of like my spam filter, my email. It has the ability to block junk from entering in my calendar in the first place and fills it only with high intent leads. See, your biggest expense is just not doing the thing that makes you the most money. So, check this out. I'm going to do a quick demo with your.com cuz anybody watching can literally go there and do it. The first thing is I'm going to just pretend I'm a new lead coming in to that platform. All right, so I am at your.com. I enter in my details and I say, "Talk to the AI." You >> speaking with Dan? >> Yeah, this is Dan. >> Great. Thanks for confirming, Dan. How's your day going so far? >> Then let's say I ask it a basic question like, "How much does it cost?" I'm doing incredible, Emma. Uh, I just got a quick question about your platform and like just how much does it cost? >> I'm glad to hear you're doing incredible, Dan. Regarding the pricing, the investment details will be covered during a call with our founder who can explain the full value proposition and answer all your questions. Now I want to book a meeting. So it helps me schedule that meeting. Let's schedule a call. >> Great. Dan, let me confirm a couple of details before I check the calendar. Your name is Dan Martell. >> Yeah. >> Your email. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, you got all my details. Do you see how powerful that is? It is wild what it can do before anybody even books into the calendar. And that was all AI. No human involved. And it is always happy, doesn't take vacations, and never will complain. Plus, it can then also ask other questions like qualifying me a little harder, like what's my marketing spend or how big is my team? And the best part, everything on the back end is recorded, transcribed, and added to the CRM. So, there's no note takingaking, and it's easy to review my customer profiles. I can use that information later to have somebody else take over the sales conversation or for onboarding if they become a new customer. That's a great start to getting 10 times as many customers, spending time only where it counts. So now that you filtered out all the junk and you filled your calendar with real buyers, now we can move on to using AI in the next phase, presenting your offer. When it comes to selling, we have to present. Some people call it a pitch, some people call it an offer, but at the end of the day, we have to explain to the potential buyer how their problems get solved with your service or solution. And the more specific, personalized, the more information you have to present it, it's going to make you a weapon when it comes to getting customers to buy. Problem is is buyers don't buy features, they buy solutions, they buy benefits. And too often people are stuck just presenting a bunch of crap that doesn't tell them how it's going to impact their life. So what's cool is AI uses the record you've built so far. Think about it. the manis research and the CRM, the your atlas transcript of pre-qualifying any other data I could find on the internet and it can generate a tailored proposal for you to use on that call. And to me, it goes way beyond a simple template with a name swap. This is about a custom proposal. This strategy is so powerful that my buddy Simon, who has this software called HelloFrank. It's an AI for financial services, used it, the exact prompts I'm going to teach you, to present an offer in 7 minutes that generated over $100,000 in sales because it agitated the pain. It had a clear value proposition. It was so easy to understand. It was literally like the person goes, "Ouch, yes, thank you. Credit card." When you can describe your customer's pain better than they can explain it to you, you instantly become the expert and they're going to want to buy. So, here's how you do it for yourself. Create a new project and chat GPT and call it sales offer. Then, what you want to do is you want to upload the current offer template, your product and service overview, and all the information you have on that potential buyer. So, you can use that to customize it. So what I do is I create a separate chat for each potential buyer and I use this system prompt to generate the offer specifically for that buyer. And essentially I say combine the prospect CRM info, the transcripts and every other note that I have and use the template offer and output a personalized proposal addressing the pain points and priorities they express. For example, for Simon, we did this exact same strategy and then all I added is a little extra which I said present it using a VSSL video sales letter really agitating the pain. That was it. The cool part is not only does it give you the offer, it'll then give you the language in the script to use on the call with your potential buyer that really gets them connected to the pain and excited to buy from you. And as I mentioned, for each new prospect, you just start a new chat and you just upload the new information from your CRM and just ask it to do that same thing with the prompt. That way, you'll have a customized personal proposal for each new sales call you've got booked in your calendar. Now, here's a pro tip. A lot of new people starting in sales, the person goes, "Just send me a proposal." And they're like, "Okay, here you go. Attachment. Are you interested?" No, they're not. So, the trick is never send a proposal. Always schedule the call to review the proposal. The reason that call works better is because there's a humanto human conversation and you can hear in their voice if they've got concerns. You can ask them about some of the objections they brought up and you can also get a commitment on the call which you're not going to get over email if you just send a proposal. That's why we want to highlight your humanity where it counts and use AI to do all the stuff that you don't need to be involved in. Essentially, chat GPT outputs a personalized offer. You deliver it human to human. But here's the deal. Even with a strong offer, prospects will still have doubts. Here's how we use AI so we can prepare to handle any objection that come up without losing the human touch. Objection handling equals human work. It requires empathy. It requires courage to tell the truth. To me, the sale doesn't even start until somebody brings up an objection. If you do it right and you bring it up yourself, then it's an obstacle that you can overcome. If you wait till they bring it up, then it's actually an objection. Sales is not about convincing people to do stuff they don't want to do. It's about giving someone the courage to take a leap they already want to make in the first place. For me, AI in this context and role is about practice and feedback. So, the other day, my buddy Jake, top sales guy, he was dealing with selling a new product, a new offer, and he was getting objections and he was getting nervous because when they came up, he didn't have the script. He didn't have a process. So, it was clunky. I said, "Okay, bro. Why don't we just open up chat GPT, ask it the questions, and say, "Hey, here are the objections I'm getting. This is the offer. Can you give me questions to help the person see why the product or the service is valuable to them?" And we hit enter and it just went, it gave him five objections and five questions and talk tracks to respond to each objection. He said, "Wo, number three is really cool." Said, "Check this out. Give me 10 more. Enter 10 more objections, questions asked, talk tracks to guide the person to make the decision themselves. To me, Jake is the human. AI is there to give Jake new information to help the human. That is how sales is completely changed. To me, I'm always trying to help somebody understand the pain they're currently in, the potential future that they want, and then I'm walking them across that bridge, them handinand because they want to make the decision, but they're scared to do it. So, here's how you can use AI every day to get better at objection handling. The first thing is let's make sure you have transcriptions of all your calls or if you're doing sell by chat that you somehow collect that information. You want to store either the calls or the transcript in a Google doc. Now, after you got at least five or more, plug those into Chad GPT. You can upload audio files, it'll transcribe it, or you can copy and paste from a document and ask it to give you insights that you might have missed. The third is you want to ask it how you can improve in the future based on those insights. See, it has full context of the best sales trainers, the best information ever created in the history of mankind, and it can give you insights into your sales process. Here's how you really make it specific to you. You ask it to act like a world-class salesperson specializing in your industry. For example, a coach over sell by chat, a doctor that does plastic surgery doing consults, an HVAC person going doortodoor. When you give it the specific context, the answers and feedback it gives you to help deal with objections is next level. And lastly, you want to use it to roleplay. I'm a big fan of saying, "Hey, I want to role play with you. Actual buyer. Here's your scenario. Here's me as a salesperson. respond and interact with me so that I can get better at practicing my object and handling and at the very end give me a score or grade. I coach thousands of entrepreneurs on how to increase their brand and the media side and also get better at growing their business. So marketing and sales, the sales part is fascinating to me because anybody that's having a hard time with sales, knowing that AI can solve their problem, it's no longer a problem. If you don't think you're good at sales, that may be a fact, but it doesn't have to be true anymore because AI will do the selling for you if you just talk to it. Give it the information. Ask it to give you the questions, the talk tracks. Save that in a Google document as you're doing the sales call. Just follow the process. The difference between an amateur salesperson and a professional salesperson is the pro always follows the process 100% of the time. The cool part is you're still letting your human touch shine, having those conversations, being in the chats, but AI just helps you shine brighter. Now, once you've earned their trust and overcame their objection, it's time to close and start the relationship on the right foot. The next step is closing and delivery. So, closing, I don't even like that word. I like to call it enrollment. I like to have them join your thing, get inside your group, serve them, because to me, it sets the tone for long-term partnership, right? I love asking people, are you joining my team? You want to become a partner? Like all those things are sales. And then delivery is about once you got a payment, how do you onboard that customer as fast as possible? One of the things that I love to do is to celebrate other people. So in my agreements, when I start working with somebody, I say it in the agreement that once they achieve a win that they have to tell me. I literally make them initial it. That way when they get a win and they share it with me, I then ask them permission to share their story with somebody else. It's not for marketing, it's for them. See, I believe that if somebody's working with me and they get a win and they agree to share that win with the world, then it's going to hold them accountable to build momentum. And having AI do all the busy work, onboarding, creating accounts, and even monitoring for those wins allows me to do the thing that I love to do, which is celebrate with my clients. Everything you want in life is on the back end of a conversation. The back end of a relationship. The back end of someone trusting you with something valuable. Now, we got to put this in action. And I'll make this one super easy for you to do. First step is to go download the exact offer template I use in every single one of my businesses. Just hit the link in the description and you'll get it for free. The second is once you have that, drop it in your favorite AI tool. I like Chad GPT. And fill in the blanks for your specific business. Do that and you'll walk away with an offer so good people will feel silly saying no. Now, once you close the deal, you need to do two things immediately. First, once they buy, I want you to make them feel pumped. Ask them this question. How do you feel? Like after they buy, the reason why is you want to get rid of buyer's remorse. They might feel like nervous, excited, whatever. Just celebrate that. Just let them know this was the right decision and you're excited to be working with them. The second thing is I need you to get them a win as fast as possible. What I do is I send them three videos on my YouTube that I know will set them up for success right away. You might have internal documents. You might have another process. My coach Allen has this 16-day cleanse. Get some results very fast. That starts the momentum. That's human. That's not AI. The more you can design this where you're involved to celebrate with the human and not get involved in all the backend stuff, the better you are for your business. With all that, you're now on your way to getting 10 times as many customers. But remember, here is one thing that AI will never replace, and that's your humanity. You know, AI can only analyze everything that's ever been created by humans, but it hasn't done a good job for creating new things. Right? When I think of taste, being able to decipher what's a great song, what's a great meal, what's a great piece of copy, that part is very, very human and it requires repetition and experience in life to really get good at this. When I think of vision, having a vision for a life that doesn't exist yet, that should, that's hard. I'm excited because AI is taking care of 90% of the doing that I used to have to do so I can be in the driver's seat being a director talking to people. Buyers don't want to buy from a bot. They want to buy from people. AI will shift your time so that you can double down on what matters. The future isn't man or machine. It's man with machine. And sales is a very human process. And I know there's a lot of people out there talking about how it can automate the sales process. Trust me, the thing that's going to differentiate you from everybody else is your humanity. You showing up, being you. Use AI to do all the other stuff. Now, if you want to learn how to get ahead of 99% of the people with AI, click here and I'll see you on the other
