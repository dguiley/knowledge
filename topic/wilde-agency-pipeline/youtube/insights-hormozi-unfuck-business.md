## The Six Problems

1. **Serve Too Many Avatars** - Saying yes to anyone with money
2. **Underpriced** - Charging too little to scale
3. **Overcompensation** - Paying employees/contractors too much (rev share trap)
4. **Overextension** - Woman in red dress (shiny objects)
5. **More Overextension** - Growing for growth's sake (locations, products)
6. **No Data** - Can't improve what you don't measure

## Key Insights for Wilde Agency

### 1. Avatar Focus
> "If you get narrower in your messaging you will have a higher response rate from that particular segment"

> "When they see your ad: 'Oh this is just for me' rather than 'I might find some value here'"

**Application:** Two distinct funnels for two avatars (Venture Studio vs AI Transformation)

### 2. Pricing Psychology
> "Most people just look at the marketplace, take the average, and say 'I'll do more value for less money'... but everyone's broke"

> "You will get more noes but you can also make more money. If you double price and close rate drops from 30% to 20%, that's a great deal."

**Application:** Fractional CTO priced high ($15-20K/mo) as anchor. Don't compete on price.

### 3. Overcompensation Trap
> "When you're giving percentages of revenue... you can't business model fix it because if you fix pricing, the person just gets a free raise for no value"

**Application:** Be careful with rev share / equity splits. Structure matters.

### 4. The Woman in Red Dress
> "You will grow bigger by getting better. You will NOT grow bigger by choosing to get bigger."

> "If you want to make something valuable: start with the promise/claim. Everything after is removing friction."

**Friction = DELAY + EFFORT + SACRIFICE + RISK + INCONSISTENCY**

> "The iPhone is what's left after you remove everything that sucks from a phone"

**Application:** Don't add more services. Make core offer exceptional. Remove friction.

### 5. Before You Scale
> "The business has to go for 6 months without you and maintain or grow"

> "If you're not profitable and you add something else to become profitable, there's something wrong with your core business"

**Application:** Nail the model before scaling. Don't add services to fix profitability.

### 6. Data First
> "If you don't know what to do, you typically don't have data"

> "Measurement as intervention - if you track profit every month, it will improve"

**Two pipelines to track:**
- Click → Close (front end)
- Close → Resell (back end)

## Backend Optimization Insights

### Time to Value
> "What's the activation point? Look at people who are staying and paying - what did they do earlier?"

**Example:** Orange Theory found 5 workouts in first month = 8 months retention

### Reducing Churn Through Deletion
> "Number one reason people cancel across industries is OVERWHELM - too much stuff"

> "If I got rid of everything except one thing, which would you want to keep?"

Remove lowest-value feature. See who complains. If no one complains, you do less for same money.

### Ascension Points (When to Upsell)
1. **Immediate** - 24 hours after purchase
2. **First Win** - Time to first value
3. **Halfway** - Arbitrary but works
4. **Big Win** - Major milestone achieved
5. **Last Chance** - End of term (worst time, but where most try)

> "The loop is most open right after purchase. Keep the party going."

### Journey-Triggered Sales
- Map customer journey
- Define milestones that trigger closing calls
- CSMs get paid for qualified intros
- Closers get commission on sales

**Result:** 0-1 ascensions/month → 5-6 ascensions/month

## Quotes Worth Capturing

> "You grow through improvement, not by choosing to get bigger"

> "The woman in red dress looks attractive, distracts you from the main thing. If it's not the core business, it's been sent to destroy you"

> "Being in a rush ensures it takes much longer"

> "You only market to let people know about your stuff. If your stuff sucks, you want as few people as possible to know"

> "The profit is disproportionately made on the back end"

> "Build businesses back to front - solve how to make it unbelievably profitable, then outspend everyone on acquisition"

### For Offer Design
- [ ] Remove friction (delay, effort, sacrifice, risk, inconsistency)
- [ ] What can we DELETE from delivery?
- [ ] Define activation point / time to value

### For Sales Pipeline
- [ ] Track click → close metrics
- [ ] Track close → resell metrics
- [ ] Map ascension points in customer journey

### For Positioning

## Relevance to Current Decisions

### Pilot Program Structure
The "keep the party going" insight suggests:
- Upsell/expand at TIME TO VALUE not end of engagement
- Structure pilot so there's a natural ascension point
- LOI + milestone model creates that expansion moment

### AI Transformation Offer
The "remove friction" framework:
- **Delay:** We start faster than hiring devs
- **Effort:** They describe problem, we handle execution
- **Sacrifice:** They don't give up their core business focus
- **Risk:** Fixed cost vs open-ended dev team
- **Inconsistency:** Proven foundation vs vibe code lottery

### Two Avatar Strategy
Hormozi validates separate funnels:
- Venture Studio = funded founders (narrow, specific pain)
- AI Transformation = established business (different pain, different channel)

Don't try to serve both with same messaging.
