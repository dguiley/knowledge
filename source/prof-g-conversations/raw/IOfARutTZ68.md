let's just be very Dar winning about this seniors quite frankly are too expensive and not productive enough I don't know if you agree with that thesis but they're going to need to be less expensive and more productive if our society is going to you know maintain its economic Vitality if you will so start with the economics as was an economist I heard all about an aging society which is this there just more people aged over 6 to5 than there's ever been and that's a problem old people get ill they need a pension they don't work but we underestimate the capacity of old people [Music] Professor where does this podcast find you uh in New York actually let's bust right into it walk us through your idea of an evergreen agenda yeah so I think you know we hear a lot about Ai and climate change as these big trends are going to change our future which clearly they are we have lots of engaged debates about how we adapt and adjust to them but we really talk about something I think is incredibly important which is how we adjust to our new longer lives instead we talk about an aging Society where there just being all these more old people but the really fundamental change has happened is the young can now expect to become the old in the US 50% of children born today are expected to live into the late 19 late 80s and we're just not prepared for that length of life we have to do what I call a three-dimensional longevity dividend we have already have long lives we got to make sure they're healthier for longer and productive for longer and I think that's a great opportunity if we seize it but we're not currently set up to sees it so we uh we struggle so we have to be Evergreen we have to invest in our future uh uh because we have a lot more of it and it's never being as important to do so so give us the fundamentals of how you set yourself up for an evergreen future as a society or a country well as a society as a country I think there's a bunch of things to be done the first is we got to have a health system that really focuses upon Health uh we've got a health system that's done brilliantly are making us live for longer it's kind of slowed down the dying process hasn't slowed down the aging process and it intervenes when we get ill and that's a problem when you have age related diseases we got a system that says hey when a disease sufficiently manifests itself that it's causing you a problem come and see us and we'll try and look after you but with ag and related diseases once you get one of these things the second one follows very very quickly you know the United States around $112,000 per head is spent on Healthcare only around $350 is preventative uh so that's part of it the second thing is you know we hear a lot about social security problems uh but again looking at a systems level uh we both focused on making people work for longer by raising the Social Security age but right now people tend to leave the labor market from the age of 50 age 50 about 80% of Americans are working by the age of 65 it's down to a third and that's not really to do with people choosing to stop work they either get ill they have to look for someone they have to care for someone who's ill their skills are out of date or just ages them in the workplace so how we keep people working from 50 up to the state pension age I think is a really key thing Peter draer I think said demographics are Destiny and it does feel like it's a probably one of the biggest shifts in our society I don't know if it's immigration or but this feels like it's right up there and that is just economically in the US about we're about to go more than 50% of our government spending is about to go to seniors and also in the US 70% of Americans are obuse or overweight so what let's first start it strikes me that we're going to have to make seniors more productive let's just be very Darwin about this seniors quite frankly are too expensive and not productive enough I don't know if you agree with that thesis but they're going to need to be less expensive and more productive if our society is going to you know maintain its economic Vitality if you well so start with the economics as was an economist I heard all about an aging society which is this this is more people aged over 6 to5 than there's ever been and that's a problem old people get ill they need a pension they don't work but we underestimate the capacity of old people I we've got to stop doing that but I think the really big challenge is that for me we're focusing on the wrong thing because it's not an aging Society with its focus on a change in the age structure of the population the really really big change is the young and middle-age can now for the first time ever in human history expect to get old and we fear getting old we worry about outliving our health our wealth our finances our relationships our sense of purpose so we have to act now to age well so I an aging Society begins when you have lots of people aged over 65 a longevity Society begins you have lots of people who will live to be over 65 so I think we got to really think about this because if we're not productive for longer over our life and we live for longer we see a fall in the stand of living so you're right we got to be more productive for longer and that will of course involve more people working as they're older but it's more about a new map of life I think it's about thinking about a career that's going to last longer than before because you will need to be productive for longer but right now we have this notion that people get old at 65 and they're incapable of working which isn't true and it's certainly not true for everyone and for those of whom it is true we got to stop that happening for the Next Generation because as I say if we're living a longer life we want it to be a healthy one and we want it to be an Engaged one so let's go to the health side I'll put out a thesis obesity if we were to attack that we I mean that would be a good start but how would you how do you take healthc care from being a defensive industry to an offensive industry what you were calling preventive what are the two or three things you would want to see happen in terms of our approach to healthc care or Wellness so two or three things is the where it gets tricky first of all we as individuals have to do a lot more uh David Cutler from har Harvard says that the most underused person in the health system today is the patient themselves you know you say you're old you turn up and you get treated we have to take more responsibility for our own health that has issues about inequality which we can return to later but we just got to be more mindful of our own health in terms of the health system I think think we're at a world where potentially we hear lots of things about how wonderful big data and AI is when it comes to health it could be truly phenomenal because we can now do genetic screening very cheaply we can find out the diseases that people are most uh susceptible to and we again start to Target treatments so that we catch them early and keep them healthier for longer so that would be I think two of the major things there's big challenges the health system makes an awful lot of money from doing intervention so question of how we actually switch to prevention is I think going to be interesting uh we perhaps need to have a system that's outside of the traditional Health sector with its disease Focus that provides cheaply uh access to the things that we need obesity is a very interesting one I think what we need is a system that focuses upon certain key biomarkers you know things that say look if you got this this is a sign you're going to have disease problems later and obesity clearly is a huge problem um particularly in the US and the UK uh which stand out so how do you change that some of it is around public health and public health has been hugely effective in the past around smoking and drinking we tend to be very uh uh cynical about it now but I think we can do more in that area then you've got things like gop1 drugs oen pick and those things coming along which although my heart sinks a little bit because wouldn't it be great if we can get Behavior change to happen uh at least of the early evidence on those suggest they really could be a game changer in terms of bringing about future improvements in health but well let me let me go personal you're obviously one of the top domain experts in this world what have you done personally how how do you approach your Evergreen strategy your longevity what what are the things you do that you think your neighbors and your colleagues and your peers are not doing yeah no well I think what's interesting about all of this stuff is that you know you can you hear people out there doing these extreme lifestyle hacks uh I I haven't got the self-will or discipline to do that so I'm tend to do the the basic stuff I try and eat better I drink less I sleep better uh so all the the basic stuff and although that's getting a bit of a scientific makeover what's really changes my incentive to do it and know I at 58 I have to do things differently from my father at 58 and my grandfather at 58 because I had more future out of me so some of that is just just taking care of the basic hygiene as an economics professor I've probably always been mindful about money so I I think that's something that uh I I have been fortunate to be able to do some thing about but you know scottt one of the things I've heard a great deal about this topic took me a while to get it is we're living a longer life and what's the point of it you know you you can sort of starve yourself at breakfast you can do high and T training Etc um but there's a great quote by the Greek poet pindar which says the point of life is to become who you are having discovered what that is and that notion of adult development of of using a longer life to change and become who you want to be or to try and shift and to say who really am I and I think that's the really interesting thing about longevity you know my father born in 1925 was never a teenager he went from being a child to an adult at 14 we rushed adult development we're sort of extending adult development now I look at my children in their 20s and 30s doing things very differently from me but it's not just about that first stage I think we got scope to try and say actually what do I want to do and how do I spend my time and we're so hardwired to think of aging is about decline we've medicalized old age so I I do hope that that's focus on adult development and saying hey I've always done this but is that really what I want to try and do so for me that's the one I perhaps struggle with or focus on the most the very human thing about longevity I think you know the the extreme uh uh supplements and stem cell stuff gets out of the the real point of this is how do we spend that time you obviously you want people to live long happy lives um Society go into decline when their birth rate drops and and I'm going to make a very reductive thesis that as more and more of our of our revenues go to supporting and caring for seniors we lack the investment the forward leaning Investments that grow the economy the economy and couple that with inequality doesn't present a very optimistic future for young people they stop having kids and your Society becomes less productive you have sort of of you don't have I don't know what's the term it's it's not population decline it's population denigration and I I always hear this notion that okay we have to make our seniors more productive and this is going to this is going to sound aist I'm not sure they're interested in being more productive is that wrong well I think you know one of the things just like I'm not sure how useful it is to talk about people being old aging is a really diverse process and we have a rather monolithic concept of people after age 65 so I kind of agree with you it's not that all old people need support I think we need to be much more shrewd in thinking about you know for instance in London you get a free pass travel pass if you're over 60 that's kind of dared when you're an investment banker cycling to the tube station to go to work so we got to think less of Age is telling us something about people and think more of them as individual circumstances uh so I I think you know for me you're right though I think the challeng of Aging Society always becomes about Care Homes and adult diapers but the people who have the longest life expectancy for whom the The Standard Life Course is no longer working is the young I you know in the book I there's that great careta uh Scott King quote the failure to invest in youth reflects a lack of compassion and a colossal failure of Common Sense uh you know we the young are the ones who have the longest life and right now that traditional lifestyle uh of raising a family achieving Financial Security and having looking forward to retirement just isn't going to make sense for for them so I think we need some pretty profound changes but that's all part of what I call the longevity agenda because if the young have a reasonable expectation of living to a 100 my goodness how do they support that longer career but I do think we need institutions to support people doing what they want and your your point about the falling birth rate I'm not sure how much of that is Choice versus circumstance it does seem that people around the world want to have fewer children now I've got three kids I think I've been k is great but there does seem to be something about the world the modern world which is partly to do with expense you know it's you know it's it's expensive to raise a family but people do seem to want to have fewer children and I I think that's a really part of this fundamental change has occurred to us as humans we now have very long lives uh and we want to do things differently but our social institutions are set up based upon old ways of Behaving 100% agree with you on the the kind of the looking at Social programs through the lens of age is the right way to do it that social security in the US should be renamed if it were on a senior security because it seems like we're not just basing criteria on who needs it but based on age do you think they'll be significant changes in public policy that says in the US the wealthiest generation in history is seniors and there's still a huge problem a lot of seniors are retiring without money but one do you advocate for some sort of means test where they wouldn't a wealthy banker and you know 7080 doesn't get Social Security and also what do you think of these plans to give kids you know $7,000 on birth they can't touch it you treat them like infants and then when they're 65 based on previous market performance they might end up with a million bucks or something what do you think of these kind of uh what economic ideas or what public policy ideas do you think we should be more seriously considering well I I the other thing I'd say about the giving kids money at that age the asset management industry would love it but I'm not sure it solves the real problem so I think we tend to think the Aging Society story is about a pension issue it's really about how we create resources over our lifetime and finances doesn't you know the rate of return you get on the stock market depends upon the underlying performance of the economy now just to go back to some of the issues you talk about the economy I don't know a question I like to ask people is how much growth do you think in employment over the last 10 years has come from workers aged over 50 it's now the majority of employment growth in the the rich countries so in America it's 2third of employment growth the last 10 years as workers aged over 50 in my country it's 75% in Europe it's over 100% there's not much productivity growth these days so all GDP growth is coming from employment growth and all of that is coming from older workers so I think for me the key thing in all of this is how do we keep people active and engaged for longer and of course at 20 that might not seem important but the thing that's changed the 20-y olds now become a 50 or 60 year old I was talking to some Chinese students the other day and I was showing them China's demographics which are horrific compared to Americas population's falling number of people aged over 65 is going to be 45% and I said to these 30y olds how do you feel about all these 65 year olds in the future they say it's terrible all these old people that you know they get ill they need a pension I said who are they they said what you mean I said well who are these old people they said they're old people I said no they're you they are you in 35 years time and that's the really tough change because for most of human history the young haven't become old so we got to make sure the young age well in a way that is productive healthy and engaged and there's I think no policies around that right now government seems shocked when I tell them hey you know what a 50 four out of five people are working 66 in America only one in three are if you could half that decline that's a 4% increase in GDP every single year so that's a lot of money it's the nearest thing to a macroeconomic free lunch that I can find so you know that would be where I would absolutely laser focus on how do I keep people working from 50 to 65 and of course once you start thinking about that you realize that someone who's 30 in bad Health with obesity they are not going to be working at 50 so you're just you know storing up these really big problems you'd reference China and I read this crazy stat that I think when I was born the average life expectancy in China was something like 45 and it's now surpassed the US what has China done so right over the last generation to I it it has to have had the most remarkable increase in longevity likely registered in history no yeah and so what and that's why China's got this dramatic aging Society problem because it's had this dramatic increase in life expectancy and a very big fall in the birth rate in a very short period of time so it's got that huge change in the structure which America has got a much more modest version of kind of what's happening in America is that in the future you're going to have the same number of people of all ages from nor to 80 basically that's kind of where we're going to whereas China you know you got one child policy and you got one kid two parents and four grandparents which is just very unusual um what do they do right well they kind of did what everyone else did I mean one of the big things to do is to lower infant mortality uh and that's about nutritional intake of expect them other it's uh uh sanitation and hygiene all of that gives a really big uh Improvement I think as you have fewer kids you spend more time nourishing and looking after them you know we know for instance that parents spend more time with children now than they used to whether that's a good or a bad thing I'm not sure but they do uh so you know there they've done just very quickly what everyone else does I think the more challenging issue you raise is how does China with its GDP behead much less than America have higher life expectancy than America and America the gap between American life expectancy and what's called best practice the country with the highest has now increased to eight years and I think that's a staggering challenge you know as a macroeconomist if if US GDP declines it's over the headlines there policy initiatives to do something about it but this eight-year Gap now between us life expectancy in countries such as Japan that that's a sign that things aren't right but isn't it because it's poor people dying so we don't really give a well it's a lot about inequality I agree and I think if we could Target you know we found a we know aging is malleable um and if you have low income and stressful work and poor environment you age more rapidly so I you know one of the things I think is so important is to have a target for healthy life expectancy in a country and the moment nowhere in government or the health system is there a Target for healthy life expectancy uh and I think if we did have one we'd start to pay more attention to what would happen to inequality we'll be right back so I want to I want to Pivot to another topic you obviously you're known or you're you're you're getting a lot of press and warranted attention for your focus on longevity but you're a professor of Economics at lbs and I'm just I'm fascinated after being in London for two years amazing culture some of the best academic institutions in the world fantastic um or what I call institutions that typically lead to a very robust economy yet the UK hasn't grown in 5 years 7 of 10 IPOs of the last decade are below their offering price and one company in the US apple is worth more than the entire footsy I realize it's a multi-dimensional problem but what is it about the UK that it seems like it feels like it's doing something to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory that it has all the underpinnings and the infrastructure of what should be a robust you know growing if slow growth economy what does the UK get wrong yeah so I mean don't send us food Parcels quite yet I mean we're still sort of doing okay but yeah growth has disappeared as it has in much of Europe and it's striking you Europe led the way with technology and telecoms and now is so far behind uh you part of that I think in Europe is the the sort of whole single currency project which is bu huge amounts of political focus on making that work and of course in the UK we've had a brexit which has been in a very British understated way call it a a distraction uh and that's clearly not being very very helpful I would say the real challenge we've got around the world is that we've got Innovation slowing so you know even in the US uh this sort of measure of innovation macroeconomists have total Factor productivity growth is slowed down so you know there's not much productivity growth for all the hype about AI is going to take away all our jobs right now the issue we've got is we've got lots of people working unemployment's very low but productivity is very low so there's a shared Global problem um then demographics on top of that mean that you've got less population growth and you've got more old people leaving the labor force but I would say that brexit for me you know as an economist rightly or wrongly on the politics of of brexit on the economics uh it's it's not a good move to make it more difficult to trade with your richest Neighbors on your door step and at least that has short run costs and then I would say that we're also seeing some issues around austerity from the financial crisis we you know UK is kind of 25% European and 75% American these days so we also have challenges around inequality uh so we're seeing a lack of infrastructure investment and we're seeing problems around inequality and health and you I don't want to make it look like I'm a person with a hammer who's going to hit everything every sees everything as a nail but uh in the UK we have 3 million people who are unemployed long term because of health problems and a large numbers of those R 50 to 65 so that's one of our challenges we you know as you have an aging population Health has first order macro consequences um in general the UK's always been good at Innovation we're always good at inventing things we're just not very good at then scaling them and implementing them but no what do you think Scot you what what do you see from being there what do you find frustrating about British institutions if we've got enough time for that my observation of London is that there's not a lot of organic value creation that it strikes me it's a lot of people servicing wealth that has been created elsewhere let's look at AI some of the most impressive intellectual property around AI was developed at Cambridge and I mean it it it's literally as if they come up with ideas and I don't know if it's the they're not as risk aggressive I don't know if the regulation is overdone you know it's hard for me to understand it was a genuine question why the UK doesn't have a single company really that's worth over 50 billion in Ai and yet there are startups in AI that are you know get valued at 10 or 20 billion in the United States it's just just odd that that the UK doesn't seem to be able to commercialize some of the Innovation that they um they come up with I don't I I just can't put my finger on it I find the business environment in the us is can we make money together yes or no and in the UK it's sort of like a very polite definite maybe yeah no I I I you know there's there's there's that cultural thing that that's it's been a really long-standing problem in the UK that we've got you know an education system that is in some ways really unstructured which is great because you kind of have to learn things out yourself uh and that's kind of leads to I think rather unequal education outcomes but it's great at the top in terms of innovation but it's never fed through and then with a a focus on global Capital markets you get you know what we call the Wim wooden effect which is that it's very rare that a brick wins with the wimon tennis tournament but we kind of see it it's globally one of the best in the world and that's a little bit I think also the sort of the the implication of having a global Capital Market based in your home country do you think there's I read something that sort of struck my captured my attention I'm curious if you think there's any Merit the productivity PR your comments is declining and some economists are saying that the massive decrease in corporate tax rates um tax revenues from corporations in the US used to account for 3 and a half% of GDP it's now 1% our corporate taxes are the lowest they've been since 1939 since the Trump tax cuts and when you have taxes this low corporations have a really good memory they start returning more and more money to shareholders because there's less friction to get it out to them because it's taxed at a lower rate and they invest less and as a result there isn't the same forward leaning Investments and plants property and Equipment which reduces growth have we cut taxes Beyond kind of the ultimate balance if you will is that hurting productivity so I think you know certainly I would say in the UK that some of the fiscal austerity that led to Cuts in government expenditure around health and education has definitely hurt overall economic growth for sure on the corporate tax one I the reason given for that is that as we've made Capital more mobile as firms can just relocate anywhere around the world you've had to lower the tax burden on on it which means that you either have to increase the tax burden on labor or you cut the welfare state and and benefits and you know I think it does risk losing inclusive growth uh I so I think that is a challenge I I see the returning of money to shareholders less around Capital taxes and more around you know there's not things to invest in that produce that tangible growth and I think that's you know the example you know people always point to is uh you know when Facebook bought WhatsApp for what was it $17 billion they could have bought Sony for the same amount of money but rather than buy a company with 140,000 people they bought you know 35 mates getting together with a company and I think that's kind of one of the challenges we've got now which is sort of investing in intangible Capital uh isn't very labor or Capital intensive it's more IP intensive uh and I think that's why we're seeing a lot of money in global Capital markets but not a great deal of productive places to invest it in which is why we're seeing shareholder returns and low rates of return so just as we wrap up here I want to switch to Parenting you have three kids based on your research has it impacted the way you father or any kind of habits you're trying to build in or any things you're any practices or Lifestyle Changes you're really trying to endorse and and urge your three kids to adopt I could barely manage my own life so I kind of was reluctant to offer advice that other people's got but I I it is an interesting motivation I started writing getting this world where I wrote a book with a 100e life and I just lost my parents so you start to think about mortality and I was seeing my kids make very different decisions to me particularly my middle child who was just leaving University good University good degree he said Dad I'm not going to get a job and I was I was pissed you know I you know I and I was trying to work out why and there was a whole bunch of factors involved one was I think I was jealous cuz at his age I was working as an economist and Investment Bank and is my life in anyway shape or form better because of that no uh and you here he was good-looking young going to travel around the world and have fun I'd also was cross cuz you know I paid for him to get through college and I'd gone without holidays and here he was going to have a two-year holiday so that kind of annoyed me and I was worri for him but it made me realize that life is different people are doing different things and that got me thinking about Chang in the life course so uh if that's an answer your question it's like I can't judge what kids are going through I think we Define children by technology and all this gen z type stuff but actually one of the really big things that's changing is they're going to grow up with me and their grandparents around for a lot longer than past Generations so working on that intergenerational stuff is key and recognizing that hopefully they can learn from me but I can learn a lot from them as well cuz if I want to be Evergreen I got to think about about things in a different way and learn it and I'm unlikely to learn it from people who are my age doing what I do I got to be a bit more open-minded Andrew J Scot is a professor of Economics at London Business School having previously taught at Oxford and Harvard University he is also the co-founder of longevity form a Consulting scholar at the Stanford center on longevity and co-author of the global bestseller the hundred-year life his latest book the longevity imperative building a better Society for healthier longer lives is out now he joins us from the great city of New York in my in my opinion always fighting for the top spot with London and I a huge oversight I didn't ask you what your club was what football club do you support Professor ah it's private grief uh I'm a Spurs fan one of the reasons I'm Spurs son yeah absolutely one of the reasons I hope for a long life is I might eventually see us win something but uh we'll see yeah my oldest is uh Spurs I've probably been to a dozen Spurs games the nicest venue into the UK we got that going for us well let me know I've got three season tickets I go with my two boys they can't always make it so uh if you uh done done and done we love it well anyways Professor really enjoyed the conversation me too pleas talk
