as far as productivity growth is concerned that too has slowed down significantly despite some tech innovations that have taken place and now we are hanging our hat on AI boosting productivity but I think that the as I said that the capitalist creative destructive fiber of the economy has been undermined because we're keeping alive so much dead [Music] wood okay rasher where does this podcast find you I'm here in New York in Midtown oh nice well let's bust right into it in your new book what went wrong with capitalism it's really a critique of capitalism a capitalist critique of capitalism as you say so tell us how has the system been ruined yeah I think as I showing the book here uh Scott which is the fact that if you look at what's been happening in America pretty much a lot of the western world over the last few decades is that we have progressively seen greater and greater government intervention in the economy the suite of habits extends to just more than government spending government spending of the share of the economy has gone up from a century ago at just 3% when the government would do little more than deliver your mail uh to about 36% today but it's not just that it is if you look at the regulatory State we look at the impulse to bailout the uh proclivity to manage the business cycle just across the board we have seen a massive increase in government intervention in the economy with the consequence that it's destroyed the creative destructive uh fiber of the economy and productivity growth has been declining for the last few decades as well so that's the point I try and make which is that there are lots of perverse consequences that have come out of this systematic intervention in the economy and those consequences include declining productivity Rising inequality and also this feeling uh amongst most Americans that the system they have in place is not working near 70% of Americans want big economic change or want the current economic system to be Tor down so let's break that down so it's impossible to deny the government spending is you know not out of control right $7 trillion on 5 trillion receips um there's been unbelievable or staggering bailouts I think what 68 doll Co relief the only thing I would push back on or require or would double click on is this notion that we're over regulated my sense is that some of the biggest industries are underregulation and we've had monopolies form your thoughts yeah so again you let's look at the data right which is the fact that America is introducing 3,000 new regulations a year and that's gone up over time and I argue in the book that in fact regulation tends to be Pro incumbent and pro big business because when you introduce new regulations the existing people are able to gain the system much better get the regulations they want and also it makes it that much more expensive uh for new companies to come up so therefore it's one of the reasons I think that the number of startups in America has been declining right up until the pandemic we saw a big decrease in the number of startups in America over the preceding two or three decades so I would say that yes that we possibly can do with better Anti-Trust regulation which is what I think that you're alluding to but I think that we sort of have to see that in every industry otherwise we have seen regulations increase and that tends to hurt small and mediumsized businesses from coming up I know it from personal experience that the cost of let's say setting up a new uh fund uh is up 10 times over the last 20 years so that makes it very difficult for someone looking to set up a new funding breaking even compared to some large fund which is already there has the resources has the legal compliance departments to deal with all this so it makes sense that certain industries such as Financial Services where more compliance you know sarban Oxley what whatever you want to it just gets harder and harder and harder to compete um or to start up there my understanding is was there were more new business applications or permits filed last year than in history and two um it does seem though that some of our biggest industries have figured out a way to weaponize government or weaponized lobbyists but what you're saying is the majority of Industries are overregulation and this suppresses economic growth do I get that right absolutely so I'd say you know like and you're correct that we did see like a spike up in new businesses or so over the last couple of years but a lot of that was because during the pandemic many had to shut down so that's a bit of a which is going on that's not been the true Trend over the last 30 to 40 years uh so I think we have to keep that in perspective and the second Point as you say is that yes you know there has been some deregulation for example there's been financial sector deregulation which is why financial markets have exploded a lot but I'd say for most Industries in things like hospitality and things like restaurants and stuff the number of regulations that any small business has to deal with has gone up a lot and that shows up in sorts of ways for example if you look at the number of lawyers in America America's always had a very large uh legal population the number of lawers per capita is about the largest in the world uh but again that uh that this growth has exploded in the last 20 years or so so it's clearly in terms of who's benefiting and then and even in terms of lobbyists that you point out which is that the number of lobbyist in Washington the uh have been captured by all the big Tech firmm the big Tech firms dominate the number of new lobbyists in Washington or just total uh spend on Lobby so in your in your book you say in the 2010's economies worldwide began to slow why did this happen and where are we today yeah so productivity growth across the world has been slowing and so I think that that this is what in fact looks America a bit better which is that the productivity growth in in places like Europe has been slowing even more than what's happened in America but the point I make in the book is that's partly because they the kind of state intervention they have the regulatory uh fanks that they have is much greater than even here in America so that's not the right Benchmark but in general I make the point that productivity growth has been slowing everywhere in the midst of what is otherwise such a powerful Tech boom and this is a trend that predates even the 2010 it's been like on a decline apart from a you know like a brief surge in the late 1990s and early 2000s when you had the internet Revolution productivity growth has been generally slowing everywhere and I deal with this productivity Paradox in the book extensively saying that what could be causing this uh you know the all these arguments that it's because of mismeasurement and all but that's not true because when you know like in the late 90s on the back of the internet boom you did see a temporary surch so I think that the reason economic growth has been slowing a lot has to partly do with demographics that yes population growth across the world has slowed down that there's not much we can do about that but as far as far as productivity growth is concerned that too has slowed down significantly despite some tech innovations that have taken place and now we are hanging her hat on AI boosting productivity but I think that the as I said that the capitalist creative destructive fiber of the economy has been undermined because we're keeping alive so much dead wood I mean today the number of zombie companies as I say that we have in the economy today by some measures is close to 20% what do I mean by that these are companies that are defined as uh firms that have not uh or not earning enough profits to even cover their interest payments for three years in a row but keep going back to the market to refinance themselves and when we do that we sort of obviously undermine productivity growth in the economy yeah I'm a big believer that you need churn for a robust economy and that the incumbents don't want churn what just let me put forward a thesis and I'd like to get your response that one reason why we've seen a decline in productivity is because of low corporate tax rates and that is uh corporations have a memory and when they can get 80 cents on the dollar out to a shareholder they will choose to distribute earnings whereas if the tax rate is say 40% and they're only going to get 60 cents out and they get sort of a 40% reduction in the price of reinvesting in the company and planed property and equipment to grow the Top Line that the incentive is to or the hurdle rate for a go on investment is lower when tax rates are higher is there any truth to that well the evidence again doesn't really back it up right because if you look at what's happened in Europe you know whatever you know like the corporate tax rates have been higher they haven't been able to sort of get higher productivity growth either uh so I just don't see the evidence of that yes I do feel the fact that the tax system could do with a big overall I think we all agree with it there's too much of a disparity in the way that a W2 W earn is tax compared to how much uh cap you know like how much lower capital gains taxes are so yeah there are other distortions which I completely agree with but I think that in the book what I'm going to focus on is the fact that what happened to capitalism what did the founders have in mind is the system today what we have capitalism and why are so many young people in places like America disillusion with the world capitalism um as I say in the book that the surveys show that most Young Americans particularly Democrats say they would rather have socialism than capitalism that's a really big statement uh for a country that was the founder of uh for all practical purposes a capitalist system we'll be right back so let's assume that we agree that most people agree that we need to cut government spending where do you think we cut it so that's the point right which is that how do you prioritize that I mean what is the Biden admin istration done it is just doubled down on its spending so now it's spending on everything it's spending on Industrial policy it's spending on the chips act and I think on an individual basis when you look at government spending we all think that yes you know like in terms of each one is Justified uh but I think that the thing is we need to prioritize that don't we need entitlement reform should we really be spending on Industrial policy because the priorities are different if you want a welfare state if you want to give people lots of uh you know like in terms of uh even cash benefits as some people want to do I think it's about prioritizing that what can we do realistically and this thinking that debt and deficits don't matter because so many people for so long have been crying wolf about this right which is that in New York we have had these uh debt clocks which have you know been up for decades and it's because nothing has happened we think that what's the problem we can go on spending this way and we can and there is no real consequence to that and what I try and sort of show here is that yes there is a consequence one that because of this we have already seen a decline in terms of productivity because of the suite of government habits and two that now we taking this just to a ridiculous extent that America used to run a budget deficit of around 3% of GDP for the last couple of decades it was in line with other developed countries today we're running that at 6% of GDP way higher than any developed country in the world and our public debt as a share of the overall economy has crossed 100% And is uh only behind that of Japan and Italy and at this pace we'll be higher than Italy by the end of the decade so I think that the problem is this which is that the argument that debt and deficits will cause a crisis seems very stale now because nothing has happened for despite these crisis warnings for so long and there is this uh real confidence which almost B um borders on arrogance that because we are America you know the world will keep funding it we have the world's main currency which people use so they keep buying dollars and we'll never have a problem you know it's that kind of complacency and arrogance about you know where else will the money go it has to come here which sort of bothers me and and we were not that way uh and in fact I have you know still like a lot of great things about America but I think that what's happened now is that we've just taken this to another extreme so the Biden Administration calls you and says okay give us two or three things magic W you would want to see implemented right away in terms of policy or laws or tax policy what what would you what would those two or three things be yeah I'd say that in terms of I know that nobody listens un until they have a crisis so I doubt I'm going to get that call but still I think that you know let's think about it i' say that in terms of once you know like stuff is that think about every time you do a new regulation who's it hurting and who's it benefiting uh I mean I put a freeze on that I mean Trump tried something like that but it was a failure by the end because yeah you know he couldn't focus on anything so talked about not putting new regulation but by the end of the administration there were tons of new regulation which were going on so I'd say that in terms of focusing in terms of okay um some tougher Anti-Trust regulation yes I'm in favor of that but the vast swwa of regulations that are put in there really hurt small and midsized businesses so think about you know putting a new like new regulation two you have to think about the debt and deficits which is that don't have this callous attitude that nothing has happened there's been no crisis so we can keep running deficits we are at full employment in the economy and we have a 6% budget deficit uh already imagine if you have a downturn it'll be 9 or 10% so I would say that in terms of you know the open-ended chip S Industrial policy we need to put a check on that and I think that the other thing that I would say also is the fact that to make a very clear statement that we're not going to bail out companies at the slightest hint of trouble I mean you know that that statement needs to goes out because today you speak to people in private in the private Equity world or other places there is this implicit assumption that you know what the hell we'll give it a punt and if it doesn't work yeah I mean you know the government's there to back us out so uh that sort of thinking has to go away um so these are just broad points I would say at this uh stage that you need to think about moral hazard so uh you rasher you have done a great deal of work on India can you give us uh I would love for you just to sort of give us the cliff notes on the Indian economy and what you think the prospects are for the Indian economy over the next several years yeah so in fact I begin this book like in the prologue by speaking about my journey from India because as you say I was born there and I and India was a truly social economy when I was born in in the 19 uh in the mid 1970s and so I saw what socialism could do but fortunately for India after especially it faced an economic crisis in 1991 it's progressively been getting Freer progressively been moving up the indices of economic freedom and so therefore you know like I I've been much more optimistic about the economy as that's happened but my favorite line about India that I came up with a few years ago is that this is a country that consistently disappoints The Optimist and the pessimist so there's a lot of optimism I have but I would keep it in check to know that this is a pretty complex country it's not a homogeneous country like China which Moves In One Direction it's very heterogeneous very diverse so you got different things and different You Know Places which play itself out but generally I remain optimistic I see that the trajectory is positive and of course we can't not have this conversation and speak about the landmark election result and you know that was a very hopeful sign which is the fact that it's a country you know which believes in its democratic tradition and I think that that's something which also helps in the long term because this is a lot of research that I've done that you know like under Modi there was a real fear that India was moving towards an authoritarian uh Direction now you'll argue maybe that's good for its economy because you're moving in an authoritarian direction and you can take tougher decisions but the research I've done on this is the fact that uh authoritarian regimes you end up get either getting very good economic outcomes for a while or you end up getting disastrous economic outcomes because there's no one to tell you you know when you go wrong and I think that there was a risk that India was moving in that direction there's more checks and balances here and typically over time democracies tend to compound much better in terms of growth rates than authoritarian regimes do so I feel relatively optimistic about India yes there'll be some sort of bitter fights politically after the election result last week where the opposition feels emboldened but I think that you know it's moving in the right direction the only thing I'll keep in check is expectation that this is no next China which is going to grow at 9 or 10% it's going to be more like a 6 7% Tye growth rate at best that we in India for the foreseeable future so now do UK I live in London and IID just be curious uh you obviously spent a lot of time thinking about you know how your title 10 rolles for successful Nations and breakout nations in pursuit of the next economic Miracle let's assume this is not going to be an economic miracle I think that ship is sailed but what what rules are they following or breaking or not adhering to when we talk about successful Nations well unfortunately I think that Uki doesn't rank well you know because uh as you rightly say that I I maintain this ranking of these you know like of all these countries and you know where they rank on these uh various metrics and in the Anglo-Saxon world of course the the country that has been doing the worst which I think you know a bit of a surprise and I wrote about that is Canada that's been the worst really of the last you know 10 15 years and then next comes UK then Australia and the US compared to these countries has been doing relatively better and that's the irony of it uh you know in terms of all the problems we've spoken about in America but in terms of all the problems we spoke about in America in terms of are much more severe in places like UK like in terms of you know what it's been doing with its deficits although America now has overtaken it in terms of you know what it's been doing uh in the number of zombie companies so I'd say that in that regard UK in fact ranks even worse than America on most metrics so isn't it's really fascinating Australia Canada and the UK uh not doing well so take them add in the US aren we all guilty of overspending um capitalism on the way up socialism on the way down cronyism bloated government bailouts but the difference is the US has Ai and a tech sector that just creates so much economic value and draws capital from the rest of the world that at least props up or wallpapers over our problems more so than those other three nations what do you think absolutely correct yeah so that's the that's my summary that you know which is the fact that um you know like it just pains me that in terms of the fact that I don't even compare America to these other countries because America is still the beacon for the world right it's still the largest economy that everyone looks up to to see as to what is American doing and the American brand of capitalism unfortunately has been dented but you're right that these anglos sax and other economies that you pointed out are arguably uh in worse shape and doing things even uh worse than America is and America as you point out has the success of the tech engine in there but again it's slightly concerning to me that the like in America the domination is getting so concentrated that the value is being created but it's been created in just very few select companies you know and I think that that is a real problem and communities yes yeah it is really striking what do you think about the notion of so the one thing we didn't talk about that I think plays a big role in all of this is immigration policy um compare and contrast different immigration policies across the Nations you look at and what do you think is sort of if you will the ideal if there is an ideal immigration policy and what does it indicate in terms of America's immigration policy yeah I think that you know as far as America's concerned even though it's been a big problem in America and it's a big political issue America's at least been better at uh assimilating immigrants than a lot of European countries uh in that regard and I think that countries like you know a Australia and all you know have been you know like pretty good in terms of as well so I'd say that generally here the Anglo Saxon world has been better than Europe in terms of assimilation of immigrants but again as I said that you know what is good economics is not always you know what's with politics which is that even last year like I was I pointed out that immigration is what really helped uh countries like America avoid a recession and bring inflation down much uh more than in other countries did uh uh last year but the problem is the fact that it's become such a political issue about tearing apart the social Fabric and stuff that what is good economics in obvious terms is not good politics and I don't see that changing so I'd say that yes I think that immigration is out of control uh for many people out here in America and so we we're going to get a clamp down on that uh regardless I think of what happens in uh November but in general I would say America and the Anglo-Saxon countries like Australia have done a better job at assimilating immigrants compared to European countries like France well let me say something that's um I don't know is is rot with with emotion is it that we've done a better job of assimilating or we attract a different type of immigrant well it could be both I think a combination of both right which is that in terms of what's happening but I just look at it more from a similation but then you start getting into Cal issues in terms of who's coming and what's happening and that just gets a very slippery slope in terms of looking at immigration in that regard so looking at all the economies in the world what two or three economies are you most bullish on in terms of you mentioned that Canada's doing really poorly the UK is doing really poorly America you would argue is kind of like it sounds like average to slightly above average any other role models for you know I think of certain countries in Southeast Asia or I think of Singapore where we can look at um the way they've managed their economy and think this is this is the role model well I yeah I think like it depends on the time frame but I think that the uh you know like the economies that are you know have been sort of good again which is the economy that's doing the best in Europe these days it's Greece right which is that this is a country which till 10 years ago was like an example of a complete yeah if I can say so a basket case uh in terms of that but just look at how well Greece has come back it's booming now it was again forced this is what crisis does it is one uh Silver Lining of a crisis it said it's the only time when governments reform or change things is when you a crisis so Greece runs out of money it's on the verge of default and then you end up getting a lot of Reform so Greece I think has you know been a comeback story in fact in general the clubm countries of late have been doing better than their Continental uh payers but Greece is an example of that then secondly I would point to is a like in Eastern Europe in general I'd say Poland is a shining example of that which is that it's a country which I think is next classified to becoming a developed country remember that in the world today there are more than 200 Nations only 40 or so are classified as developed countries everybody is else is classified as emerging and many of them uh from Brazil to Mexico have been emerging forever right so but I'd say that is uh it feel a while since a major Nation joined the ranks of the developed countries I think the next one to do so could be Poland uh which is on the brink of you know getting a per capita income of you know $20,000 or so which makes it like a developed country again a lot it's done right from having a very competitive manufacturing sector not too many flashy billionaires and in general I'd say that the election result in Poland last year sort of also took away some political risk because it's a much more Cooperative government uh that you have in place Visa uh the EU and the European Union helped it give it uh some pretty strong institutions so I'd say that like I feel relatively optimistic about these countries uh outside of the core of Europe from Greece to Poland uh as you know like for different reasons one's a comeback star and the other one's been a consistent star in the postcommunist world and just before you go we'd be remiss if we didn't ask you about China you thoughts well I've been parish and China for a while now because I you know in terms of what's been happening to its both uh the two pillars of growth really which is that it's been relying a lot on you know like when China boomed it had great demographics and of course when the boom slow down it could still rely on on taking on more and more debt to keep going those engines are now down uh so I feel that China is in a secular decline on a fundamental basis I don't see China growing at a rate of more than 2 or 3% for the foreseeable future so I'd say that uh yeah for now it seems that the risk of a blow up in China has you know sort of been papered over because they've again done what it takes to keep the economy afloat but the problem in China is the fact that they can't get away from the basic notion that there is no country in the world which is able to grow rapidly or even grow when it has a negative population growth rate that headwind is just very hard to overcome and then second obviously is the debt issue in China where China has you know took on so much debt over the last decade because it ambitiously wanted to keep its growth rate up uh but now it you know it's been forced to pay back that debt in a way uh you know with the property sector and all which took a lot of that debt in the dogghouse so I feel that yeah the China may not have a blow up or a crisis but it's sort of going the way where the growth rate keeps slipping and sliding and you know 2 or 3% is the growth rate for China which is a far cry from where it was a decade ago rasher Sharma is Chairman of Rockefeller International and
