we had 500,000 people staying at airb B for the Paris Olympics that's equivalent of like eight Olympic stadiums were the people and 50,000 new homes were listed on airb just for that reason when Taylor Swift came and she did her uh International tour you could literally predict her tour by looking at the rising occupancy of airbnbs and it was like a massive phenomenon and sure tour uh generated a bigger business lift than some giant international events that would be in these cities [Music] okay here with Brian chesky just upfront disclosure Airbnb uh I am a shareholder it's one of my biggest Holdings I'm a big fan of the company um anyways enough of that Brian where does this podcast find you I'm actually in New York though I usually live in San Francisco I'm in the airbnb's office here in New York got it I've always thought and me we'll come back we'll talk specifically about Airbnb but I've always thought you guys are a great forward-looking indicator of where the economy is headed and travel Trends and consumer spending and what people spending money on what what can you provide insight into in terms of the economy and travel Trends as evidenced by uh what's happening on your platform one of the things that I think is so notable in the last year was this the year of events on Airbnb you know you saw the Paris Olympics we had 500,000 people staying at airb B for the Paris Olympics that's equivalent of like eight Olympic stadiums were the people and 50,000 new homes were listed me just for that reason um when Taylor Swift came and she did her uh International tour you can literally predict her tour by looking at the rising occupancy of airbnbs and it was like a massive phenomenon and Sh tour uh generated a bigger business lift than some giant international events that would be in these cities so we're starting to see like a lot of more people want to gather for events and why are they doing that I think people are Desiring connection they want to get out of the house they want to have a shared experience they want to have the experience of other people this often involves traveling more and more people are not living in the same city as people they grow up with and so they have to travel to see them they do more of these annual trips together um we're seeing a huge boom um in ski destinations um that's like really popular so like the Austrian Alps Italian Alps the French Alps this winter seeing a lot more people go to Southeast Asia so basically the summary is that travel is go is going strong I think that it's just the very beginning you know I think as emerging middle classes um form the one of the first things people want to do is travel and as the econom is strong more people will travel so that's what we're seeing I've heard there was sort of this Revenge travel uh Trend after after covid and that I've actually talked to some Hotel operators saying that actually travel has started to WAN a little bit uh because people kind of got there that itch scratched um and now it's starting to come back a little bit are you seeing the same Trends we're what we're seeing is like what I would describe as like probably the the post-pandemic kind of equilibrium so during the pandemic there was like basically three things didn't happen people didn't go to cities they didn't cross Porters and they didn't travel for business and so you had this different type of travel that we benefited from that hotels didn't which is people getting in cars and staying in big homes and more rural or like less Urban destinations then you had this huge boom which I think was a little bit of a natural amount of pent-up demand I think the pent up demand has now subsided and now we're in the new world the new world though is quite lot of travel and I think it's going to continue to grow but it's definitely not like the pent-up demand era of like 2021 2022 now we still grow because we grow through all that any Trends in terms of demographics around who's traveling more who's traveling less and what it says about the health of our economy there's a lot more people are traveling in groups you know before the pandemic it was a lot of like solo Travelers and couples now it's fames and um I think there's a couple explanations for why I mean one obvious demographic shift it's like Scott I mean I started as coming I was 26 I'm like a millennial and um and most 26y olds don't have families but like essentially there was a big question when people are in their 30s and 40s do they age at Airbnb or do they keep using Airbnb well luckily for us the answer is they kept using Airbnb and a lot of those people now have families so there's a whole generation of people that started as single people then they used Airbnb for like couples travels and now they're using her for Family Travel the additionally I just think a lot of families are now realizing airb be is a better solution for a lot of travel than hotels we have this big advertising campaign it's kind of a almost like a reference as the Mac versus PC campaign it's kind of like air me vers hotels we kind of show that for Family Travel for Group Travel like people being able to stay in a house be able to cook together not be separate in different rooms is really compelling so that's probably the big one the other one we're seeing we're seeing a couple others um people are staying longer the length of stay is going up and I think maybe the answer to that the explanation is people more flexibility right the fact is like 10 years ago it would be Unthinkable for you and I to do an interview unless we were in the same city together and now with zoom and this technology we can be able to do that so I think there's a lot more flexibility and then I think people are just chopping into more locations right I think you know before everyone went to Rome everyone went to Paris everyone to Vegas everyone to Miami they're still going to all those places but they're also going to a lot of smaller towns and cities and different destinations I think social media drives that because there's a lot of new destination discovery on Instagram Tik Tok and others so I I follow you and I read your earnings releases and you talked about um a new fature you guys are working on called the co-host Network can you say more about that you know Airbnb we only as good as the homes we have and you know one of the keys to Airbnb is we want to make sure Airbnb is Affordable well let's take a city if a city doesn't build housing what happens to the price of housing it typically goes up if we don't add enough airbnbs then the price of Airbnb goes up so we need to add a lot more Supply literally millions of millions ions more homes we want to add in the coming years the number one reason people don't list their home on Airbnb is because they perceive it as being too much work and it is for some people and let's say like you live in New York and you have a like a summer home in Florida or maybe you maybe use it in the winter actually um and uh and you want to put on Airbnb but you're not physically there so either you can host or you go on Google and you type like you know Airbnb property manager and a thirdparty property management company has nothing to do Airbnb could take over um custody of your property but why that is a problem is the average five star rating for thirdparty property managers airb is only like 4.62 which is not nearly as high a rating as individual hosts so we thought what if we like took a Marketplace approach to this what if we paired homeowners people with homes that don't have time that want to make extra money with people that have time they're really great hos in Airbnb and they would like to expand but they don't have access to property themselves and so that's exactly what we've done we built a network of 10,000 co-hosts these are the best local hosts the average rating is 4.85 so these are like great hosts and we'll match you with them and the other thing is not only do we match you Scott but we built this really elegant in a software integration I I think when you if you get to get your hands on I think you'll you'll hope agree that it's a really beautiful seamless integration so they can manage everything about your Airbnb or just the bookings or just the cleaning or just the checking in of guests you negotiate the rate with them and so you know it's pretty trinky let's break down the economics I own a place in SoHo and I decide all right I want to monetize it or I want to get some return on it and let's just say I can rent it off for 500 bucks a night if I rent it out for five bucks 500 bucks a night how much would I typically end up hanging to Airbnb and how much if I totally wanted outsourc it of that 500 bucks would go to a co-host I'm trying to figure out the net to the owner we have a blended take rate of 15% so um now now if you if you rent it out for $500 a night you actually get 97% of it because we withhold 3% and then we add an additional about 12% additional guess fee but let's just keep the math really simple and let's assume that you're saying $500 a night is with the guest pays right just to keep the math simple so it's $500 time uh you know .15 you know and that's 75 bucks y yep so that's $75 and then you know with a co-host you'll probably negotiate between 10 20 30% take rate and it's basically what you negotiate and how much they take home so I think it's very reasonable even with the coast that you could take 60 70% home we'll be right back you strike me as sort of Ground Zero for a company that could potentially leverage AI I want understand how you're using AI where you've seen real Roi where it may have been overhyped I'm just curious as a as a business owner that I imagine is being pitched by you know I imagine you and Sam have had a lot of conversations and that there's a lot of AI companies that would love to put out a press release saying we're the exclusive AI partner maybe you've already done this with Airbnb but I would like to get one you're how you're using Ai and two just as a business person who has real insight into technology where you think a is underhyped or overhyped I think ai's long-term impact on society is perhaps underhyped I think that you know anyone that has a child today the world they're going to grow up in is going to be so fundamentally different than they can imagine because of what happens when computers can essentially think and I think it's going to change society but I remember in like I don't know mid 2010s there was the self-driving car craze and people were saying in 2014 2015 that there be very few people that would be driving cars that driving a car would be anachronistic like riding a horse and you would only do it if you enjoyed it and while that's probably the long-term truth we're almost 10 years post self-driving car craze and it's still very rare to see a self-driving car on the road and so I think the lesson here is that this technology is going to have a much bigger impact on society than probably think but it's a what's that old saying you overestimate what you can done in in a year and you underestimate what's possible in 10 years I think we and still can value do that all the time we invent a technology and we think society's just going to adopt it and it's going to take a lot longer and so I think that all of us were way too panish when chat launched and I think we all thought all of our businesses were going to change in 3 or four years and honestly like if I just like I don't know here's a good test I I open my phone I look at the apps on my home screen I ask how many of these apps have fundly change because generative Ai and I really can't say very many have maybe the algorithms are marginally different there's some interesting kind of on the margins filters that are possible because of AI but their experience is not that different than a prei AI startup so I would say if you think about the stack you've got the model um you so you got the chips there's a lot of development there mostly just Nvidia now there's a huge amount of development at the model level obviously open AI was the kind of was the Frontier Model but there's so many others but there's been very little Innovation on the app front and I think all of us are trying to basically figure out like what is the application interface Paradigm um in a like AI world one of the comments that Johnny I made he's a designer that I work very closely with he designed you know almost all the products between iMac and you know iPad Beyond as he noticed that there was a user interface Paradigm of the graphical user interface formed in the 1970s popularized in 1980s basically a mouse and a point and click and then you had multi-touch introduced in 2007 with the iPhone so a lot of startups are starting to work on these new layers but um you know mostly what these startups are doing is scraping data the kind of same data that open AI would scrape or the data that um Google would scrape and they're just trying to do marginally different interfaces by doing these kind of pseudo you know assistance but the assistants are very chatbot and I think a chatbot is just you know you know why I don't think a chap bot's the right interface for the same reason that like I have a messaging app but I don't want to use that to do the calcul like to to to do a computation I want to open a calculator and I have a different interface for the calculator so in other words I think every job wants a different interface and I don't think we can revert to that like the universal chapot interface to be able to handle all these different tasks it actually is very inefficient for things like travel I don't think a chapot is the way to book travel so that's like my general commentary now let's take Airbnb um I think the thing that will first get revolutionized through AI via Airbnb as customer service um just to give you a sense we have a very got very difficult customer service challenge we get more than 10 million calls and um chats a year um they come from people in every country in the world and a lot of the calls are Urgent like I'm locked out there's a problem and we often have to adjudicate disputes between a guest and a host that don't even speak the same language and you know because we're travel we have a lot of seasonal workers right like and so the seasonal workers is a lot of turnover and um so you you'll often call a customer service agent that is seasonal and a lot of them are new and they're trying to handle like adjudication between guest and host and there's like a hundred different policies and the policies can be like a 100 pages of documentation and so AI can be the front line it can basically speak like speak every language it can be 247 it can read the Corpus of all your policies it can also look the last million times something happened and say based on that this is the best predicted resolution and of course it can be a tool for customer service agents to provide better service so I think customer service is the first thing that's going to be reinvented at least in the e-commerce space because of AI and then I think the question is can you bring that customer service Paradigm to search in other words can search be not a chatbot but a sightly more conversational experience where it's not like the Amazon Paradigm where it's a search box and filters but it's a little bit more this app that's getting to know you understanding you it's more personalized and that would probably be phase two I've sort of and I might have this wrong but I was really just fascinated by The Meta earnings call I think it was turnings calls ago where he said and I've never seen this before we've increased our revenues 23% year on year while decreasing our headcount 20% and what I've generally found the analogy I would use is that AI is a little bit like corporate OIC and that is it turns off the signal we have as managers CEOs and directors that just because we're growing doesn't need we need to eat more or in this case we don't need to hire more have you thought and I realize this is a difficult conversation for cosos to have but has AI given you the sense to maybe rethink if you need more employees and to see how technology can make you more efficient and I'll what's happened to your employee headcount over the last 12 months I went through one of the first big layoffs in Silicon Valley you know since the pandemic we were like kind of a well-known layoff it was we had cut 25% employees but actually we lost like almost half the employees cuz we also had to cut 10% of contigent workers and then when you're a travel coming the pandemic like people tend to leave you for other hotter Fields so or other other Industries so we ran the experiment of having significantly fewer employees against her will we weren't looking to do this and something remarkable happened the remarkable thing happened is that we actually started getting more work done with fewer people and it was partly because there was a massive communication tax and that like people are in meetings all day and there are meetings all day because people create meetings and you can try to impose things but it was just it turned out we had too many people probably and we we never would have realized that until we kind of ran the experiment of having fewer people and we actually started getting a lot more done so then I you know mentioned this to Mark Zuckerberg and uh you know I'm close to him and um you know I I think he kind of realized that um you know there were a lot of efficiencies to be gained and um you know obviously he made his decisions with this year of efficiency I think he found that there was a huge communication tax and that they probably had way too many people now it's hard for a CEO because you don't want to always be on the side against hiring people I'll say this I think that most startups raise too much money they hire too many people I don't think that has to be against workers I think that they can just be redistributed to other companies that we should fund more companies there should be more startups built but that startups should probably not hire so many people I think that's a general view I have ai I think is making people marginally more efficient but I've not seen um yet a massive displacement of workers because of AI um you know whether it's customer service we still have mostly agents doing it and then software engineering you know it it can it can make software developers a lot more efficient but it is not reducing our Workforce and actually the way this would probably work is we'd probably in if AI made a r more efficient instead of um downscaling the employee base we'd probably try to get more Revenue per employee so we wouldn't be doing we wouldn't be eliminating jobs we would hope that the revenue per employee would increase so they have more leverage and we're starting to see this we're starting to see that the like what we're seeing is our headcount is only growing in low single digigit percentages year-over-year and a revenue is growing fast in our headcount and I'd like that to continue and so a metric of Revenue per employee or free cash flow per employee hopefully will massively increase we won't have fewer employees we'll just do more Revenue so you had a bit of a viral moment you probably weren't planning this and I um I just want to say I thought your comments were sort of taken out of context around founder mode talk a little bit about what you meant and you know it kind of It kind of went wild everyone my favorite meme was I'm going to go founder mode on this breakfast burrito founder mode question mark let me say this um I'm not sure anyone really knows what founder mode is cuz Paul G mod an essay about it but he never described exactly what it was so let me just give a little B backstory I was asked to go to see a why to Y ComEd or alumni event it was the first time they got basically a 100 startups that are you know like around a billion dollar market cap or higher later stage companies they did a basically like like a the quot of a conference they had different speakers I joined last minute it was off the record I remember they telling you like you're going to do this talk and no one's ever going to know you did this talk it's off the Record there will be no knowledge of it so I do this talk off the Record and I basically describe my experience um from 2009 to 2019 going through hyper growth but the problem was I was told um a certain philosophy of leadership which is you hire you know higher grade people and UST them and Empower them to do their job and that sounds great but there was a big missing piece of the puzzle which was being in the details and being close and I had let go and I noticed this Paradox that the more I let go the more dysfunctional company got um the more people thought it was leadership meddling and so the further I got from the details of the company and I would hire these people and I thought they were doing a good job and I would find out years later they weren't doing the job I thought they were doing because I wasn't close enough to the job so I think Paul Graham wrote this essay it was a very compelling essay I think the theory is a really great way he framed it that there's this orientation that isain the founders which is being in the details having real ownership of your company which is different than the classic manager mode but to be clear I never said this was something exclusive to Founders basically the general principle is being in the details and um and being very very Hands-On and it's this basic idea that great leadership is not absence great leadership is presence and then the Counterpoint is well what about like isn't this sound like micromanagement isn't this micromanagement and no one wants to work for a micromanager and here are my two thoughts on micromanagement number one I actually think like a lot of people are afraid to get in the details because be accused of being a micromanager and I actually think a lot more leaders would benefit from being the details and model more Hands-On leadership but the other thing is what Steve Jobs said because what I took from founder mode a lot of it was what I learned observing Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs said he didn't believe was a man a found a mro manager because he said that what I do is I'm in the details but I'm partnering with the people and if you asked Johnny I I don't think Johnny I thought M Steve Jobs was a micromanager but Steve Jobs visited designs to you every single day they had lunch every single day together they were talking Steve was steeped in every detail of the design of the iPhone but he wasn't telling Johnny what to do they were having discussions they were partnering and I think that's the key I remember one time at had an employee and they asked me is this your decision or is this my decision and I said that's exactly the problem every decision should be our decision this this notion of this black and white um like decision-making Authority between owner and worker manager an employee is I think the problem that you're kind of partnering with people in the details working with them and so that was probably the single most important philosophy that as a founder or as a leader you set the pace of the organization you set the standards of of of equality you set the standard of how much you care you identify Excellence that you work with the leaders on the ground and you don't defer to them but you don't tell them what to do you're constantly partnering with them and one reason you shouldn't defer to your leaders is because often times you'll have different leaders come from different functions with different incs and they'll conf fct and you're the only leader or maybe if you're a general manager you're one of the ones that can actually consolidate and have the most global view and make the most macro decision based on all the different inputs so let's talk a little bit about the company and the stock and you're a public company CEO so you can plead the fifth on anything here or just say you can't comment but your revenues two and three quarter billion most recent quarter that's up double digits that's up 11% year onye net income over half a billion 555 million representing a net income margin of 20% Which is very healthy adjusted divitaa of about 894 million up 9% year onye and represented an adjusted evot to margin of 33% these are solid numbers uh Airbnb generated a billion of free cash flow on Q2 and 4.3 billion of free cash flow over the trailing 12 months which is I think the most you've ever done um now the bad news since the company went public it's for trade to retail investors and I fig we went public four or five years ago um it's it's effectively flat if you purchase a stock you're effectively flat I mean there's been some bumps and some some UPS some downs but is this a case of where quite frankly you went public in a market that was very frothy and the company is growing into that valuation you know at some point investors are going to get or shareholders are going to get rustless and say this is a great company that's growing how come it's not reflected in the stock price what is it is CEO is it you're going to continue to block and tackle and just continue to stay the course do you think it might involve Acquisitions moving forward but what would you say to a shareholder who's been in the stock the last four years and quite frankly it's underperformed the rest of the market I think there's a couple things going on I think that beginning of 2020 we had a private Market valuation of 30 billion then the pandemic hit and we raised debt and the warrants were priced to 18 billion so that might be the best proxy for evaluation in May of 20 April 2020 we were 18 billion then we our goal in the summer was to go public at 30 billion like we don't want the last round investors to be underwater so we would like to clear 30 billion and then by the time we priced the stock we priced it at 50 billion and then the first day closing went to 100 billion and that was crazy and it was not what we expected um I did not think the stock would pop double if I did I probably would have increased the issue price and we probably at that point had a valuation that was a little ahead of our numbers we were not generating a huge amount of free cash flow we were not profitable on an eBid basis in 2020 the market was super frothy so now you know there's this old saying you know you're never as good as they seem you're never as bad as they seem were we as good as they seemed in 2020 I don't know maybe we got a little frothy but we're certainly not as bad as people say now um you know those that are that are a little bit cynical of the company I mean you know you us to you mentioned we did like over 4 billion free cash flow we have one of the highest free cash flow margins in all of Silicon Valley you know we put out a little bit software guidance for a quarter and that like really made had a huge impact on the stock price because investors they'll like kind of forecast the subtle changeing growth rate over the next five or 10 years and it massively changed your valuation what I would just say is the following I'm 43 I intend to you know continue to run this company for the coming decades I want to build build one of the great defining generational companies and I'm spending a lot of energy taking Airbnb which was basically a noun and a verb that's one vertical and trying to do what Amazon did in the late 90s which was take a platform e-commerce platform that's designed for books and bring it to everything and I think that there's going to be a massive amount of category expansion for Airbnb Beyond short-term rentals so you're going to start to see that next year we have some really exciting ideas that we're working on um but beyond that there's a huge amount of growth in our Core Business and I would just point to a few things number one quality control we are now bumping up against the growth rate of what airb we can kind of grow its growth rate without better quality control because we are now an alternative to hotels a lot of Hotel Travers comparing airbnbs and they want the similar level of consistency and quality for every person who stays in Airbnb nine people stay in a hotel if you can get one of those people to stay Airbnb we double the size of our business and then you've got International markets you know most of our business is in like six or seven countries so we're in 220 countries but most of our business is in US Canada Australia UK France so there's so many opportunities in Asia I mean there's many countries in Europe Latin America where there's huge growth expansion so that's the next Frontier okay so without revealing your corporate plans I I think of Airbnb Loosely is you're great at monetizing fallow assets and creating community and that might be the wrong description but but that's how I think of of it so what are the most monetizable assets people's homes you're kind of in that uh next would be commercial real estate um I could see I don't like apparel people have tried that it isn't working um I could see private jets I could see you know there what am I missing what are in your view without giving oh you're you're missing the biggest one of all people's time so like skill share tell us what you mean by that well what do I say without saying it um there's a lot of services that are available that we could go into so imagine Amazon they had books but they went initially into DVDs and CDs when those existed and then all these different retail categories so we're looking at um let me just break it down for you so you have short-term rentals which cor you have long-term rentals long-term rental to be defined as 30 days or longer so that's the same asset but for longer days and seasonal that's huge then yes you do have like car rentals and boats and other large assets um they're not as big as her house but those are your next biggest Assets in your life um but again the biggest asset are people's time so services and experiences would be a big opportunity for us um but as far as like going down the list of those categories there are dozens and dozens of categories but I I I'll kind of start to accidentally talk and reveal our new product if I do that but just a double click on that I'm outstanding at installing energy efficient HVAC and I'm in delr beach and I'm very good at installing solar pan panels or installing soap stone kitchen counters and homes that need this my problem is new business uh can I see an environment where I put my services and pictures and photos similar the way you would advertise an apartment on your platform and you bring them a bunch of business and assure a certain level of quality in exchange for that 15% fee everybody wins is that is that a logical extension that's a logical extension it wouldn't be the first extension um we would probably start with things a little more adjacent to travel into hosting an Airbnb but down the road almost any type of service I mean not I want say almost any type of service but many services including Building Maintenance Cleaning interior design you know upcap your property they we you know we built the co platform this Co Network we build we took lessons from Amazon and the lesson from Amazon is don't build the book Marketplace based on isbns build an abstracted marketplace where you can sell diapers and books and a number of things on the same platform so that's what we've done we basically re architected the entire platform and so there's many services that could use the co Network and then on the demand side there we're we're you know I'll probably stop there because there's you know but you'll see there'll be more things coming and when you're thinking is is kind of 2025 the year where you start rolling out testing adj every year I made a statement on the earnings call I I believe I can stick with it which is every year for now on we're going to launch two to three new businesses or verticals that we believe will one day generate an incremental billion dollars of Revenue or more so um you're going to start to see those next year and will you do this organically or will you make small tucking Acquisitions to give you a head start in these primarily organically and the reason why is because similar to Apple when Steve ran it were a functional organization and so it's kind of difficult organization you to plug in like businesses because they need become divisions um but you know if there's small Acquisitions or if it's extremely compelling we'll always take a look at it and I mean I will just say like a lot of entrepreneurs really want to work with Airbnb um they're very motivated I think we have a very entrepreneurial culture especially for an S&amp;P 500 company so um it is a very impaling place for an acquisition candidate well let me just ask you this you've got a $85 billion market cap sorry 8 8485 billion market cap list the number two has a $6 billion market cap so you'd have to pay a premium 8 billion for 10% delution why wouldn't you take a flyer and become the number two and then maybe the number one and terms of um sharing or monetizing people's cars I mean these are like there's I think there's a lot of opportunities one of the one of the Frameworks that Jeff bezos's had I think um is this idef perishable non-p perishable opportunities and I think doing an acquisition most of those Acquisitions are not perishable I mean maybe someone else could take them out but we generally think that we want to get a little more momentum in the core business get to a little bit larger scale before we tried to absorb large companies and large acquisitions so that's kind of why we've tried to build our muscle having done Acquisitions in the past they're very very time consuming I think Acquisitions benefit larger corporations because they can absorb the acquisition right I think a smaller company struggles with just the administrative you think of yourself as a small you're $84 billion market cap you're by far in way the largest hotel company in the world by number of rooms growth you have solid IA it's just funny that you think that way I would think that we're a baby compared to what we're become we and by the way we only have 7,000 employees or so I think Uber has like 30,000 so yeah maybe today they're double the market cap but they also have like four to five times the number of employees so we're actually a smaller company from an employee base Than People realize we try to build like this not a Navy but like the Navy Seals this lean Elite group but I think this is just the very beginning like I got to tell you Scott I'm 43 but I have more energy more motivation and more passion than I was when I was 26 and I was running this company and I just see endless opportunity for this company I thing we've done a lot of the hard work to rebuild our company from the ground up to be prepared for this next phase where we can take airb be and bring it to more business models around the world so I mean yeah just maybe it's a mindset you know Jeff like Ste Steve Jobs said Apple's the world's biggest startup and you know I think you know what he means by that Jeff Bezos had his version he called it day one it's all basically is the road in front of you longer than the road behind you and for us it is so I pitched you on this idea of privately 18 months ago and the stute of limitations are over so I can pitch it to you publicly but Airbnb Plus or whatever we call it and I pay 50 bucks a month and it does a few things one when I'm in a city I have access to cool gyms like in Equinox or whatever I have um access to coner services but more than anything it's a thinly veiled aspirational community/ dating site and that is I travel so much and when I'm in a town I'm almost always alone and I find myself at 5 or 600 or 7:00 p.m. thinking I don't know what to do and if there were other entrepreneurs if there were other academics if there were other people from New York or just locals what about some sort of Airbnb plus Community um um offering I think it's incredibly compelling I think you sold me I'm in listen 18 months ago I was in when you told me and the only reason we haven't done it is cuz we had really foundational things people were complaining about airb AR affordable they were complaining about our customer service they were complaining about like there were a lot of thing there were a lot of complaints and so I felt like we got we ought to get our house in order we still have to grow into this valuation we have to generate a real consistent profit on a free cash flow basis and we have to address a lot of these issues that customers have brought up and over the last two years we made 430 upgrades and improvements so yes we are now looking for this expansion I've always believed that there was some type of airb membership model not necessarily A points program but where you get access and I I guess my only question back to you is are you available as an adviser oh Jesus Christ Brian you're you're so full of I'm always available I'm always you know I love this company we're going to talk privately after this anyway but I think it's a great idea and I generally do see Airbnb as a community I mean like in in you know Berlin tonight there are tens of thousands of Airbnb people that are staying there we can match them together they can do variety things those local businesses would love to have specific Travelers and they could tell us which Travelers they want and we could Target just those Travelers I think there's a social overlay here and that is I think that there's a crisis or an epidemic and loneliness 100% and young people aren't connecting in a safe environment uh where they they want to know each other and want to want to establish professional and personal relationships there's a lack of third spaces you know people aren't going into work they aren't going to church they aren't participating in organized Athletics as much and I think the you guys are in a position to provide third spaces on a on a pretty big scale look and now I'm going to sound like your mother here last time you were on the show you spoke about feeling like a 61 year old and a you were 41 there so 43 year old's body working 18 hours a day essentially living like a monk during the pandemic to scale Airbnb from 18 to 85 billion so over a year later have you been able to make strides and reconnecting with your the personal side of your life do you found as if you found more balance or is still kind of an ongoing Journey no it's been a major change for me um kind of three changes the first change is I've gotten much healthier I was always into exercise but um I've I think a a lot of entrepreneurs we glamorize sleep deprivation and I think until recently no one was talking about the benefits of sleep I think only last five or 10 years but in the two when I started like it was a badge of honor to never sleep and I do that for years and you know we didn't really like we weren't that healthy and I I'm much more healthy now I'm sleeping more I'm exercising and I think I think that's a good Trend to Silicon Valley that like people seem to be much more mindful of health and fitness that's the first thing um second thing is I'm spending a lot more time with friends and I one of the things I do with friends is I travel you and I talked about like one of the great ways to have a shared experience is to travel with people and like that's a great form of memories and I do that and then I've started to um the third category is like I'm single and I'm 43 and I've waited longer than thought I would to meet someone and have a family but I do desire to have a family and so I've been dating a little bit and you know hopefully I meet someone and you also said on the professional front you talked about your desire for Airbnb to have a next ACT your Disneyland your AWS your iPhone moment yes give me a moonshot crazy idea that you wouldn't people wouldn't expect from Airbnb or Brian chesy there's so many but I'll just pick one based on the conversation had loneliness people are lonely I think there's a massive way that we can facilitate people meeting one another so I'll give you an example if you travel by yourself you ever go to a restaurant you got to eat at the bar by yourself and sometimes all the time it's literally one of my favorite things and it's pathetic yeah yeah and and it I I do it too actually um you know I do go to the bar and sometimes by myself get food and I like it but I have no alternative like if I'm traveling by myself that's the only choice so what if we could basically pair and me Travelers together at restaurants pre-book reservations and bring Travelers together t Swift um number two she like um obviously had this incredibly unprecedent successful concert tour and we noticed in Europe where her concert was we saw this massive rise in every bookings and what if you could pair what if you could sell concert tickets on Airbnb but not to sell concert tickets but you could actually pair people together to go to the concerts they can meet one another um and we could go down the list of other types of things like pickup Sports so there are kind of things you might not think of as Airbnb but if we're talking about um difficulty meeting one another there's a lot of ways we can pair people together so I think the most not obvious biggest idea would be Airbnb becoming like a social network in the physical world not an online social network but essentially a physical social network where we're matching people together in real life around events and shared experiences God I just thought of it you should take on Live Nation um and by the way I love the idea of you sitting alone at a bar and everybody being like isn't that Brian chest by the way you know what I call when I see I'm not young nor a billionaire and not as good-looking as you you know what I call eye contact at a bar when I'm meeting alone what a prostitute oh anyways there you go all right Brian Brian's literally turning red great way to land this interview this is great he's literally turning beat red here Brian chesky is the co-founder and CE of Airbnb since launching in 2007 The Firm has grown to a community of over 5 million hosts who have welcomed more than two billion guests in almost every country across the globe he joins us from New York Brian you know I'm an enormous fan of you I think you're you're not only a baller professionally in the world of tech but I think you're just generally speaking a good person and think about uh the Commonwealth and what's good for society and we don't always have that panut butter and chocolate combination so thanks for your time well thank you so much Scott thank you for having me
