## Core Framework: PEACE Sound Bites

Five sound bites every business needs. They spell PEACE:

| Step | Sound Bite | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| **P** | Problem | The hook - makes your solution valuable |
| **E** | Empathy | "We know how you feel" - positions you as guide |
| **A** | Answer | Your product - the rope into the hole |
| **C** | Change | Transformation - what they become |
| **E** | End Result | Happily ever after - life after purchase |

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Problem First = Value
> "If you're in a hole and I throw down a rope, that rope is extremely valuable. If you're not in a hole and I hand you a rope, you put it in your garage and forget about it."

**Application:** Never lead with "I'm the CEO of..." or "We're a software consultancy..."
Lead with the problem you solve.

### 2. One Thing
> "Human beings want one thing. They can't carry all these bowling balls of information."

> "Commas are not your friend. Don't give a list. One problem."

**Application:** Choose ONE controlling idea for Wilde Agency.

### 3. Curiosity, Not Explanation
> "The job of front steps is NOT to explain nuance. It's to make people stop and say 'Can you tell me more?'"

> "If they change the subject, you haven't dialed it in."

### 4. Oneliner Formula
**Problem → Product → Result**

Example (therapist):
"A lot of couples wonder whether they should get married. I'm a therapist who meets with you twice and tells you whether you should. So you don't spend a lifetime married to someone you regret."

### 5. Specificity Reduces Cognitive Dissonance
> "I'm a therapist who helps you figure out if you should get married" = C-
> "I meet with you twice and tell you whether you should get married" = A+

The specific plan removes uncertainty.

## The Hole Metaphor

Every story = Hero in a hole who needs to get out

1. **Problem** = Describe hero in hole
2. **Empathy** = Guide looks in, says "I'm sorry you're in that hole"
3. **Answer** = Guide throws rope (product) into hole
4. **Change** = Hero climbs out, transforms
5. **End Result** = Life outside the hole

## YNAB Example (Perfect Model)

| Sound Bite | YNAB Version |
|------------|--------------|
| **Problem** | "Have you ever worried about money?" |
| **Empathy** | "We know how you feel." |
| **Answer** | "Download the YNAB app." |
| **Change** | "Get good with money." |
| **End Result** | "So you'll never worry about money again." |

**Full sentence:**
"Have you ever worried about money? We know how you feel. Download the YNAB app and get good with money so you'll never worry about money again."

**Controlling idea:** "Get good with money" (became their tagline)

---

## Gym Owner Example (Relevant to Services)

**Before:** "I own a gym" (worthless)

**After:** "I help men in their 50s add 10 years to their life. I own a gym."

**Even better:** "10 Years Longer" cohort at $1,000/mo vs $90/mo membership

> "I'll pay $1,000 a month to live 10 years longer, but I won't for a gym membership."

---

## Contractor Example (Premium Pricing)

Worcester Brian's pitch:
> "I only build one house a year. Word of mouth only. I never stop building your house - 30 years from now, if a light bulb goes out, call me. I'm more expensive than anyone and take longer, but it's done right."

**Result:** They didn't interview anyone else.

---

## Application to Wilde Agency

### Current Problem
"We're a software development consultancy" = "I own a gym"
(Worthless. Changes subject.)

### What We Need
**ONE controlling idea** that works for both tracks:

**Option A: Speed/Skip**
- "Skip 6 months of scaffolding"
- "Launch in weeks, not months"
- "Production-ready from day one"

**Option B: Expertise + AI**
- "What happens when senior engineers use AI"
- "Experience amplified by AI"
- "30 years of patterns, AI-accelerated"

**Option C: Worry-Free Tech**
- "Never worry about your tech stack again"
- "Build without becoming a software company"

---

## PEACE Framework for Wilde Agency

### Track 1: Venture Studio (Startups)

| Sound Bite | Draft |
|------------|-------|
| **Problem** | "Ever watched your runway burn while your devs build scaffolding instead of product?" |
| **Empathy** | "We've been there. As CTOs of three startups, we've felt that pressure." |
| **Answer** | "Apply to our Venture Studio pilot. We build on a battle-tested foundation." |
| **Change** | "Go from idea to production in weeks." |
| **End Result** | "So you can focus on customers, not infrastructure." |

### Track 2: AI Transformation (Established Business)

| Sound Bite | Draft |
|------------|-------|
| **Problem** | "Worried your business is falling behind because you can't hire developers?" |
| **Empathy** | "We hear this every day from business owners who don't want to become tech companies." |
| **Answer** | "Tell us what you need. We build it for you." |
| **Change** | "Get the software your business needs without the headache." |
| **End Result** | "So you can compete with anyone, without a tech team." |

## Oneliner Drafts

### Venture Studio Oneliner
"Most startups burn 6 months building scaffolding before writing a line of product code. We skip that. Apply to our Venture Studio and go from idea to production-ready in weeks—so you can focus on customers, not infrastructure."

### AI Transformation Oneliner
"A lot of business owners know they need software to compete, but they can't hire developers and don't want to become a tech company. We build custom software for you—so you get the tools you need without the tech headache."

## Controlling Idea Candidates

| Idea | Why It Works | Why It Might Not |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| "Skip the scaffolding" | Specific, tangible | Only resonates with technical folks |
| "Production-ready from day one" | Clear outcome | Jargon-y |
| "Weeks, not months" | Speed is universal | Everyone claims speed |
| "Senior engineers + AI" | Differentiated | Requires explanation |
| "Build without becoming a software company" | Perfect for Track 2 | Doesn't fit Track 1 |

**Recommendation:** May need TWO controlling ideas (one per track)

---

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Choose controlling idea for each track
2. [ ] Write full PEACE sound bites for each
3. [ ] Create oneliners for each
4. [ ] Test in conversations - do they ask "tell me more"?
5. [ ] Deploy everywhere: landing page, email sig, business card, intro
